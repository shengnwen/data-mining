More than just a collection of Jewish jokes, this book successfully attempts to dig into the way Jewish humor reflects the idiosyncrasies of the Jewish's mind.  Behind each joke the author searches its roots, the  social and historical context.  Enjoyable, well presented.  It helps if the  reader has a Jewish background, but it is quite accessible to the  open-minded &quot;goyim.&quot;  Have fun
