A well written story about a young orphaned girl's journey from Britain to Brazil where she begins a new life with very distant relatives who are only interested in the money they receive for keeping her.

This "new life" is a far cry from the happy and contented life she had enjoyed back home.  The daily cruelties are oppressive and would render her life bleak if it were not for the efforts of the governess who accompanied her from Britain and who remains to tutor
her and the girl twins of the Carters - the name of the tiny minded   and greedy family who took her in.  

It is a good story that emphasizes the freedom one can have in one's own mind to override the unpleasantness of daily circumstances.  It is a story that illustrates the great benefits of a liberal education that encourages a child's imagination.

The final chapters of the book tell of her discoveries along the Amazon River which she is finally free to explore.

Great reading for children between the ages of 9 and 12
