One of the most respected artists of the last century, Arthur Rackham brought some of the best loved children's stories to life with his beautiful illustrations.  Here, some of Rackham's illustrations for 17 of the Grimm's stories are presented in a colouring book format, and while it would make a wonderful gift for a child, it also makes for a great collector's item for the art connoisseur and fan of Rackham's work.  I bought two copies - one to colour, and one to keep as a collector's item!  Ed Sibbett, Jr. rendered the 30 colourable illustrations based on Rackham's originals, and each one compliments James Spero's adapted text of 17 of the Grimm's tales.  Included in the 64 pages are the classics &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, and more.  At Amazon's price, there's definitely value for money in this book
