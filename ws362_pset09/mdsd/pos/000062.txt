I don't know how much more I can say than all of the other reviews, but this is one of the best books I've read in quite a while.  In part this is due to the fantastic story telling of Ruiz Zafon, but also of the excellent job of translating by Lucia Graves.  Had this book not taken place in Barcelona and made several references about Spanish culture, I would have thought the original language had been English.   

As for the story I was completely engrossed by both the story, the characters, and their history.  I will admit that the length of the story could have been cut back a little bit, but at no point was I flipping ahead pages, either.  Ruiz Zafon tends to be very descriptive, but what I appreciated was that when he went into describing a character or an event in detail, it was interesting and had relevence to the plot.
