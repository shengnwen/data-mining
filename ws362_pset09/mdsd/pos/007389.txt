Joan Medlicott makes you feel like a friendly neighbor.  The characters are so believable that you want to drop over for tea. She keeps the story moving and leaves you anxious for her next book.  I love the series stories and am looking forward to reading the Mrs Parker book. "At Home in Covington" is a good easy read.
