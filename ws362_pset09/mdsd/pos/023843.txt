This book is awesome if you like to do crafts. I love doing crafts but I am not as crafty as other people. When me and the other bridesmaid started to do our invitations we thought we were getting in over our heads but the directions were easy and it turned out to be a great success. I posted the photos of our apron invitations on here for people to view. I highly recommend this book to anyone! It has a lot of different themes and beautiful invitations, decorations and ideas for bridal showers
