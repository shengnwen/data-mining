This memorizing book, will keep you thinking for days and wanting to come back  for more. Fire Storm is based on a woman named Kerry Murphy that works as a fire investigator with her dog, Sam that is supposed to be a trained arson dog. When she was a little girl some one set her house on fire, and the fire killed her mom, she ran out side to get help from a man standing across the street. The man hit her in the head with a metal object and she went into a coma for 2 years, then when she woke up she had psychic abilities that were triggered by fires. She never told no one, and went on being the best fire investigator and everyone thought that it was her dog's nose that found out the answers.
	This pretty much covers the first part of the book, which was pretty catchy and made you want to keep reading. I thought that the very beginning was pretty slow but it speed up pretty fast and got very interesting.
	Now brad silver is introduced into the story, he has psychic abilities too, but his are more critical than Kerry's; he can actually go into peoples mind and find out every thing about them and control their thoughts. Now Brad is after Trask, a man who killed two of his family members in a fire. Trask created Firestorm, some type of method where a fire instantly occurs just with a trigger. So he needs her to find out about Trask and where he is planning to attack next. 
	Kerry thinks that this is the man that started the fire that killed her mom so she agrees to help Brad, but she is in for a very rude surprise at the end of the story. Now I won't ruin the book for you so I will just say that this was a very good book. I don't believe in any of that mind reading stuff but this book makes it hard not to believe that its not true.
