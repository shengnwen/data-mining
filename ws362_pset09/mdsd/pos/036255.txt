She stood with a bullhorn and a bright orange vest in front of a doctor's home protecting the children who lived there, unarmed.

The invader's armoured tank kept on coming, hitting her, and backing up over her to make certain she was dead.

But she wasn't. Her spine snapped, she died painfully hours later as she was stopped at the invader's "security" checkpoint.

As any decent human being she stood unarmed and defenseless to protect children's ancient homes from destruction and land grab, even to the ultimate consequences. Such morality and courage is very rare today and shines in such great fellow American heroes as Jean Donovan, Sister Ita Ford, Sister Maura Clark and Sister Dorothy Kazel.

But they were in the last millenium, raped and murdered by other US allies and organs. Rachel is now, a hero for our new millenium. Our only American hero.

Please read her words and weep, not for her, but for all the children who loses homes and lives to faceless, relentless immoral military aggression
