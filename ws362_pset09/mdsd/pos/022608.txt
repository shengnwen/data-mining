Certainly a page turner and written in a style that is easily digested by the layman. I found it to be a bit "loose" in comparison to the Hot Zone. Towards the end of the book chapters on smallpox and anthrax are intertwined but leaves the reader with a great deal of dissatisfaction. 

Certainly any reader would like to explore this subject more thoroughly and there are plenty of unanswered questions that need to be answered and an updated book in a couple of years time would be appreciated
