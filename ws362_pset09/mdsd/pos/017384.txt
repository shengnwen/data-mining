I purchased this book when it first came out.  I thoroughly enjoyed it at that time, and have used it as a reference ever since.  What so many do not realize is that different treatments (distillation vs. tincture vs. absolute vs. hydrosol, etc.) of a plant result in often VERY different properties comprising that substance.  So finally having some insights into the properties of hydrosols, the water remaining from the distillation of a plant, is/was much needed.  No other work like it had been available.

And what a revelation about many of them.  Most people, even those working with essential oils and their cousins were not aware of what this or that hydrosol might do, let alone how to get their hands on it.

Really needed and really wonderful work
