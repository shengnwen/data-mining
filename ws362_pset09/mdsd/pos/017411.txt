I can't say enough good about this book, my favorite Lewis book so far. The chronicle of his gradual journey from ho-hum acceptance of religion, through varying shades of atheism, and finally towards an acceptance of Deity and Christianity, the book avoids cliche and thwarts expectations constantly. For instance, do not expect him to trudge through his atheist years as though they were all tortuous, empty experiences--Lewis introduces us to lively persons and wonderful places, and recounts his infectious delight in the scenic, classical literature and Norse mythology. Likewise, don't look for him to describe his tentative approach to God in grandiose, emotional ecstasies--on the contrary, he remains delightfully calm, rational, and clear-headed throughout, acknowledging the importance of grasping "joy" and God intuitively, but never abandoning his audience for religious excesses.

All in all, a tremendously rewarding experience, gratifying in many ways. Thank God for C.S. Lewis
