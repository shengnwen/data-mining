I'm a big fan of Bryan Peterson's books and I found this one very helpful.  His tips on how to see things differently and how to take shots from different angles and vantage points were great.  I think the best part about his books is that he shows examples of the same scene captured in different ways and it's alway clear to the reader which is the most compelling and interesting.  Plus, he always tells you exactly how he took the shot, what his camera settings were and other useful information that you can use right away.  I highly recommend this and Bryan's other books
