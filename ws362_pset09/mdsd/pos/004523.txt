I had this as a textbook for an Architectural Technology class as an  undergrad ARCH major.  Detailed with illustrations and photos of actual  ongoing construction projects, this book was very informative for showing  details and connections necessary to the making of a building.  While not  necessarily written for the layman, it would definitely be useful to anyone  wondering &quot;how you put it together.&quot;  There are moments when it  can become dry, but as I said, I used it as a textbook, therefore a lot of  my reading was REQUIRED.  It's not mandatory that one read this cover to  cover, but it would definitely be handy for examining processes and  checking details of wall sections
