This book was sort of like a kid's look into the world... where there are thieves and people who try to do illegal things to gain a profit. Some people learn, some people don't, and some people witness these things and know that's not who they want to be. 

That's what Jenna Boller does. She watches everything around her, and she learns from it. And when the time comes when she has to deal with it she knows she's not alone. This is such a good book.
