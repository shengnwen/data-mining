Clint Willis has created a fascinating series of books with Epic, Climb, High, Wild, Ice, Rough Water, and The War.  Each of these volumes presents the best literature about their respective subjects in a powerful cohesive manner.  These books are a quick read, but intricate and spellbinding.  I  have given many of them to friends and family as gifts
