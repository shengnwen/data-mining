I found the book depressing. I could not stay with it without seeking relief in lighter or more action packed stories. It  resembles  Ulysses in that it takes place in one day and is literate, though Ulysses is harder to follow than this book. I understand it's a classic and I'm glad I read it but there are other books I've enjoyed more and look back on more fondly. I don't understand why there are so many untranslated Spanish passages. It seems exclusionary
