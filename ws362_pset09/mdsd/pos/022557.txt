These volumes are a great testament in spiritual literature.  They expound on the mysteries of the universe and man--their nature and evolution.  All this gives rise to explaining how spiritual laws function.  She says in the preface that the truths contained in the volumes are the essence of all world religions; her job being one of rescuing these truths from "degradation."  Blavatsky was an early leader of the theosophist movement.  In this work, she goes stanza by stanza using the "occult" (spiritual) teachings of the book of Dzyan.  Of course, what makes these volumes come to life is her commentaries.  As one current spiritual writer has already noted, she was a prophet of the current trend toward the emerging spirituality which is lighting up our planet.  Well-travelled and well-connected with diversity, Blavatsky identifies the basic tenet of spiritual literature:  we are all one!  This is definitely for the intrepid.  Anyway, go HB!
