In a society where God is constantly under attack, this book helps put things in perspective.  It's a must for any Christian.  There are tons of wonderful quotes kids won't hear in the public schools.  It helps fill in a portion of history that is "taboo," the part involving God.  Our country's heretage is rich in divine intervention.  We love this book so much, that we have started a tradition of giving it as a gift to every graduate from which we receive an announcement.  I particularly like George Washington Carver's quotes for high school graduates
