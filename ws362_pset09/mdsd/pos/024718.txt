This is well written and informative book. One of the best things about it - is that the authors make a concerted effort to make their views and information understandable to the average person.  I am not an economist, and not much of an intellectual at all but this book grabbed me, like a steven king novel, and I stayed up all night reading.  Pretty amazing for a nonfiction book about economics! Like the afore mentioned novel, the book has a heartwrenching climax - and no clean and easy happy ending. (neither does King...) But how can you expect easy answers to complex problems?
