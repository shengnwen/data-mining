If you've ever wondered what your true talents (i.e. strengths) are, or wondered why you act and react as you do, this book is for you.  In my office, we use the book as a career development tool, and it enables us to help guide our staff in the direction that they are most talented, and therefore, most successful in the long-term.  It has helped improve morale and communication.  Additionally, this book helped me understand and appreciate myself on a new level, and it helped open doors of deeper understanding with my family.  I'd buy this book for a business or personal gift any day!  It's rewarding to have an understanding your strengths and then be able to act on them in a positive way
