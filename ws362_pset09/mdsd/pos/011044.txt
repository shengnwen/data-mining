It's true that this book can be a bit self-congratulatory, and at times the author is overconfident of his aim, partly because he's an outsider, drawing from and trying to make sense of his own limited experience as an idealistic northerner in a troubled southern town. Yet his perspective as an outsider is also the book's strong suit. Johnson's observations on two years spent teaching in the Greenville, Mississippi public schools are, on the whole, original, thoughtful, provocative and illuminating. He is also an excellent writer, which makes what could have been a drab academic treatise a thoroughly entertaining and memorable read. I'm sure Johnson has caught his share of flak from the people he wrote about, because the truth sometimes hurts, and any time someone tries to assess another person's life there will be errors and omissions. But Johnson clearly sympathizes with his subjects and his book provides an important service by opening a window onto a world that is unfortunately overlooked by most Americans.
