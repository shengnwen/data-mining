The Spirit Woman introduces us to a culture where oral history is paramount, and to a people to whom age and wisdom are highly respected.  Despite this, modern life continues to rear its ugly head, with Coel's honest portrayals of social problems such as alcoholism, academic dishonesty, and spousal abuse (particularly the latter).  The mystery of the location -- and even existence -- of Sacajawea's memoirs takes numerous turns, keeping the reader guessing throughout, with more than one surprising plot twist in the interim.  The novel concludes with a suitably powerful finale, leaving readers impatient to seek out past and future volumes in this growing series.  Though not truly a historical mystery, The Spirit Woman should prove of great interest to anyone interested in exploring America's Native American past and Sacajawea's story in particular.
