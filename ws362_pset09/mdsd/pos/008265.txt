THE BOROWITZ REPORT is perfect for anyone looking for a good, hearty bellylaugh (as the other reviewers point out) but I think it's a lot more than that.  After reading this book (and then buying four more copies for friends), I asked myself what separates Andy Borowitz's comedy from so many other purveyors of "satire" on the scene today.  I think it's this -- Borowitz blows away his targets in a way that is never mean but always hilarious.  He completely avoids the kind of partisan attacks that simply preach to the converted and instead reaches for the deeper truth.  And he never tells us what we already know and have heard too many times.  Somehow he manages to do this while making us scream with laughter.  Amazing.

I can't single out one column in this book that is my favorite, but it might be this one: CHENEY'S BRIEF APPEARANCE, RETURN TO SECURE LOCATION MAY MEAN SIX MORE WEEKS OF WINTER.  That is worth the entire $9.95 and then some
