Sterling NOrth has written a wonderful, touching, memorable book based on his childhood, and a raccoon named Rascal.  It is beautifully written, and is suitable for adults as well as children.  He describes each aspect of his childhood so well that you almost feel you are there.
If you are an adult who has never read this book, I hope you will not miss the opportunity.  If you have a child, don't let him or her miss this wonderful classic
