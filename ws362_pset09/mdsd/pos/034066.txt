Tony Evans does a marvelous job of explaining to men the pitfalls that we face day in, day out.  His writing is very down-to-earth, and he does a great job of making Scripture references come alive with his interpretations of Scripture in today's world.  I highly recommend this as a book for men's group discussions.  My accountability group has been using it for our discussions.  This is a very easy read
