This classic book on superconductivity is excellent for an experienced reader who has already some  background in superconductivity. However, for a student trying to learn superconductivity, it says too many things in too brief which may be difficult to follow. While teaching a course I would prefer to follow a book like Superconductivity by Ketterson and Song and refer to this book for selected (special) topics.
