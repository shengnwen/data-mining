Randy Alcorn has beautifully described Heaven in his novels; now he has thoroughly researched and brought forth explanations of Heaven in this non-fiction book.

Alcorn exhaustively writes about all topics related to God's Kingdom of Heaven.  This book is a comprehensive text relying on scriptures and other writers to give the full picture of Heaven to the readers.

The one downside of the book is that it does read much like a textbook on the subject but does have its share of stories to liven it up some.

Christians need to read this book or a similar book to gain an accurate idea of Heaven.  If Christians lived on earth in anticipation of the reality of Heaven, nobody could casually standby and remain apathetic toward the call of Christ to eternal life with him in paradise.  Alcorn produces a book to light that fire of hope and enthusiasm in readers.

I was struck by how often CS Lewis is quoted by Alcorn...almost literally on every other page.  Several other contemporary writers like John Elderidge and Philip Yancey do the same.  It is remarkable the influence Lewis has had on this book
