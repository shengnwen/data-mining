This book is well written and helps fetish collectors to understand the history behind fetishes as well as explaining the meanings of each &quot;animal&quot;.  The reader learns how to put these powerful pieces to good use for him/herself.  The information is usable for everyday life and today's society.  Even those without fetishes can gather useful information to assist in gaining control over one's thoughts, actions and meditations. Highly recommend this book to all
