Only thing noticed is that the book lacks some of the parts 
that are shown in the TV version movie.  My Granddaughter (age 5) noticed it right away.  
My personal opinion is that it probably can't be helped
in producing a movie out of a book.

The rest is very good and we've read it a few times already
