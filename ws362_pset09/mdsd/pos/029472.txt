Having been a sales mentor for 7 years, and having sold large solutions into the Enterprise for 23, this book has been exactly what I have been looking for. The need to quantify value in an easy, neutral fashion, and have your prospect do it with you, is exactly how the deals are being done today in this overheated, competitive technology market.

I have adapted my practice to ROI selling, brought it to my clients, and have found new clients because of it. One of the best elements of the book is the ability to engage with the author, and actually get his help. In several instances, I did this, and it was very competitive and highly professional.

I recommend this to vendors selling software and technology, CEO's who have to buy those solutions, and executives who need to sell there projects to their own C-level. With tools like ROI Selling, you can more easily advance your business and career. Great work!
