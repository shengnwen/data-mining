I began the school year by reading Ralph Fletcher's A Writer's Notebook aloud to my fourth grade class. This book details how writers get ideas through keeping a notebook-- a place to record and respond to events we observe in the world.  We have set up our own writer's notebooks and add to them each day after reading a chapter of Fletcher's book.  This is the first year my students are actually excited about writing!  One of the biggest hang-ups for my young writers is thinking of ideas about which to write.  Fletcher's book provides many &quot;seed ideas&quot; to get my students' brains churning.  Now, even my less motivated students look forward to writing time each day.  I even have students ASKING to take their writer's notebooks home to work on during their own time! Fletcher's book is a great motivator for young writers.  Its ideas are practical and easily applicable to the classroom.  I recommend it to any young writers, ages 8 and up
