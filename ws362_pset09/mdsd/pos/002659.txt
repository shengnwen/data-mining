I read this book when it first came out, and read it again, last month. 

The passion between the lines, in this wonderfully conceived and crafted book of both prose and poetry, had me totally possessed and engrossed in the multiple and simultaneous stories.

I like the aspect of the novel-within-a-novel, and how the stories of the past intertwine within the story of the present...in a magical and surreal fashion, at times.  This is the stuff that passion is made of, and Byatt has outdone herself in this masterpiece.

Possession was a book I became wrapped up in, within the literary creativity, the historical factors, and the beautiful fairy-tale poetry and prose.  The novel took me back to a time period I could visualize, and had my senses alert and eager to continue.

Possession, passion, poetry and prose, all combined in one artful and magnificent novel
