I use and recommend this book as a handy reference for letter writing. When I come upon an unusual situation it's a great place to start. There are so many letter templates available that I can usually find one I can modify to fit my needs. Some of my favorite letter templates are in the Chapters: "Responses to Owner Inquiries" and "Servicing the Listing." There are several "Response to Value Inquiry" letter templates I have found to be very helpful. Overall an excellent resource
