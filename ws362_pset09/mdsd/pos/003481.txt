This is a valuable study. Through interviews, it examines the background, motives, mission, inspiration, and organization of terrorists. How can they justify murder with religion and morality? Though it doesn't fully answer this contradiction (can anything?), Stern's book is a well written contribution to the subject.

Also worthy: Richard Rhodes, 'Why They Kill' (A study of murderers based on interviews); Robert Pape, 'Dying to Win' (the strategy of terrorism)
