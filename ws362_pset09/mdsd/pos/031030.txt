I am starting my collection of children's books for my son.  He is still a baby, but he loves to look at the big, interesting, and colorful pictures in this book.  It is nice because there are very short stories for times when baby is particularly wriggley and it is time for bed, and longer  stories for a growing attention span.  He just likes the pictures right  now.  He tries to touch the animals on the pages.  I like the fables  because they teach good morals.  This is one of those books that stays high  on the bookshelf and can be a treasure for generations
