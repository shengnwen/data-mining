	The novel Hush, written by Jacqueline Woodson, is about a family that finds themselves stuck in the middle of a literal life-changing problem.  When the father decides to make a colossal risk he notices that his family begins to fall apart.  In the process of reading this novel, I noticed that I could not tear myself away from the suspense.   Also, when my teacher Ms. Russo gave us occasional chapter quizzes my mind was filled with such excitement that I had words spilling out of my brain, and before I knew it my first response was taking up three quarters of the page.  In the beginning of the novel there was a song quote that read "hush little baby, don't say a word."  This quote was what I considered, the quote the book, since the family was basically living inside a secret.  The novel Hush is mostly appropriate for the children of all ages from sixth to eighth grade.  This is due to the maturity and need of understanding to read this novel.  Hush is a wonderful novel to read if you like suspense and action, due to many things always gong on in the Green/Thomas family.  So I advise you to grab a copy of Hush, and experience the thrill of an amazing, life-changing novel.
