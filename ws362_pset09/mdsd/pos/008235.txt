Being somewhat familiar with the Rastafari movement already and being somewhat fascinated by the culture I decided to read this book. The book starts out by tracing the history of slavery in Jamaica and outlining the conditions that precipitated a movement such as Rastafarianism which seeks a more equitable and just society. A decent amount is dedicated to Ethiopia and the idea of Ethiopianism where Rastafarians basically view this country in the same way as Zion is viewed by the Jews. Later elaboration explains mythical elements of the religion as well as the symbols, beliefs and rituals of the group such as smoking herb for a deeper understanding of a cosmic consciousness. I especially enjoyed the parts in the book where the author expounded upon the artistic improvements Rastas have made not only in Jamaica but the world over with things such as reggae music. Also kudos to him for talking about Bob Marley because he is a good reason the religion has gained popularity the world over. I won't give this book a 5 of 5 though because I did find the last chapter to be somewhat rambling and some of the ideas in the book are repeated a little bit too much for my taste. I think some people who aren't as interested in the movement as I am would have a little trouble keeping interested the whole way through. All-in-all though I think this is a pretty good read and does a good job explaining the basics of the Rastafarian beliefs and also gives detail about the socio-economic factors that contributed to this voice against colonialism and oppression
