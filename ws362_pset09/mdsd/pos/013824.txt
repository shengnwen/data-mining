How interesting it is to read some history on spirituals I've known all my life, but never understood the &quot;spirits&quot; they came from.  Ms. Warren has opened a door to me and showed me the true beauty of this music.  I am especially grateful to have the scores to each of the songs discussed in this book. I was also pleased to find the contemporary gospel section. This is not a sit down and read cover to cover kind of book, but a page flip to &quot;Oh, yeah, I know this song!&quot; kind of book
