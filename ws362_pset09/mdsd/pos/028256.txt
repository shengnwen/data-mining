Wow!!  This is definitely one of the best books that I have ever read.  I recommend it for everyone.  It will help Christians strengthen their faith and give non Christians an idea of what Christianity is all about.

The book tells the stories of about 100 different people who were persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ.  It is really challenging to those of us who live in countries where we have the freedom to speak openly about Jesus Christ.  It is not uncommon for Christians in other parts of the world to be beaten, tortured, or even killed because they believe in Jesus Christ.  This book really challenged me to get outside of my comfort zone and talk to my friends and neighbors about Christ.  It was also a great help because I no longer feel alone when I get ridculed or rejected because I am sharing my faith with people
