I am a longtime Jance fan and wasn't disappointed with Dead Wrong.  Any complaints would be the overemphasis on Joanna's pregnancy with a concomitant under-emphasis on tension and suspense (great ending, though!).  Butch is effectively out of the way in this installment as he promotes his book, but  also comes across as overly self-absorbed, especially when his obnoxious parents show up and his wife is poised to deliver their child.  Jenny, too has little to add to the story.  But Joanna shines, as usual. Nice to see such a reliable, ethical, and strong female protagonist
