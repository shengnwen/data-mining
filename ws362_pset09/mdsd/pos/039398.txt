A pleasant book about a great man who had the strength to hold to the convictions that he had been brought up with. One might also consider his predecessor - the opposite side of the 'John Paul Coin' - the liberal side - in Lucien Gregoire's PAUPER WHO WOULD BE POPE - The Revolutionary Life of John Paul I. Luciani (John Paul I) spent his lifetime defending the rights of women, the handicapped, homosexuals, orphans and the poor.  He is  often referred to as The Patron Saint of Orphans.   Two good men of two different backgrounds - John Paul II the conservative side of the coin and John Paul I the liberal side of the coin.
