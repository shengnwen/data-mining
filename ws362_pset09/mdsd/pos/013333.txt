This is the first Carol Kent book that I have read, but it will not be the last.  I loved it! It reminded me of how we can be an encourager to others and often we may not even realize it. Just by letting the love of Jesus shine through us to others.  How we can help lead others to Christ just by be being an example of a good christian friend.  This book is excellent, great for a women's book club read
