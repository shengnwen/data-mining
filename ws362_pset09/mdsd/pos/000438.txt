Like many inspiring, self-help books, Castro's contains myriad stories of "success" under fire. But to me, the most important point he makes is that we all face decision points in our lives. We can CHOOSE how we respond. A common thread ties together almost all of those briefly profiled in this book--they chose to act in an "heroic" manner. 

I was especially interested in Castro's first chapter where he laid out his thinking about the difference between what he defines as "heroes," and the rest of us. The secret, he asserts, lies with how they answer three questions: 1. What are you focusing on? 2. What do you believe? 3. What are you expecting.

As a life coach, I think these are excellent questions for anyone who wants to achieve anything outside of their comfort zone. In fact the entire first chapter of the book where Castro develops his thesis about why "heroes" make the choices they do, was informative and helpful. His Seven Laws of Critical Focus could be a roadmap for people who are looking for ways to help them meet challenges in their own lives.
