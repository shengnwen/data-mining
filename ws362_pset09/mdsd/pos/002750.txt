I had a 21 year history of allergies that was growing yearly - I was taking asthma medications daily, and I started to gain weight because any exercise initiated an asthma attack - so I started to become dormant.  Literally I was backing out of life.  Then I turned to allergy medications.  They may have been over the counter, and represented as harmless, but I was tired, forgetful, and lacked enthusiasm about work, and life.  So I started searching for alternative medicines.  I tried different therapies, but nothing got rid of the asthma.  Then I found this book, and read it.  It totally made sense.  But now I grappled with 'How am I going to do the actual program?'  

I finally decided that I was going to make it happen.  I had lost too much time becoming complacent, and drugging myself to live.  So I went to a centre, and did it.  It was difficult; there were lots of vitamins involved, and I didn't like sauna's (although I love them now) and it took me 28 days, as I had a history of X-Rays, Dental Work, Surgeries, sunburns/radiation exposure.  While I was on it, and afterwards though, the results were unbelievable. 

Today, 2 years after the program, I haven't gotten sick, I have never taken a drug for allergies, asthma, or any other purpose/reason, and I feel CLEAN.  And the best adjustment came naturally - I don't want to put anything into my body now that isn't good for it.  I have a clean body, and I'm going to keep it that way now.  

Isn't it worth taking a look at for yourself?  I am glad I did, and I hope you do too.
