I'm a big fan of Yancey's writing style and clarity, and I really enjoyed this work.  That said, if you're new to this author, I'd suggest starting with either The Jesus I Never Knew, or What's so Amazing about Grace (or perhaps one of his books that deal with the issues of pain).

If you're not new to Yancey, and are wondering what kind of book this is, here's my take:

It's not really a scholary look at the Old Testament, like who wrote what, when and why.  It's more of an over view of why the Old Testament is still important to us today, and how it relates directly to our Christianity.

Yancey tackles the questions of why life sometimes stinks and is seemingly unfair (an age old question asked in some of the oldest writings of men).

Yancey writes about how Jesus answers the nagging thoughts about whether or not an individual matters to God, questions that where asked over and over in the Old Testament, not only by individuals, but by the early Hebrews through the glory period of the Jewish nation on to the time of Christ when it seemed that Israel would be perhaps be destroyed forever as a nation.

If you are new to Christain books (or new to Christianity) I suggest reading the other Yancey books first, then if you feel, as I do, that he's a really wonderful writer, you'll naturally come back to this one.  I only gave this book less than five stars because I felt it was a bit too short, and just not quite as good as some of the others, not because I don't highly recommend it.
