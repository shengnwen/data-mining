This action-adventure fantasy takes place around Halloween in 1992 Los Angeles, a city full of ghosts and ghost predators. The action begins when 11-year-old Koot Hoomie Parganas (Kootie for short) rebels against his Mahatma-worshiping, vegetarian weirdo parents, breaks open their plaster bust of Dante, steals the glass vial inside and runs away.

Robbed and beaten up, he tries to go home but it's too late. He has set events in motion that have caused the murder of his parents and the convergence of forces drawn by the powerful ghost trapped in the vial - Thomas Edison.

Edison's ghost is a beacon, drawing rapacious "ghost-eaters" to hunt down Kootie, a bewildered boy who can't always tell his friends from his enemies. It also draws two other ghost-ridden people - Pete Sullivan, a man haunted by the drowning death of his father and hunted by an obsessed ghost eater, the film maker DeLarava, and Dr. Angelica Elizalde, a psychiatrist whose unconventional methods backfired on Halloween two years ago, killing several patients.

Powers sets these people on a collision course through a Lost Angeles so grittily, glitzily realized, you'll feel like you're walking its haunted streets in person. His eye for detail and the slight skewing of ordinary expectations heightens the atmospheric tension and creates an especially frightening world for the appealing and bewildered Kootie

Well-written, weirdly imaginative and fast-paced, the book's only fault is length. Long after most of the mysteries are solved, the protagonists are still running around barely escaping annihilation and it grows, unfortunately, repetitious. Powers redeems this minor fault, however, with a spectacular finale on the luxurious and history-loaded ship, the Queen Mary
