This book created some stir when originally published, perhaps due more to the naming of names (of peers Gardner judged arrogant/irresponsible/careless) than to the deeper ideas/passions which  inform it. One star is subtracted for poor strategy, excessive willingness  to engage on turf occupied/fortified by his not at all innocent victims.  Gardner does get lost, from time to time, in one abstract philosophical  swamp or another. The book may be needlessly long. But the writing rings  true, finally. This is the most ambitious literary argument published  during the past fifty years, certainly, and it is essentially on the mark.  The academic canon was tilting dangerously in the direction of empty opaque  diddling during the seventies, choked with very talented hip and superhip  cynics, often on university payrolls, weary of the ancient plain work of  shaping stories. The vogue was so universal that Gardner fails to find a  single working American high lit contender (excluding himself, we trust) to  like without heavy reservations. He does favor one Englishman, at least.  This ground is tricky. Some of the writing disdained/derided seeks, in  various ways, to imitate James Joyce, who is granted a semi-pass, and Ezra  Pound is not properly whapped until near the end. Connecting the wave of  mean arrogant cleverness to its obvious roots counts, has consequences.  Gardner, who died by motorcycle accident in the early eighties, may have  been just beginning to fight
