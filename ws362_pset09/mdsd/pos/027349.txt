If you like quality writing, this is it! Mr. Wolfe is extremely talented at painting an entire scene with words that leave you feeling like you are there. Character, scene, and plot development all have depth. And I'll have to disagree with an earlier review that said the characters weren't believable. They were entirely "human" with all the rich exceptions that make a person who he or she is. I also disagree with the comment that the book, itself, was racist. No, the book wasn't, but some of the characters were, which was a point that Mr. Wolfe was attempting to make about them because their racism had to do with the larger story. I will most definitely read Mr. Wolfe again because of his extraordinary writing abilities. That said, I was completely disappointed with the ending, both because of specifically how he chose to end it and because of its weakness. The ending lacked the full-bodied development that Mr. Wolfe gave to the rest of the story
