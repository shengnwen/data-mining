A great cut-and-dry introduction to epidemiology. Although I would prefer to see some of the mathematical justification, for the less interested it's a good start. Examples are plentiful and clear, although some topics are handled as asides which may break up the flow of reading.  Topics such as study design and measurements of association and occurence are clear-cut.  Issues such as causation and confounding were sparse - helpful to supplement with Rothman & Greenland's "Modern Epidemiology"
