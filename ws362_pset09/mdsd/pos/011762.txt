The book of Mr. Benny Shanon is an exploratory travel, something like Darwin or Humboldt discovering new landscapes and bringing back quantities of samples of unknown species. And beginning to shape a quite new theory of... life on the surface of the earth. Ayahuasca seems to be a continent. But the more exciting for me (as an artist) is the depth of the insight it gives on a faculty, the poetic power of the human mind, which is often misunderstood or described only in &quot;romantic&quot; terms. That &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;creating&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot; and &quot;loving&quot; are not necessarily separate activities, but are crossing their efficiencies, when our mind is at its higher (and also in its &quot;simpler&quot;) mode : that is the poetic mode of the mind. This book of Mr. Shanon is nothing less than the opening of a new &quot;library&quot; in the knowledge of this power and its ethics. Thanks. (Sorry for my bad english
