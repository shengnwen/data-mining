It's been awhile since I've read a true crime book and I was a little skeptical after first looking at the "shocking pictures" that were just family photos. But I was pulled in by the idea that a mother could do such things to a child for attention. This was the first I had ever heard of Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy.

I'm not a mother but it was hard to swallow that a mother would be capable and in the beginning I found myself flip flopping until the evidence was so glaring there was no denying it. I found myself thinking of this book in my sleep. 

It was sort of slow going until it was mentioned that a secret would be revealed at the trial. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what it could possibly be that was so far in her past, had she been abused? was she a victim of this very same abuse? Did she have more helpless victims? 

I think Gregg Olsen did a great job of laying out the framework and the evidence but I think he could have focused more on the Reids than the prosecutor. At times it made me think he may have been a little soft for her with all the attention she was given in the book.

Overall, I think this book is a good read.
