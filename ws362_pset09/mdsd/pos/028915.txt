A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years, writes this review.  My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry".  

This book is a nice addition to a cookbook collection for those are new to cooking egg dishes.

The book is subdivided as follows:
1.	Introduction:  Egg, freshness and storage
2.	Savory Omelettes
3.	Frittatas
4.	Souffles and Souffle Omelettess

The majority of the book is cooking of France and Italy, as the title implies.  There is however a few recipes from other ethnicities.

The directions for the recipes are well written and easy to follow, even for those that aren't too familiar with cooking egg dishes.  Her description of the traditional French omelette and how to prepare it properly, is thorough.  The author also does a nice job of covering rolled filled souffles.   Her section on the dessert souffles was my personal favorite.  I particularly enjoyed her recipe for "Coconut Souffle with Mango and Kiwi".

If you are new to cooking egg dishes, this is nice book to get you started to find out if you enjoy them.  However, if you are an old hand at the cooking omelettes and souffles, this may not have enough new material for you.
