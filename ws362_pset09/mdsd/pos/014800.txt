I very much enjoyed this book (until the ending) --- It was fast reading as I wanted to see what was going to happen to this poor little orphan girl

This book made me realize how something can be too good to be true (or someone) and how it is vital for one to use wisdom before embarking on major decisions

Hope others will enjoy it as much as I did
