This was bascially my course book on a NOLS mountaineering course I took. The basic skills needed for mountaineering we learned can be found in this book. It's great to have it around your house to look through just to keep  your skills fresh in your mind when you're not mountaineering. If you are  going into mountaineering don't think that just by reading this book you'll  be ready. Take a NOLS course. NOLS always produces high quality stuff
