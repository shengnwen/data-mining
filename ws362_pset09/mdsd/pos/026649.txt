Excellent book, a different look at marriage that deals with the psychology of love.  There are workshops through out the world that teach couples how to use the information taught in this book. I wish I would have found this book/CD years ago. Buy the CD and go for a long ride, It could change the way you love your partner and have you take a look at yourself
