A faithful WOT fan since The Eye of The World, I read Knife of Dreams over the weekend...a good time to read since the weather in New England was abysmal. I was extremely glad to see RJ regain the story telling ability he demonstrated in Books I - VI. Knife of Dreams is by far the best book since Lord of Chaos (Book VI) but it still doesn't rank with Books I - IV. Better yet, it concludes a few of the major plot-lines. Unfortunately, there are a goodly number of dangling plotlines that still need resolution. A tough job to do with only one more book in the series. Personally I think it will take two more books or a 1500 - 1700 page Book XII. 

Most of the major characters emerge in a better light (no pun intended). Egwene is interesting again. Mat becomes stronger as a character. The big problem was that Rand was almost nonexistent as was Aviendha and Min (my favorites). The Forsaken never got (and still don't) enough story time and RJ eliminated the most interesting of them (Lanfear) early in the series. 

For those who decry RJ's ability as a writer in the reviews I have read, I have only one thing to say: "Put your pen where your mouth is." You cannot truly appreciate the detailed (excruciatingly at times) world RJ has created until you have built one of your own. 

All-in-all Knife of Dreams is a good read (I give it 3.5 stars) and I highly recommend it...BUT only if you have read the first 10 Books. ;)
