'The Courageous Corgi' is a delightful story about Ramsey and his adventures from Wales to America.  I enjoyed reading about his trials, tribulations, heartbreak and joy that he endured and especially his mischieveous situations he & his brother would find themselves in after they both found each other and then their 'forever home'. I am also pleased that Ms. Herrick would share a portion of her proceeds with animal rescue organizations.
