Peter Guralnick comes over as a fan to the houses of the men he is going to interview. Sometimes an apartment, sometimes a house in Louisiana, but usually in their own homes. They watch tv, some books are on the shelves, a color tv, some records, a wife that also wants to add something.

In this manner you read the chapters about some great bluesmen. And they still remain legends and heroes, but legends and heroes that we can touch, that we can talk to, what we can see as normal men. And isn't that what blues is about? a music-style about and for normal men, who have trouble enough getting on in life?

This was Guralnicks first real book from 1971. The people he talks about were then mostly still alive and still performing. Also a good way to see them as they once were. 

Don't expect a comprehensive history, it's more a portrait. Another great Guralnick read
