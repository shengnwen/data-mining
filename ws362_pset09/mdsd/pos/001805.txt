Reading Frankenstein and thinking it would be like the movies in Hollywood is totally wrong. When reading Frankenstein in the beginning it is somewhat slow but turns gruesome. People get killed even in their innocents. The monster is truly evil, not nice. Middle of the book becomes interesting but you feel sorrow and some sympathy for the monster. In the end the monster himself reveals the complete truth of what he is. This may sound like a book report but feelings cannot capture the feeling that erupts inside during the novel.

If you look at the novel from a critique point of view it is a horror but still spellbinding. The story is not just simple and scary but helps you understand the nature of emotions and the beast inside our hearts. Love and wanting of acceptance is an emotion that is not understood easily but this book uncovers the secrecy on how one is wanting to be accepted in society. 

For the people who like books of horror but no meaning this book is okay. People who want a true classic but be mystified by a monster that is untaimable this is an excellent book. If you are looking for a sweet feminine or just a normal novel this might not fit you. This novel in my opinion is a true classic and you can tie it to todays world easily even though this was written over 100 years ago
