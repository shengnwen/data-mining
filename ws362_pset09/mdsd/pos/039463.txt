I stopped reading books of the Holocaust several years ago simply because the stories that come out of the Holocaust are heart-wrenching, bitter, courgaeous, guilt-ridden .... all of the emotions and thoughts that we human have produced can be a lot to digest at one time. 

I was at my parents' house when I saw this book lying on the coffee table. It was a book lent to my dad by his secretary's daughter, who just finished a course on the Holocaust and this was one of the required readings. I picked it up and from the preface, I was hooked by the author's precise and thoughtful wording. It is not an emotional book ~~ it is a book about survival. It is an observation of the "Lager," where Levi was held in. It was a clinical look as well ~~ it was his way of surviving and denying his humanness. It is definitely not an emotional rehashing of his time in the concentration camps, especially at Auschwitz, which is the worst of them all. I also get the feeling that he sometimes has an air of disbelief around him, like it's not really happening ~~ it's a nightmare that he never could wake up from. 

I would rate it a Five Star but I don't love this book. I thoroughly appreciate the discourse Levi has shared with us. It is a look from a survior who didn't color it with his emotions ~~ yes, it happened and this is what happened. It wasn't till the very end of this book where he described the ten days in the infirmary after the 20,000 "healthy" prisoners were marched into oblivion with the Germans, that he showed any emotion. It was then he allowed himself to be a man again, instead of a "Halfinge" ~~ a slave. He never put his survival to fate or to a higher being. He put it to luck. He was lucky to be sick at the right time. And he was.
