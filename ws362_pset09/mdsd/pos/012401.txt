I purchased this book in addition to How The U.S. Government Works, by the same author.  I was pleased that the books do not talk down to my middle-schoolers, but instead explain in easily-understood terms how it all is supposed to work.  This is a good reference book for a 'tween-ager.  I keep both books on my homeschool bookshelf and my children have gone back to them several times
