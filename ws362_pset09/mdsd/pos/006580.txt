It has always been a pleasure to read anything written by Carol Rushman. She explains well about every aspect and talks with lot of conviction. She doesn't miss out giving examples when needed. She explains right reasoning for an event with proper logic and great accuracy.

In chapter of Stationing and Retrograde Planets she writes "My daughter and I went to have our hair cut on the day Venus went retrograde and we both cried all the way home because we got such bad haircuts. We each had wanted a trim but we both went home with very short hair" She would not miss out making a note of minor or major event in her life.

Examples are very casual and yet not mundane but in line with what she is talking about.

I recommend this book to all who have deep interest in astrology.
