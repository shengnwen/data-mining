After looking through this book, I felt I found the ultimate bread baking guide.  Not only are there a ton of great recipes, but there are other tips, techniques, and problem solutions I've never found in any other book on bread baking.  My only complaint and it's a mild one at that, is the lack of pictures.  But then, I'm a picture person.  The directions could not be plainer even for the beginner.  I was so pleased with it, I sent a copy for my sister in Texas.  Patrick McGowan/Escondid
