This book covers the midlife stories of a large variety of women.  It has a number of interesting stories. None of the women really reminded me of myself, but then I'm a biochemist, an ecological economist and a patent attorney, which makes me pretty different from the typical woman.  I'm 43 and certainly hope there will be some changes ahead for me in the next ten or so years. This is a great book for getting yourself excited about trying something new.  

The author goes into considerable detail about her own midlife crisis.  I thought it was rather odd that she describes climbing mountains in an ATV as communing with nature.  As a hiker, I have an entirely different opinion of ATVs.  I hope that other women do not follow her example on this point.  

This book is very optimistic about what the future holds for women.  I hope she's right, but I would recommend pairing this book with Howard Kunstler's "The Long Emergency" for a contrary view.
