This is one of the most purely enjoyable books I have ever read, Zweig writes very well and at times brilliantly in creating characters both psychologically consistent and vivid. This is one of a rare type of novels that offers thrilling, page turning excitement combined with emotional and intellectual depth. Beware of Pity is not the most subtle, or beautiful book I have ever read but I can't tell you any other that was more of a pleasure to read
