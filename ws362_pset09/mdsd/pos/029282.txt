Prof. Kupchan has a very agreeable style. Most - not all - of his ideas are right. He claims the internet is bad for Democracy in the US. I claim the internet is good for Democracy on a global scale. The internet is positive for transatlantic relations. If this is the end of the American Era just as WW II was the end of the European Era could this be the beginning of the Global Era?! He owes me an answer..
