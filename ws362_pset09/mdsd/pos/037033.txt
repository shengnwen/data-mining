 Titles in the Dummies series range from very, very bad to very, very good. "Pay Per Click Search Engine Marketing for Dummies" is definitely very, very good. Peter Kent also wrote "Search Engine Optimization for Dummies" which is also very, very good and should be read before "Pay Per Click".

  "Pay Per Click" shows off Kent's talent for leading the reader step-by-step through some moderately complex territory. Kent writes in a clear and concise style, without a condescending attitude and, happily, without corny jokes. He walks through the concept of pay per click advertising, calculating ROI, selecting and bidding on keywords, creating landing pages (a very important concept), finding the right words for your ads (a very tricky) concept and then the pluses and minuses of the various services.

  Kent truly does cover the waterfront of pay per click advertising. If you're looking for a highly readable and information introduction to the subject, this is it.
