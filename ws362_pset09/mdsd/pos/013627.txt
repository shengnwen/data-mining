Unfamiliar with the author but very familiar with poker i was looking for a book with some strategy and stories from the felt.  This book has both.  Stories from the old days of poker and strategy used in even today's game.  An easy and joyable book to read.  A must have in any real poker players collection. Still trying to put it down!
