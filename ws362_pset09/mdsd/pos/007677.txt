Book Review-MOUSE TRACKS-The Story of Walt Disney Records by Tim Holllis and Greg Ehrbar

When I first started reading this book, it was very difficult putting it down for a second and in two days I read the whole book.  I was very hungry for information and stories behind those wonderful Disneyland/Vista Records I grew up on and have in my collection.  Tim and Greg went all out and did a great job to salute all of the artists, composers and people who have made Walt Disney Records the most successful music label for family entertainment.  Now, after reading this book, my appreciation  for my Disney LPs has grown stronger than ever.  

I won't give away any details because you have to read this book yourself but I will say that many of my favorite Disneyland albums are mentioned including the multi-platinum classic, MICKEY MOUSE DISCO, the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Best selling soundtrack of MARY POPPINS, those magnificent Storytellers and many more.  Also, read about the superstars of Disneyland Records: the narrators and singers such as Robie Lester, Lois Lane, Annette, Fess Parker, and so many other talented people and creative staff.

I strongly recommend this book to fans and collectors of Disney LPs such as myself and Disney fans worldwide.  It's an ultimate E-Ticket Ride for Disney Music!
