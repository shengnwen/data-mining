This novel breezes along and offers a lot of laughs, taking (as has has been noted) a cliched situation--a love triangle--and doing original work with it. Overall, whether with existential interludes, a character's quick analysis of motives, or an account of some consumer banality, the book is pretty comprehensive and insightful despite its relatively sketchy narration. Where the characters are concerned, opinions can be more divided. If the book falls under the category of tragicomedy, Elinor seems to lie closer to tragedy to comedy. I thought her story regarding her infertility issues, and her pain regarding her husband's adultery, makes this book rank near high-quality literature. Gina as the woman her husband adulterizes with is handled somewhat sketchily but is credible and is an interesting, and largely sympathetic, counterpoint to Elinor. Indeed, I thought she and Elinor together make up a sort of morality play regarding the divergent roles of women in American society. Where the book is flawed, I think, lies with Ted. As a doctor, he doesn't seem credible to me at all. He doesn't have the jaunty wit, or tendency to talk shop in random situations, that doctors so often have. As regards his marriage, he seems a doughy lump I can't very much sympathize with. Regarding his "paternal" relations with Gina's son Toby, he's much more admirable. But the book offers a lot for 200+ pages, so I think it earns four out of five stars
