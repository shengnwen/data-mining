It's a little bit pricey, but you get excellent overview of the field in Essa's book.

She strives for economy over quantity, so you get reviews of Piaget, Vygotsky, Erikson, Malsow, and the other names that influence early childhood in a concise but informative format.

It's a great companion after J.A. Brewer's, Feeny/Moracik's, and G.S. Morrison's introductory early childhood texts
