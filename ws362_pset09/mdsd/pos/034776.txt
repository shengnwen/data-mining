Hell on earth is how Kabul is described under the authoritarian Taliban rulers.  Two couples are intertwined in a collective battle for their existence.  It's a profoundly sad story to see a community so helpless under the onslaught of intolerance.  

You feel the women under their restrictive burka, you sense the fear of the men that are brutalized and abusive themselves.  In the end there are no answers, it's a disheartening novella to see that this sort of intolerance still exists.  Well written and sad to read
