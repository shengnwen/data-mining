The end of the Cold War at the beginning of the 1990s seemed to usher in a new era of hope, promise, and peace.  This book shows that the last expectation was wholly false.  The 1990s saw more American military interventions into other countries than any other decade of American history.  Haiti, Iraq, Mogadishu, Kosovo and Croatia are some of the numerous battlefronts on which American troops were sent to serve.  This book chronicles this decade, and shows how the US was inexplicably drawn into each of these conflicts one by one.  Key throughout most of these episodes was a Clinton administration that was reluctant to go to arms.  This book shows how many times it was pressure from the media, Congress, or the opposing party (Republicans) that convinced the Clinton administration that force was necessary.  In a way, this book resembles Halberstam's classic on the Vietnam War; the Best and the Brightest.  In both cases, a reluctant president was slowly but steadily cornered into committing troops.  This book highlights the major characters involved in the military excursion of the 1990s; Colin Powell, Tony Lake, Al Gore, Richard Holbrooke, Madeleine Albright, various UN officials and government officials of other countries.

All in all a great book.  This should be required reading for any course on modern American history, or modern world history.  I highly recommend it
