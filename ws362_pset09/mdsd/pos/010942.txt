Evans and Skinner present an 8x11 sized 'coffee-table book' containing letters purportedly from Jack the Ripper. The letters included are designated ones that were signed some form of JtR. The authors don't tell you they are faked or real but present them to you so you can analyze them for your own determination. There's no real way of telling if any of them were actually written by the Whitechapel murderer. The biggest bonus of this book is the fantastic photos of the letters; they are simply marvellous (5 stars). The book is worth the price for the photos alone. I found the 'discussion' of the letters dry and lacking of an actual analysis by the authors (3 stars). Also included are sample handwritings from a few Ripper suspects. Looking and comparing these were fascinating and there is quite a resemblence between the first 'Dear Boss' letter signed Jack the Ripper and a sample letter from William Bury; based on these, I'd be pretty suspicious of Bury (although that's not who I believe was the Ripper). Evans does a very good couple of chapters regarding the McCormick book about the Ripper and Dr. Dutton.

Overall, the text is okay for the first 2/3 of the book but then gets better on the McCormick/Dutton, suspects chapters. However, the photos are the real seller of this Jack the Ripper text
