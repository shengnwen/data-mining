David Gemmell, in In the Realm of the Wolf, writes another brilliant piece to the Drenai Saga. More history, more wonderful characters, and more action packed scenes bring the pages of this book alive. The magic might be subtle in Gemmell's books, but he includes just enough sorcery to quench the reader's thirst for a complete fantasy book.

Waylander the Slayer has not been the Slayer for quite a few years, but when a ruler feels he has a reason to fear for the life of his son and himself, Waylander finds that there is a wealth of gold on his head. With deadly assassins after Waylander and his daughter Miriel, he finds that the quiet life he has come to like will no longer be good enough.

Miriel, Gemmell's first strong female character, is the daughter of Waylander. She has been training hard under the tutelage of her father, but even his training cannot protect her from what is to come.

The unlikely band that Waylander and Miriel assemble will find themselves on a quest to help find the Uniter. Gemmell cannot keep up this astounding pace of unbelievable books in the Drenai series going. Or can he? Each book can stand alone, yet they connect with the other books in the series in so many ways. I am truly a fan of Gemmell and will continue to recommend him to every fantasy reader I come across. Enjoy
