This is a detailed book about the political machine Richard J. Daley built in Chicago.  In this book, you realize the corrupt nature of a political machine.  Votes were stolen, money squandered on people hooked into the machine, and the violence against those who opposed the policies.  It is a wonder that the machine is still somewhat working.  Machine politics is a nasty business.  Somehow regardless of all this, Richard Daley successfully managed the third largest city in the United States.  He improved the administration, built the infrastructure, and generally was not corrupt himself.  He was the head of the machine though and bears responsibility for the corruption.

This is an in depth expose of the Richard J. Daley machine.  It will take some time to read through the 400 plus pages of this political biography of Daley.  A good read for someone interested in Chicago
