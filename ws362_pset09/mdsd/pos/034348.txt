The 'Zohar'is one of the major Jewish mystical works. I have not really delved much in 'Jewish Mysticism' and am no expert on the subject. But from looking at the Translation and especially the Notes I have that sense that this is a first- class scholarly rendition of the work. The notes enable the reader to better understand what is by its very nature, a problematic, difficult, multiple-meaning text. 
This volume is the first in a long enterprise undertaken by Matt in which he hopes to translate and annotate  the whole of the 'Zohar'.
