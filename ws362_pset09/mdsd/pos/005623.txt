This book is a treasure trove of information for publishers and authors on the subject of promoting books. Not only does it give the reader specific steps and actions to take, but it provides excellent supporting information in the form of web addresses, names of organizations, people to contact, etc. This book stands head and shoulders above any other book I've read on the subject
