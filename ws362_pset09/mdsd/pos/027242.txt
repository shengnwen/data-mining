I came to this book as a complete beginner, and was pleasantly surprised.  Detailed, yet easy to understand.  Diagrams were excellent, clear and easy to follow.  Well illustrated with lots of pictures that actually served to  give you more ideas of things you could do that were variations on the  projects for which instructions were given.  I would recommend this to  anyone interested in learning how to do this.  Guess what my friends and  family will be getting for birthdays and christmas this year
