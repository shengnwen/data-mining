Clearly, the disparities in funding of public education for students in wealth and poor communities are disconcerting. Kozol evidences the conditions under which we educate poor and minority students with vivid and brutal anecdotes. For that reason alone, "Shame of the Nation" is a worthy read. However, I wish he spent more time investigating solutions. He hammers the point that the "white flight" of the middle class to the suburbs has left the poor and disenfranchised in the poor urban districts. He paints a vivid picture of schools that increasingly resemble factory production lines. But now what? He seems to hang his hat on racial integration. He argues that integration will fix all the ills, academic and social. He doesn't spend much time discussing past efforts at integration, such as busing. The trend continues unabated. Each time a new school is opened, the attendance zones become smaller and the homogeneity becomes more intense.Hopefully, writers like Kozol can keep the crisis on the front burner, and over time, we will be able to develop solutions. Somewhere, someone must have had some positive outcomes with low performing schools. I would like to hear more about those efforts
