I really began appreciating this book after attending an Ericksonian hypnotherapy workshop. The induction scripts are good examples of the different kinds of inductions and are usable as written. The metaphors (where the work gets done) are also very useful as is but as you get more experienced they make great bases for customized scripts. The chapter &quot;on doing hypnotherapy&quot; is one of the best introductions to the art I've seen. This is the one book I use regularly while doing therapy with clients
