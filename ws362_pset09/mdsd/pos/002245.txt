What an amazing book.  Somewhat difficult to read, you need a dictionary next to you.  But what amazing insights this man has not just into the world of Islam but religion as a whole.  I should clarify that the insights he has always existed in religious traditions, what is amazing is his ability to convey it clearly to the modern man.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  You will need a good understanding of Islam to really appreciate it.  Some of his insights has left me in awe.  Truly has changed my outlook towards things.  It's interesting to note that above all the religions he has studied and known intimately, he chose to accept Islam.
