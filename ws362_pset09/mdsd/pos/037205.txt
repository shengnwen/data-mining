As a Harvard-Divinity-School-trained professor of Biblical Literature, I am constantly amazed by Harris's detailed, precise, and cogent analysis of the Bible. Those misguided Christians who believe the Bible to be the literal word of God will find the text very threatening. But for those of us who believe in studying the Bible from an academic or scholarly perspective, one that is secular and nonsectarian, and one based on "scientific method," the text is thrilling. 

Engaging in an academic-scholarly-secular-scientific study of the Bible means that Harris views the Bible as a collection of written texts produced by the human imagination, within a historical, philosophical, and political context. Harris's study is admirably based primarily on the great European and American biblical scholarship of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (known as "higher criticism"), such as Wellhausen's "Documentary Hypothesis" and the great archeological and linguistic discoveries in the Near East. 

Anyone interested in learning about the Bible in an academic and secular way will be pleased by the way Harris assumes in general the superior accuracy of modern historic and scientific method (including the fact of evolution), compared to science and history as they are represented in the Bible. As such, anyone reading the text must be willing to maintain a scholarly and academic objectivity throughout; indeed, Harris tries his best to reject all supernatural claims made in the Bible itself, and find scientific/anthropological/sociological explanations instead. Modern science rejects the supernatural, and embraces only natural phenomena and proof. This means that anyone reading the text must be ready to suspend supernatural religious beliefs they may now hold, and agree to read an interpretation of the Bible that may be difficult or uncomfortable for them, especially fundamentalists, evangelicals, and others anti-rationalists
