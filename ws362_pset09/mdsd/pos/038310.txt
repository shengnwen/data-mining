The Gallagher series was the first experience I had with Nora Roberts.  She wove such a magical tale set in Ireland, and I actually felt that I was there with the characters in her stories.  

The story of Sean and Brenna was so great! Sean is just WOW.  Brenna is to be applauded for shooting for the stars and going after the man of her heart.  The chemistry was spectacular, and I think many of us women can understand harboring a longtime crush and finally taking the initiative.  Sometimes men just don't get it so we have to "get it" for them ;-)  Nora Roberts portrays all of the emotions to perfection!

You should definitely read this trilogy in order, it is actually one large tale woven into the three.  This book was number two, and I will say that books one and three were just a wonderful
