I recently finished a grueling semester, and after it, I've been needing some light reading to make me sane again. One recent rainy afternoon, I took a glance at my bookshelves and picked up The Thirty-Nine Stepts. It's been sitting there for a few years waiting for the right moment for me to read it. This was the moment, and the novel certainly did the trick. I quickly read The Thirty-Nine Steps that afternoon, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Richard Hannay is one heck of an adventure character. There aren't any lulls in the book with this character driving the plot. Richard has an extraordinary knack for getting into deep trouble and right back out of it. Even the few moments of the novel in which danger isn't directly overhead are entertaining because of Richard's (and Buchan's) sense of humor. The mystery of the novel isn't bad either. There's a really authentic sense in the story. Overall, there's not a dull moment in this brief book, and it was well worth the couple of dollars and couple of hours I spent on it. The book provided an excellent afternoon of reading, and when the next thunderstorm roles around, I expect to pick up one of Buchan's other novels that I have laying around.
