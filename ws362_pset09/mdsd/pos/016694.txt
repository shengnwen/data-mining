This is an excellent book. I have been self-teaching myself german for the past year or two, and this has helped a lot!
While this book is larger and may resember a medium sized cities phone book, the knoweldge it contains will outweigh any trouble that may be caused by carrying it around!

It tells you if it is a top 50 verbs, it also gives a bit of a grammar lesson for those that need a little brush up on what tense is! If you are learning german, by-pass the "white" books that have less verbs.
