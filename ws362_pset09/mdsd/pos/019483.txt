Firebirds Rising (edited by Sharyn November) is an anthology of original science fiction and fantasy. With stories from favorite authors like: Tamora Pierce (The huntress), Alison Goodman (The Real Thing), Diana Wynne Jones (I'll Give you my word), and Kara Dalkey (Hives). All of these stories are considered the best of science fiction and fantasy short stories.
Every story is intresting and keeps you reading on. With stories about telepathic alien, hybrid children (duck and human), and little people you can't get bored. You will enjoy at any time. I consider this book the way to get good fantasy and science fiction stories. Please read this book
