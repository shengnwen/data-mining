Disgusting, but genuinely funny, Alexander Portnoy is brilliant young Jewish man who just can't get enough, and what he does get never seems to do him any good.  Too much of the early part of this book deals with onanism (in all its sticky details) for this reviewers taste, but the parade of shikses (featuring girls with names like The Monkey and The Pumpkin) in the second half is pretty darn hysterical.  The fact that he realizes what a scumbag he is only highlights the absurdity of his situation: he's an assistant to the mayor of NYC for defense of the underprivileged, yet he's as sexually depraved as any figure in fiction.   He claims to hate Judaism and seems to hate Christianity even more, yet has the nerve to wonder why he's not happier than he is.  He blames his mother Sophie for most of his problems (which it seems are more emotional than practical) but ultimately aren't we all responsible for who we are?  A totally unlikable character, but his hilarious exploits are worth reading in themselves.  What a schmuck
