Once you pick it up how can you not love it?  I don't read trashy novels and found myself in Manhattan Cafe's with this book trying to hide the cover from the other customers!  I figured they would just think I was reading trash.  But it's not.

Valley of the Dolls takes you into the New York days of glamour and stars.  The likes of Monroe and Garlands and pills.  Three girls together starting careers in New York and just read as the insanity progresses.  I really love this book.  The line alone, "I need Dolls!" will never leave me.  Experience this book.  It's camp, nostalgic, and a fun read.
