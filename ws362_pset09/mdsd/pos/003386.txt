Electromagnetism is a hard subject for many people, including myself.  Schaums Outline of Electromagnetics, by Edminister, is an outstanding collection of problems and solutions more even when a companion in Electromagnetics using Mathcad, the leading technical calculation software.  The big advantage of the interactive Outline is its use of LiveMath.  You can change the starting parameters of a problem and watch as graphs are calculated in front your eyes.  

The student will find this is an exciting tool for exploring the universal laws governing electromagnetic waves and for gaining intuition about how various parameters affect the solution to problems.  

Finally, I am sure that the educator in physics and engineering will find a comprehensive selection of laboratory and homework exercises in Mathcad, with plenty of room for creativity and expansion.
