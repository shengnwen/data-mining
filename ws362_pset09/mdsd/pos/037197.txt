First off, I haven't finished reading this book, but there are a few errors that I feel the need to point out.  

First--I sat with my copy of Drawing of the Three and could not find the man in black disappearing into any doorway--perhaps this happens in one of the later books.  If so, a footnote to that fact would have been nice.  

Secondly--The author of this work neglects to mention obvious connections between the Dark Tower books and other works of literature.  A discussion of Eliot's The Waste Land would have been interesting and possibly invaluable, especially considering both King and Eliot use Tarot cards and play fast and loose with Aurthurian legend. At least a mention of the fact that Rhea of Coos is the witch of coos as a nod to the Robert Frost poem of the same name should have been in order.  

All this being said, I have appreciated the author's attempt to bring all of King's writings regarding the Dark Tower together... an inspired work.  

Overall, A few quibbles that only an English professor would complain about...
