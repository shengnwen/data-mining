This book was about a boy named Sterling North.Sterling North is also the author of this book.This book was about Sterling finding a raccoon in May.He names the raccoon Rascal.They became very good friends.It was kind of sad at the end though.At the end, Sterling lets Rascal free. Thats what made me sad. I recommend this book four stars
