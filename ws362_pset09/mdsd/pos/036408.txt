I was planning a photo trip to utah and so collected a large number of books on the area. I would rate this book as one of the best and most useful. It gives very handy hints on planning your trip. Most guides have so much info you can't wade through it all. This Moon guide assumes you have only a limited amount of time and helps you make decisions appropriatley. Highly recommended
