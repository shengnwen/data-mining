My first Vince Flynn... and I wasted no time following it up by reading his "Memorial Day" and "Transfer of Power."  I like his style.  He maintains momentum.  Yes, he's not the most eloquent writer, but that's not the focus of his work.  I believe he's more concerned with plot movement, and I find his books simply fun.  He keeps everything clipping right along.  Are all the plot twists plausible?  Who would ever know, except CIA, FBI and Secret Service insiders -- and I certainly am not one.  I suspect that not all the events are plausible -- particularly the scene toward the end of "Term Limits" wherein the former Navy SEAL fellow commits murder right under their noses.  But it's still a fun, page-turnin' read
