No one book was able to satisfy my research needs, and I ended up writing a two page memo that combined description with prescription in drawing out the best information across all three books (copy posted to OSS.Net Library under Reference). I deeply regret that I did know look into this ten years ago--both men and women need to understand this stuff before they hit 40. A great deal of emotional misunderstanding could be avoiding if *both* men and women absorbed this knowledge early on. Of the three books, this is the middle one in terms of utility and ease of use. The other two books that I recommend are Colette Bouchez, "Your Perfectly Pampered Menopause" (2005, the most time-consuming to read, but also the most up to date with some real gems of knowledge), and "The Menopause Survival Guide" which is the shortest and also the best starting point.
