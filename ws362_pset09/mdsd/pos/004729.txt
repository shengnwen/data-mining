Kitchen Confidential is a memoir of Anthony Bourdain's experiences in his career as a chef and his climb to the top.  The book is written in a very street type of a language so it flows as if you are listening to him tell his story rather then reading an authors words.  His stories are a bit brash and he writes using a lot of curse words but he is a man of the people and writes  using the peoples language.  He really conveys throughout his writings that cooking at his level is not an art, its a craft.  Just like a carpenter can build a house he can build a meal.  His crafts were honed through repetition and apprentiship.  I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in cooking, eating or just reading an interesting story based on a cooking celebrities life
