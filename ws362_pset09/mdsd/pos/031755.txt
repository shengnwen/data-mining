The argument that there is a link between economic prosperity and moral behavior is the central thesis of the work. The more prosperous societies are shown to be those most generous and compassionate, those least- conflict ridden.
In a sense this is an extension of the old Puritan idea of chosenness by hard work and success. The successful on earth are taken to be those chosen by God for blessedness.
Now it is the successful society as a whole which is able to use its largesse to be morally beneficial.
This thesis, however broad, is backed up by a lot of empirical data. Even among the primates it is those living in lush tropical areas such as the gibbons who are taken to be most friendly and generous to each other.
Scarcity brings out the worst in us, the tooth- and- nail struggling for each little advantage.
Except that there are exceptions, very great exceptions. And as great power corrupts great wealth often too corrupts, not only for individuals and families but for societies' also. One can say read the story of the birth- dearth in the West, and what Christopher Lasch called 'the culture of narcissism' as coming directly out of the temptations given by abundance of wealth. And one can trace many family breakdown scenarios to the kind of seeming freedom from responsibility given by great wealth. There are after all those who maintain that the present day United States , conceivably the wealthiest society that has ever existed, is filled with corruption and moral failure.
