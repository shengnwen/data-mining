Maybe this book does not contain so many &quot;hits&quot; as others, but  it is still a good old Gary Larson Classic. I am a huge fan of his work and  I think it is worth buying and reading. Among other things to find out,  what REALLY happened with Dorothy and co., when they enetered the yellow  road
