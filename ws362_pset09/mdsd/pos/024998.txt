So much depends on this selection of WCW's work... it seems to me better than the other selection in my possession, the Penguin edition from the 80s. This one is beautifully designed and sized. I'm not familiar enough with the entire opus to really know whether this selection is definitive; certainly none of my favourites are absent. Small quibbles: something about the type makes poems sharing a page look like uneasy bedfellows but I don't know if this is avoidable. Also the glue inside the front flypaper is visible and I'm not sure will stand the test of time as well as the poems have. Overall though, a very pleasing volume
