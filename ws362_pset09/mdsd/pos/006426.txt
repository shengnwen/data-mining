This is truly a complete Bible for the Gnostics. It contains every major writing that is considered Gnostic. It includes both and Ancient and Medieval writings. The writings are gathered from all religions branches of Gnostics Pagan,Jewish,Christian,Mandaen,Manichaen,Islamic and Cathar.

With in this volume we have early wisdom Gospels such as Thomas and even the biblical John, there is Sethian,Valentian,Syrian,and Hermetic Literature.

This is a great volume to use in referencing the original works as you read about them. I read this entire volume through from front to back when I had just began studing Gnosticism and had a hard time comprehending it.Some of the writings are hard to understand with out a full understanding of what the writer was trying to teach. For example the book Thunder teaches nondualism but makes no sense with out this understanding.While I believe the Gospels of Philip and Thomas are very easy to understand.This volume contains almost the entire Nag Hammadi text and so many other tests it is like one time shopping for all the texts you will need in your studies. If you are interested in Gnosticism this "Bible" should be in your reference library.
