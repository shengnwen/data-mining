The book is certainly an excellent source of knowledge about a unique facet of the transatlantic slave trade that is frequently overlooked and marginalized.   This account, describing the lives of dozens of African Muslims in North America and elsewhere in the New World should serve as a catalyst for further study into the roots of the Muslim American experience.  The less than perfect score is due less to the author's compilation, and more to the dearth of extant sources available for analysis.  A more in depth study into the lives of existing Muslim communities in places like British Guyana and in Trinidad would likely yield a more comprehensive picture.  The account is excellent, but it is by no means definitive, and much research remains to be conducted and codified.
