I bought all twenty of the hardbacks, and spent a few weeks ignoring everything else in my life. I was so absorbed by this series. It is fantastic. I'm sorry it came to an end. I bought the eleven books of Horatio Hornblower which I'm reading now. While it is enjoyable, they don't match up against Captain Jack and Dr. Maturin
