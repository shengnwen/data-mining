Santa brought this book to go with a train table for my 3-year old this Christmas.  He made us stop to read it to him TWICE while we were opening presents. On the day after Christmas, he was chanting "I think I can...I thought I could..." all over the house.  He just loves the illustrations because they show the differing personalities of the various trains so vividly
