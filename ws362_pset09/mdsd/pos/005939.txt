This is not an easy book. It is striking and memorable. If you read it more for the immediate effect of the imagery rather than try to figure out a plot or the characters, it is much more rewarding. I'm not knowledgeable  about the model of Fire Island society but that is secondary anyway. If you  are looking for a real page-turner, this book is not for you. If you read  slowly and visualize what the author describes, you will be amply  rewarded.This book may be about life on a beach but it is not a &quot;beach  book.&quot
