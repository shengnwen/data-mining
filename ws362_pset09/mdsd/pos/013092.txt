I have been a loyal follower of Wayne Dyer for over 25 years and subscribe to his philosophy of life.  This is the first CD I've purchased and I use it for my daily walks.  
Some of the material is repetitive but he builds on old ideas and introduces some new concepts.  As always, I find Dyer a gentle teacher who uses ancient ways with modern application.  Not in your face or too intellectual, Dyer promotes self esteem, takes the judgement out the desire to suceed and acquire money, and provides simple steps for a busy schedule.  
I find that even if I don't follow all the steps to the detail, just applying some of the suggestions improves my life.  
Certainly worth the $15
