One of the main characters in the show corrects Sarah, the main character, and says that he prefers to be called part of people of color and not a minority.  Standing from a black male at the same age range as the character I think this is not accurately presenting our generation.  We are not as dramatically pressed on whether we are called certain things or not and that's a huge component of the book.  I do not mind at all being called a minority because...well...we're not a majority, so what does that make us?  A minority!  And I'm not the only one who believes this, I think a MAJORITY believes that it doesn't matter unless you don't use racial slurs.  She touches upon a good point that minorities don't like to be stereotyped but some theories that Rebecca Gilman brings up I do not agree with.  I'm glad however that the show has drive and has certain points that it is determined to make, even if I don't agree with those points
