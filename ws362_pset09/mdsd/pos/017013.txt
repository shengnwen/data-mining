"It Could Happen to You" somehow manages to veer between being hysterically funny and loving and poignant without ever losing the very real, human voice of its narrator.  Because of its breezy accessible style (think "Tales of the City", only in the first person prenatal) it would be easy to overlook the more profound themes beneath the fun stories.  In the end, "It Could Happen to You" isn't "only" about the making and having and growing of a baby; it's about the emergence of a woman, the narrator Martha, as a wife, mother, writer, and individual.  And it's a hoot to read, too
