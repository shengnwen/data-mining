I am by no means a good striper fisherman, but man do I love to fish for them! This book is humorous and well written, a great little story about all the different characters who pursue this mighty fish. I especially loved the part about "skishing!" it's laugh out loud funny! Thanks Mr. DiBenedetto for a great story
