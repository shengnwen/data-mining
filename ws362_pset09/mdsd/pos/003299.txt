This has become one of my favorite Grisham books (it ranks up there with The Firm and The Client).  I love the topic being the cigarette industry and coming from Richmond, VA (home of Philip Morris which seems to be like the company mentioned in the book), it was that much more intriguing.  Thrown in there are the usual Grisham-like bad guys.  The hero, though, is not a lawyer, but a jury member, Nicholas Easter, with a knack for persuasion.  With his girlfriend, Marlee, they are working to singlehandledly take down the cigarette industry.  Sound impossible?  Maybe, but considering all the legal issues that the cigarette industry has had over the years, it seems believable that there could be one case that would decide the precedent for future lawsuits.  The bad guy, Rankin Fitch, is perfectly evil and will do what he can to make sure that the tobacco industry is protected.  Some highlights in this book include humor, likable minor characters, and fast-paced suspense that makes you want to keep reading and reading.  While I did not see the movie and heard that it is not about the cigarette industry (but gun manufacturers instead - typical HOLLYWOOD!), I recommend that you read the book instead.  You will not be disappointed
