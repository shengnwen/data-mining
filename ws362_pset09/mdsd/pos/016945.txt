The Italian author Umberto Eco has written several humorous articles in his career. This book is acollection of the classics. All articles are at least mildly entertaining, containing some all-too-true comments of the modern society, and a few even managed to put a smile on my face. It is a quick and fun read with pointed social criticicm and irony-filled sarcasm. A nice little gift idea
