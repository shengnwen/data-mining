This book originally came out back in the fifties, a little before I was born. Mao had not taken China yet so "old" China still had a stong flavor and culture of Taoism and Buddhism. Watts takes us through his impressions of why this China was uniquely qualified to give Zen to the world and how Japan could render it to its present form. While old in style the presentation is timeless. The history and trends that make Zen what it is are laid out for all of us to understand. The second half of the book is particularly helpful for understanding what Zen is. The first half is more or less history. For those who love the art that was inspired by Zen, the last few chapters are wonderful. Taken for what it is, this book has more useful and concise information that most other Zen sources for we western types
