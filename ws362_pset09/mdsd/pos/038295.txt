This was my 5th CLEP and it was the toughest of them all. (Sociology, Marketing, Management, and Macroeconomics were the others). That being said, this guide is all you really need to pass. If you want to get say over a 70 then you should probably supplement it with other materials, but if just passing is good enough for you, then this is your book. I studied it for 9 days, took both tests, and pulled a 61. Good enough for me
