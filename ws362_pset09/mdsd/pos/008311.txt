"What Evolution Is" by Ernst Mayr is a great introduction to evolutionary biology for the educated layperson.  It begins by flatly denying Creationism and gives readers a bibliography in order for him or her to do more research on that front.  The book then discusses Darwin and some other evolutionary theories that preceded him.  Mayr then goes on to explain topics such as genetics, speciation, natural selection, and finally, human evolution.  The book does get technical in parts but this is a technical book; this is science.  One weakness is that Mayr occaisonally talks about a concept or a term and then defines it in the next chapter, as if expecting the reader to know what it is (although the glossary is good and there is always the dictionary.)  I think another reviewer mentioned this as well.  Overall, though, I would definitely recommend this book to the educated layperson who wants to learn more about evolutionary biology.  I would look elsewhere, though, if one is looking for information about human evolution, for this is not the author's purview, but he does outline the subject for the sake of continuity; the reader should look elsewhere for information about paleoanthropology.  The author does rely a lot on his own research, but that's to be expected because the author was on the forefront of the "Darwinian synthesis" in the 1940s.  He has a lot to win or lose on the whole thing.  There is an excellent bibliography in the back, as well, and I look forward to researching more on the subject and also reading more of Dr. Mayr's work in the future
