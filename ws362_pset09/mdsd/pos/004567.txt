Back in flashy, sexually-hedonistic 1970's California, when Armistead Maupin was serially writing the stories that would later become the book Tales of the City, San Francisco residents read these chapter-size installments in the local press, and to them it was like following the lives of people out there somewhere in their city, in their world, in their time. Today, thirty years later, reading Tales of the City, is more about making a trip backwards to another era: an anything-goes era extremely different in attitudes and mores from the reactionary conservatism of our own. The open promiscuity, the drug use, the amorality and experimentation that temporarily re-set life's rules might surprise many born after the `70's, who grew up in more staid years than those which Maupin uses for his canvas. This book is filled with larger-than-life characters whose exploits fascinate perhaps even more now than they did in that other age. This book is funny, touching, slightly repellent in a few places and endearing in even more. Its stories of the unique migrations to San Francisco of the spiritually-seeking and the sexually-unbound reveal some of what made that world-famous city so unique. I think this evocative book will become a classic and be read long into the future for use as a roadmap back to a time and place destined to become as (in)famous as Paris in Fitzgerald's 1920's
