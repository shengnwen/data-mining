 An extravagant sequel to Hailey Abbots original Summer Boys. This sequel takes place where the original did, Pebble Beach. It has the girls from the first summer excluding Jamie who goes off to a writing course for the summer and including Kelsi whose boyfriend broke her heart last summer. Beth this summer is trying to survive being without George, her wonderfully sweet and funny boyfriend who has to stay home for the summer and work while Beth goes to the beach. Ella who is trying so hard to give up her wild ways and become a one-man woman. And Kelsi, who had her heart broken last year, is trying to find love. During this summer secrets will be reviled that could either make or break relationships and in the end the reader will be satisfied...I think this book is better than the first.
