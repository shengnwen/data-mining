This book is no joke. It is really freaky and extremely possible. Espsecially in thes day and age it makes you think about what could be going on at anytime.

This book gave Bill Clinton the jitters so much that he had people find how possible the situation could be.

The kind of detail that Preston goes into is amazing. He talks about exactly how the people die and what is found during autopsies. It also goes into detail about what is going through people's minds at the time of the outbreak.

It is definitely a great thriller. The book is very serious in its moral and tone. It is meant to teach the public about the true safety of your life and how easily any sense of security could slip away
