The follow up to the Peter Pan prequel "Peter and the Starcatchers" is a hefty book that may scare some of the more timid readers among us.  556 pages seems like a lot, but there's a lot of action that keeps the pages turning, and I finished it a lot faster than I thought I would.

If you're scared of the dark and tend to jump at shadows this may not be the ideal book for you, because even though it's not scary, it has a lot of dark content.  Peter Pan sets off on a rescue mission to London to warn Molly about a sinister plan to seize the trunk of starstuff in her father's care, and takes some big hits to his ego when Tinkerbell has to bail him out of trouble over and over again.  

While he's off saving the world, Captain Hook has plans for the Lost Boys on Neverland, and even Fighting Prawn can't help them when the trap is sprung. Oliver Twist meets Stonehenge, and mind control meshes with inter-terrestrial beams of light in this action/fantasy story that builds to a climax, and then ends with a wonderfully mighty splat.
