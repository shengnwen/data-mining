This is an amazing book.  The evidence is so solid and the story so well told that I have no doubt about the authors conclusion that Middle Eastern terrorists were involved in the Federal Building Bombing.  Every American (if you care about this country) should read this book.  Jayna Davis is a brave woman to have gotten to the bottom of this story.  Every American should demand justice for the victims in this terrorist act.
Thank you Jayna for your great work
