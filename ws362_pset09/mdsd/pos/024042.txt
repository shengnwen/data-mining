Having read the other books that tell you to cut up your credit cards, what a breath of fresh air this book was in that it showed how to get out of debt quickly and keep my credit cards at the same time.


After a divorce I was left with huge debts. My spouse charged the heck out of our joint cards and left me with the tab. her idea of a joint account was she spent it and I pay for it. Thanks to Robt. Kiyosaki, I was able to 86 all of those debts and in record time.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get out of debt the most effective way.
