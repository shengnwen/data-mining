What a lovely book! On returning from my first trip to Israel not long ago, friends and colleagues were stunned at how totally I -- a liberal secular non-Jew -- had fallen for Israel, and especially for the Israeli people. No doubt I sounded goofily infatuated trying to explain the resilience, toughness, crusty directness, the kindness, the wit, the incredible Israeli smile -- see, there I go again.

Well, they're each getting this book for the next birthday, because Donna Rosenthal so entertainingly illustrates and elaborates all that I was trying to get across, and more.  She shines a gentle but penetrating light on the contemporary Israeli culture and people from inside out. 

This is a wonderfully written book, intricately but smoothly woven from anecdotes, interviews, vignettes, histories, and possible futures; it is a pleasure to read. Most highly recommended
