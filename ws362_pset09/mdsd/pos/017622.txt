I have to say the I'm ONLY on chapter 4 and already am I cought up in this well written novel. I have read "The Innocent" and "Promise Me", but this one has me engulfed that I can not put it down. I just purchased it last night from Barnes and Noble (which was near closing time), reading parts of the story just standing there it grabbed my full interest. If it wasn't for WORK I'd probably be half done if not completely finished by now. I love the feel of this story it draws you in and you just have to know what's going to happen next. I can't wait to finish, it has my full attention. Even at this point I do recommend "The Woods" Harlan Coban has a way with words, his imagination is like watching a tv series..he makes you feel like your part of the novel..everything seems comfortable with the flow of his stories..he is soaring, and GOD has truly blessed him with the gift of tale
