As a psychologist wanting my clients to be educated on the biochemistry of depression and possible solutions, I have found this to be the best of all the alternatives I have read.  It discusses all the treatments rather than focusing on one alone, as many books do.  It is well written, easy to understand, and treats the reader as if he or she is intelligent enough to grasp a good deal of information.  I think this book would help everyone in therapy, and would also help therapists in their attempts to help.
