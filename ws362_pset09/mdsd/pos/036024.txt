Those who have criticized this book thus far here are women who derive their sole identity and sense of importance, sadly, from their role as mothers.  I know women who thoroughly enjoy being mothers, but they are few and their circumstances are unique.  And even some of them still have a clear need to have another identity and a life of the mind they aren't permitted within the &quot;institution&quot; of motherhood.  I myself, and most other white, middle-class mothers I know, struggle with the impossible expectations placed upon us to be perfect mothers/providers/etc., struggle to create a new and healthy understanding of motherhood, struggle to do right by our children and yet hold on to our own personhood, thinking, humor,... finding ourselves too often overcome with self-hatred, resentment and guilt, knowing inside that no matter what, someone will criticize us for doing it all wrong.  This book exposes this unfair situation in which MOST of the women who are mothers find themselves in and if to some Rich comes off as &quot;angry,&quot; well...could we ever be angry enough for the history of this suffering which lives on today?  My only criticism of this book is the lack of attention it gives to the experiences of women of color and working-class women
