In this book, text and detailed drawings follow the planning and construction of a "typical" castle and adjoining town in thirteenth-century Wales.  Macaulay recently added the title "Mosque" to his series of large constructions such as "Castle" or "Pyramid".  It is nice to see the man being so prolific.  This book would appeal to the child who likes to know exactly how things are created.  Going step by step, Macaulay explains each leg in the process of creating a castle.  More importantly, with each construction the author goes even further, explaining the purpose of that piece.  The reader never looses sight of the fact that castles were both antagonistic and defensive.  Children today that have seen the Lord of the Rings movies might be very interested in knowing more about the construction of these structures and how difficult they were to defeat.  Macaulay's drawings are just as interesting as his text.  Pencil drawings label and list every tool, brick, and worker.  Undoubtedly, this is not a book for everyone and it would not be much use beyond serving as a reference guide for interested students.  However, should a teacher wish to bring it up, they might wish to show the video Macaulay narrated of this book.  Also, it might go well with Avi's "Crispin: The Cross of Lead", as a look at a castle from a peasant's point of view
