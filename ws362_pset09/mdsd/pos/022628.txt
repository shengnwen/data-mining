About a year ago I read "Black House" and thoroughly enjoyed it. I immediately knew I wanted to read "The Talisman", a book about the young Jack Sawyer and his early adventures in the Territories. However, there are always books I want to read and it took me until now to get to it. I must say that I did not find this book to be all that compelling in the beginning, but around the time Wolf made his appearance in the narrative I started getting hooked.

"The Talisman" is the story of a quest. 12 year old Jack Sawyer must find and claim the Talisman to save not only the life of his mother, but the life of her "Twinner", who is the queen of an alternate world called the Territories. But more than the lives of these two women is at stake. Jack must defeat the evil forces that are corrupting both worlds, and possibly even worlds beyond these worlds. King and Straub have done an excellent job of creating a believable alternate world and filling the book with memorable characters, both good and evil.

Above all "The Talisman" is a book about love, friendship, loyalty and bravery with characters you will never forget
