Now here's the book you want if you're serious about firearms construction. Well-written, factory grade drawings, and an attractive weapon to build! Then why did I give it &quot;only&quot; four stars? Here's why. The magazine used with this weapon is the standard Sten SMG magazine. And every soul knows that the weak part of the Sten was....exactly, the magazine. So you better think of something else than using dodgy surplus WW2 rejects when you commence the construction of this impressive piece of weaponry. Anyway, great book, I love it
