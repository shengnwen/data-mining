Let the buyer (Investor) beware!  This is an outstanding work of what really happens behind the curtain at Wall Street. This should be required reading for ANYONE thinking of investing any of their money on Wall St. Before choosing a mutual fund, making changes to your 401K, or selecting a stock.  Not since Michael Lewis' Liars Poker has there been such an open treatise of just how treacherous business really is on Wall St. So even if you already concede to the fact that you know your stockbroker will screw you, beware not only is he screwing you but they just came up with 3 new ways you did not even think of to screw you again and again.

This book goes well beyond the high-tech bubble, it speaks directly back to the I-would-recommend-any stock you like as long as you buy it mentality.  This is a very thorough piece of work and should be required reading for all investors. What occurred is nothing less than fraud.
