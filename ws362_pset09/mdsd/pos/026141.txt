It is easy to see why this book, Sam, Bangs, &amp; Moonshine, written and illustrated by Evaline Ness, is a winner of the Caldecott Medal.  The illustrations correspond well to the content of the story.  The story takes place on a small island where Sam, the main character, whose full name is  Samantha, lives with her father.  Her father is a fisherman.  The  illustrations show Sam to be a lovable young girl, whom readers will adore.   Her father shown as a stern but lovable figure.  The illustrations and  text complement each other to make each character spring to life, even the  wise old cat, Bangs. The illustrations transmit the feeling of the island  harbor environment; raw and rough, one can almost sense the saltwater air  through the pictures.  They help to set the mood of the story, as well as  bring the setting to life.  It is rare to see such illustrations that tell  the story almost better than the text itself, but together the text and  illustrations are in perfect harmony. 	Sam is a mischievous young girl  who has trouble telling what is "moonshine" and what is "real."  The plot  will appeal to children who also sometimes have trouble telling the  difference between the real world, and the world of their own imaginations.   Parents will find this to be a helpful book in dealing with children who  need help with the concept of truth.  Readers of all ages will find  themselves worrying along with Sam, as I did, about the consequences of her  "moonshine," and will sympathize with her plight.  This is a delightful  book with a good message, it is important to tell the truth
