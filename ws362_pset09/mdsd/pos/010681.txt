This is a wonderfully evocative book of the times of Moses the man.  It parallels the awesome &quot;THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; by Richard Patton.   Both these books create a reality around the historical figures that is sadly lacking in the traditional texts.   Both these books are rich food for thought and highly recommended
