Finally!  Depression explained in a manner which makes sense to those of us who have not yet earned a doctorate degree.  A great source of references for the management of depression for those who prefer natural  remedies v. synthetic medications.  Anyone coping with depression/anxiety  will appreciate the thorough explanation of causes and alternative  treatment options for this illness.  As a sufferer of depression and  anxiety myself, I found the detailed explanations satisfyingly scientific  yet not too overwhelming for the lay person.  A friend  lent me the first  copy of this book:  I intend to buy at least 4 more copies for my relatives  and friends also coping with the symptoms of depression
