&quot;When Race Becomes Real&quot; initiates a discussion long overdue in America where the subject of race is so sensitive that it has become virtually taboo.  Some of the essays in this book touched me very deeply, some annoyed me, and others provided thoughtful new insights.  All of them impressed me with their sincerity.   After reading these writers' revelations about their own highly personal experiences and feelings in regards to race, one understands that there are many sides to the same truth, and that in order to approach any level of comfort in relations between the races, well meaning people need to be able to bare their souls without fear of censure or ridicule.  This stimulating work can be used to open up frank discussions in the classroom or the living room and is highly recommended to anyone who is ready for an honest examination of the unavoidable everyday complexity of race relations in America
