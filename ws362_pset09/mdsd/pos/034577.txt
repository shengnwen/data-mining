 I love this book and can't believe it's actually out of print. The author's spin on Medraut/Mordred-I wouldn't say it's original, because turning the bad guy into a sympathetic character has been done before, but it's probably the most successful attempt I've ever seen. Especially given the fact that the character base is so firmly established as bad. I actually found it very difficult to even like Lieu, since he was highly privileged and Medraut was so damaged by his parents(yes, by his father, too. How could he possibly leave his son with a woman like that?). He tries to go against the bent his life has put into him, only to be constantly rebuffed. Frivolous pop culture reference: Medraut reminds me very much of Lex Luthor from Smallville. Raised by a sadistic parent, treated with incessant suspicion, finally gives in and behaves the way everyone expects him to. Anyway, great, great book. Sequels aren't quite as engaging(and I'd love another book from Medraut's perspective), but they are definitely worth your time
