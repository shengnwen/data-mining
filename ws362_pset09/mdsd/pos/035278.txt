Firstly I must commend Mr Gayle for writing a romantic novel from the male perpective. No doubt there must male writers of this genre in the market place, but they don't spring to mind.Having read some of the reviews for this book, I can understand that the main protanganist,Will, can get a little bit irksome. But, I didn't find that to be the case. I enjoyed the various characters that amble into Wills life. I also loved the ending that caught me by surprise. A great first novel
