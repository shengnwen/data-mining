What an outstanding book! I would not be exageratting by saying that this book has influenced me, particularly my leadership style, more than any other. The ideas therein pop into my head several times a week, as the wisdom of crowds rears its head over the course of my day. Examples include viewer ratings on youtube, student ratings of teachers at the school where I work, online doctor ratings by patients, movie recommendations by the masses on Netflix, and more. The collective people's opinions are generally dead on - even when individual opinions vary. This is the premise of the book, and one that I am now firmly convinced of. 

Well done
