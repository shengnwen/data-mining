I would've given it 5 stars but it should get about 4.8 stars.

This is a brilliant idea.  For people like me who get too easily distracted to read for entertainment, hearing it being read for you is so much better.

And the material David has is great.  I first learned about David by way of his sister's work on Strangers with Candy, and got a book after I saw David on Letterman.  And then I remembered I get too distracted when reading for fun, which has been a life long deal.  So I got this on audio and it is a blast.
