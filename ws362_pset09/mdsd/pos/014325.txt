I really enjoyed this Book.Phil Jackson truly has a Gift for Breaking things down.the way He breaks down Players&the way they run plays&Structure things.Tex Winter&the Genius of the Triangle Offense is something else.He speaks on different players.insightful.you don't have His Success without knowing your Stuff
