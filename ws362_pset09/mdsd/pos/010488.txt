Chomsky is about the most intense polemicist one is ever likely to encounter, and as a consequence, when reading him one should be very careful to check his sources and be on guard for tenuous logical leaps. However, he is also has no fear of speaking the unspeakable, and a knack for exposing the dubious motives of much of U.S. foreign policy.

This volume consists of five chapters, the first four of which are a usful examination of the U.S. role in propping up third world dictatorships around the globe in order to facilitate a "good invesetment climate" for foreign capitol.  The fifth chapter is a highly questionable argument contending that "bloodbaths" in Communist controlled regions are played up for propaganda reasons. However, the wrong-headed nature of chapter 5.2 does not detract from the truthfulness of the analysis for the first four chapters. 

The book opens with a quote from Orwell: The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them." This is, in essence, the message of entire book, illustrated in example after example. Certainly worth a critical-minded read
