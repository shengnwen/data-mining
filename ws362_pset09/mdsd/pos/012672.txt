This book seriously has everything you need to know for running a local election. Whether you plan to read it cover to cover, or look things up as you go, this book will tell you what you need to know to be successful. Catherine Shaw has graciously written down everything she knows about a campaign and handed it to us on a silver platter. The only way to learn more than you learn with this book would be to work with Ms. Shaw in person! Don't run a local election without it
