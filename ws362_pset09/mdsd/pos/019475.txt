I'm not done reading this book, but so far, I'm elated that I purchased it. The book is very simple to read and Aunt Laya provides many of her personal life stories which is always delightful. I would highly recommend this book to any teenager, and also adults as the book offers heartwarming inspirations. You have nothing to lose and alot to gain from reading this book. You cannot go wrong with purchasing this book..at all! She doesn't say anything harmful, uncomforting nor dangerous for the human spirit. The price is reasonable for such a book. I suggest reading this book before bed, or after a relaxing shower. Your mind should be very relaxed, if not, you may have to read something twice! Enjoy ;-
