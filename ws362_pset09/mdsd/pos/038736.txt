I am 40 years old, a lifelong reader of literary fiction, and long a fan of really just a handful of modern American masters, Updike, Bellow, etc.  I mention this only because it has been many years since I have discovered an author worthy of inclusion, and Robert Hellenga is that author.  His novels are made from masterful language, and an intense examination of the human experience.  I give this book four stars for one reason only -- The Fall of a Sparrow is even better!  Read them both, and thank me later
