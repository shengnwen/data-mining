I read a borrowed copy of this book.  I enjoyed it so much I bought one and gave it to my surgeon son, who has no time to read, and insisted that he find the time to do so.  He loved it also.  Leave it to John Berendt to find the real characters that bring a city alive.  He outdid himself with this one giving one of the most beautiful cities of the world a 'realness' that transcends the architecture and makes you realize that the history of a place comes from its people, really the ones who make it tick.
