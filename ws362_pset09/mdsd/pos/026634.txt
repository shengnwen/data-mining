I not only bought this book for myself, but now I'm ordering one to give as a gift.  I like the way it clearly divides the major kayaking regions of the great Republic of California geographically and how each section--again very clearly--lists the tour's skill level, trip length, a map, a summary, hazards, and very often historical and other trival which can really add magic to a trip.  But shame on the author for not mentioning the largest inland body in all of California which is now highly threatened and draws literally millions of spectacular migrating birds daily in the winter (if YOU don't know what it is, shame on you!). BTW, the State Park ranger there hosts free kayaking tours (kayaks included) in the winter; the winds cause waves (yes, waves in an inland SEA--hint, hint) can be lethal other times, esp. fall. There are very cool places in my area that were not mentioned (I guess they'll remain my little secret-hahaha)and since the book is a little old now, a few things have changed, but otherwise, this book is a real gem
