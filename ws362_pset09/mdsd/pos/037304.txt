As some Doonesbury buffs will tell you, the period from the mid eighties into the first half of the ninties has been the true highpoint of the strip  thus far. This book covers an area in that oh-so-classic period, focusing  on the early 90's, which sees BD's suffering the price of Desert Storm, as  the once proud Hollywood man becomes a highway patrolman, taking baby Sam  along with him on crack raids and high speed chases (hence the title). The  first hintings of Mike and JJ's eventual divorce come here, as the two  struggle to raise Alex admist Mike's unemployment and life in their ever  degenerating slum apartment. And of course there's our ever stoned hero  Duke, recovering from a sleazebag's dream tripout in his post Club Scud  venture. A great piece of history for all Doonesbury fans alik
