I read this book when I was in the 4th grade. It took me almost 1 month to read this. I just resently reread this book and it took me less than a day. This book was the first Ann Rinaldi book I read. I have many different 'styles' of books that I like to read, but one of my favorites is historical fiction. This book just pulled me in. I couldn't put it down I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this book. I can't even begin to explain this book so you will just have to read it yourself.


A devoted reader,
