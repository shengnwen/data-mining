"Study and believe only those teachings that speak directly to your soul." These words are daylight and fresh air to a man trapped in a coal mine. Emmet Fox helped me to break free of the confusion and craziness peddled by established religion. I was free to realize a more intuitive understanding of God and of life. SERMON ON THE MOUNT gave me courage to set out on my own spiritual journey and to leave behind years of baggage from catholic school and church TV.
