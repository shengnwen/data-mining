I felt that Mike Gould's book was a positive move away from the majority of the other training books I have read on the subject.  The author makes a point to establish confidence in your dog while at the same time building the dog's confidence in you.  After reading this book, I realized that I was asking the dog for too much control and I was teaching the dog to act against its god given insticts.  I wish I had read this book earlier in my dog's training, but I still found it very useful for an already started dog.  I use my dog as both a waterfowler retriever and as an upland flushing dog and I felt Mr. Gould did an excellent job in training for the all-around hunting dog
