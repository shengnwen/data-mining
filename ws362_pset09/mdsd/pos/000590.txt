The very best thing about Laura Robb's newest book is that after you read it, you don't feel you need to meet her. As I read, whenever I had a question,want to see an example, or wish that a checklist might be on the next page, there it was! After reading it you will have post-its on specific pages, feel organized and know that you have to have two copies, one for home and one for school. The book is perfectly organized. A short chapter on the research that shapes a middle school reading program, is followed by strategy lessons that go through the process of reading almost anything: before,during, and after reading. These chapters are prefaced by a most helpful chapter on what strategic reading looks like in middle school. The chapters after are on ways to connect students to books, cross grade projects and a wonderful chapter on assessment. The appendices are perfect! They hit the nail on the head from reading surveys to open ended discussion questions (by genre). This book is truly the answer to a middle school reading teachers prayers
