Greg Iles' Footprints of God is a taut page-turner that has much competent high-tech research backing it up.  Unfortunately, there were research lapses in three areas: First, the reference to Robert Oppenheimer, the top nuclear scientist of the Manhattan Project, being "persecuted for years for his opposition to (Edward Teller's) hydrogen bomb."  Actually, Oppy was mainly opposed to the technical aspects of the H-Bomb production, not its moral aspects.  His being persecuted and stripped of his high security clearance after the McCarthy witchhunts was mainly the result of his having known communists earlier in his career, and having misled investigators about it.  He was done wrong, yes, but after his public career was ended he headed for Princeton, to the Center for Advanced Study where Einstein had presided. 
Second, every ambitious novel will have a bad patch of flawed reasoning.  This one occurs on page 359 (hardcover):
"And the miracles (of Jesus)?  Walking on water?  Raising the dead?"
"Jesus was a healer, not a magician.  Those stories were useful to those who built a religion around him." 
Well, Duh, and Duh again!  Sure "those stories were useful," but at least 25 of Jesus' miracles were healings.  So was he also not a healer?  
Third, on page 454 we get a reference to "the Antichrist predicted by the Book of Revelation."  Well, actually the Antichrist is only predicted as such in the canonical books of John 1 and 2.  Too bad those "long nights discussing philosophy and religion" mentioned in the Ackinowledgments didn't catch that.

Nevertheless, this is a mind-bending, thought-provoking epic that tells us all what adversities might happen in the future from the artificial intelligence forces developing around us.  For that reason, it is highly recommended reading.
