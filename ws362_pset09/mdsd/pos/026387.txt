Rob Bell, known for the set of DVD short films "NOOMA" and the leader of Mars Hill Church in Grand Rapids, has written a very good first effort. His is very unorthodox, not in the sense of his beliefs (though I cannot attest for all of them) but in is view of tradition and a progression in the formulation of Chritisnity. An easy read and it blessed me in several areas (finding our new identity in Christ, a "non-agenda" evangelism, discipleship). I do not agree with all the ideas presented in this book but I would recommend it as a good daily reading with a bit of a twist. Remember, this is someone else's revelation so don't blindly believe it but mediatate on it and, if necessary, "eat the fish and spit out the bones".
