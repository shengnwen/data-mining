So the audio book is abridged, what can you do? I just recently finished listening to this, and I love this story. Ayn Rand develops some of the most bizarre and interesting characters I've ever encountered. Some of them are likeable, while others are repulsive. I admire Rand's philosophy, although I don't agree with all of it. Not only is this a great story that I agree everyone should experience, I found that Edward Herrmann did an excellent job reading it. His reading was clear, and in almost every scene, I could clearly distinguish what characters were speaking. Commuter friendly. I wish I'd read this book in high school
