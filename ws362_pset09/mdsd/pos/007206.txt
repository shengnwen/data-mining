This book included quite a few of the tribes that coexisted with Keivan Rus as well.  I though the artwork is better than the average in the MAA series, with each plate incorporating its portraits into the whole scene.   My only regret is that it is light on Alexander Nevsky and the Mongol  invasions - just when Russian history starts to get interesting
