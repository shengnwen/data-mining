I mean, how can we pass judgement on 19 year old Americans (like those bad 19 year old Japanese and Germans) who gang raped old women and girls and then murdered them because they were just subhuman Vietnamese? 

Or like Bob Kerry who ordered old women and kids to have their throats cut, no americans could EVER be blamed for war crimes like those evil commies or nazis - because, well, we're AMERICANS for god's sake.

So what if our boys murdered infants and their mothers after forcing them to perfom oral sex?

Sure, things like My Lai happened all the time, but it was all a NOBLE CAUSE, right? just like operation iraqi freedom, right? We had to kill em in order to save em, right
