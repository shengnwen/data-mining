This is one of those books I picked up on a whim a few years ago and I was not familiar with the author until I discovered he had written "Just Cause"(great novel). From the first page on I could not put it down. It is an all consuming read and won't let go. Some paperbacks get tossed in a bag for library donations, and some get to sit on my shelf for future reading. This one is on the shelf where it will stay. Slamming book
