Bennett-Jones uses his journalistic eye to present a wide-ranging account of Pakistan from 1947 to today divided into broad themes. Ordinary Pakistani friends of mine may not like his book since it is very harsh in places but overall he is a man who understands Pakistan well. He paints a picture of Pakistan that holds lessons for all policy planners in India - that the pillars of the Pakistan state are the Army, the Islamic lobby, the Mohajirs and the indigenous populations of Sindh, Baluchistan, NWFP and Punjab. In particular the Punjabi lobby and the role of the Army are well-explained. For Indians wishing to understand Pakistan it holds the answer to the conundrum of how we ought to deal with a difficult relationship - we ought to deal with Pakistan at different levels. The one element I did not see explored in detail is the cost to Pakistan of a consistently anti-Indian stance the Pakistan Army has foisted on the polity. Surely this has distorted spending, and apart from the obvious data related to defense spending no other implications (sociological, economic) are explored. Still, a very satisfying read
