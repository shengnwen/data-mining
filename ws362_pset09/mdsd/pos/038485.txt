Ehryck, I must thank you for providing me with a copy of your latest and greatest book. I sat down with it before going to sleep and was truly uplifted by each chapter I read.  The icing on the cake was reading your inscription to me. . .The time is now.  God says jump.  He will catch you."  Those words capture the sentiment of the book and were truly a motivator. I must admit I fell asleep with a big smile on my face with great anticipation of things to come.  Ehryck has the gift of making people feel beautiful on the outside and inside. Keep on keepin' on. 

This book reminds me of two other powerful books I read dealing with the Law of Attraction and the teachings of Abraham (Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting - The astonishing power of Feelings by Lynn Grabhorn and Ask and it is Given - Learning to manifest your desires by Esther and Jerry Hicks).
