Rudolph has crafted a fairly exceptional account of a history of student life in "American College and University: A History." Overall, this text focuses on the cultural changes that occur in society that impact the college student and the college life.

I also recommend the following texts to be consulted while reading this book:

"A History of American Higher Education" by John Thelin
"American Higher Education" by Christopher Lucas
"Campus Life: Undergraduate Cultures from the End of the Eighteenth Century to the Present" by Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz

Finally, if you are interested in the history of co-operative living I highly recommend the following historical account about the University of Kansas: "Making Do and Getting Through" by Fred McElhenie (it is locally published for the University of Kansas by Oread Books)
