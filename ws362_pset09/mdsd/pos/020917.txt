I love this book so much that I decided to skip writing & English one day and do a report about it instead.  There are so many different weapons.  Don't look at that one star rating because he doesn't know what "arms" means.  He thought it meant arms like a limb.

It has so much cool stuff like an early grenade launcher, early grenades and a lot of different helmets.  It goes from the stone age to the Old West.  

The pictures are so great I decided to copy some of them and put them on a poster board and write about them.

Right now I'm eight years old and I'm mostly interested in WWII but this really caught my attention.  I think it's better than most of the WWII books.

I can't say anything bad about this book because there is nothing and if there was something bad, I would have told it.  

I think people that are interested in weapons and if they want to make a project about time periods like medieval or old west, they will really like this book.  I wish I could buy it but I haven't seen it at the library sales or thrift stores.   I think you should buy it or borrow it at the library.
