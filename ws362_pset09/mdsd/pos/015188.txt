Like another reviewer suggested, this book should be required reading.  I had to read it for a class in college and put off starting it because it didn't seem that interesting.  When I finally got around to it, I read the whole book in one night, alternately laughing hysterically and crying my eyes out.  My roommate must have thought I was insane.  Since then I've reread The Education of Little Tree many times and always seem to find something new in it.  The story of Little Tree's "education" and the book's narration from a five year-old's perspective is priceless.  Even knowing the author wasn't really raised by Cherokee grandparents doesn't detract from the book at all.  Buy it now or go to the library or borrow it from a friend, tape up your ribs so you don't bust them from laughing, grab a box of tissues, and find a cozy spot to get to know Little Tree.
