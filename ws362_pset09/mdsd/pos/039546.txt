Charles Sanders Pierce (1839-1914), scientist, mathematician, logician and the founder of pragmatism, did not have the bulk of his mathematical papers published until Mrs. Carolyn Eisele edited them and skillfully put them together for this 1976 edition.  This four-volume (in 5 books) set covers Arithmetic (Vol 1), Algebra and Geometry (Vol 2), Mathematical Miscellanea (Vol 3-- spread out over two books), and Mathematical Philosophy (Vol 4).  List price on this set is over $400.  Each book includes a black-and-white photograph of Pierce, or related sketch, near the beginning of the book.  Pierce's works here include all sorts of interesting mathematical ideas, many of which are very original and interesting to read.  He touches on logic, puzzles, mathematical philosophy, decision theory and probability theory, among others.  He has some interesting ideas about mathematics education as well.  These volumes have received almost no advertising or reviews, which is a shame.  They are great and provide a real insight into Pierce's mathematical ideas.
