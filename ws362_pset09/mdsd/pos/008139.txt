this book is awesome. it full of seven chilly stories about ghost. vivian is a great and amazing authoess. Each stories has a twist but i t hink Drop by Drop was a pretty twisted story.....the ending will scare everything out of you. each story is different with different meaning. they all are just as spooky as the one before. I loved each one, the good thing is there's a small story in between the big ones so you dont get bored or tired. It keeps you very interested. each story is really good. there great stories to tell at sleepovers and to all your friends on a dark spooky night, lol. Everyone should read this book, its amazing
