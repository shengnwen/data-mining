My mother-in-law actually bought this book for me as a joke. I LOVE Halloween (and LOATHE Martha Stewart), so she thought it would be a good gag. When she handed it to me, she said she thought it would be funny, but she had looked through it and thought I might actually like it.
I started to flip through it waiting for the kitschy-cutesy Halloween stuff to come grinning out at me, but there was none! Martha is known for her "Good Things", but when it comes to Halloween, she knows her "Bad Things" too!
Lots of classic spooky atmosphere decorations, and tons of great ideas that I had never seen before. If I had to buy just one Halloween book, it would be this one - seriously.
However, don't get carried away on Martha's excellent handling of Halloween. Her Halloween CD is the same old drab fare that you can find on any cheesy Halloween sounds album
