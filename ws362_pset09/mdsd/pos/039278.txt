This book covers a lot of ground and is easy to follow (sometimes too easy). A lot of the contents can be redundant for those with a background in marketing, finance, etc. but it is well rounded. I compared it to the Dummies equivalent and found this one to be a better read (I usually buy  Dummies though - this is my first Idiots guide)
