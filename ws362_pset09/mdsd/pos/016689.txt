The deserts are wonderful, I ate myself into a frenzy with the peanutbutter cookies, and they were all made with splenda you betcha, I no longer crave sugar free deserts I cook them.This book is truly a gift to share with others. Just like my new beverage of choice that replaced my morning brew. Its called s oyfee and taste so wonderful with no caffeine or acids. Organic and made from soya! Bye bye acid stomach and hello healthy tummy! Google it under "acid free coffee"
I just got the book and I made the Heavenly Cheesecake. It was the best cheesecake I have ever had. Honestly. I am amazed that it has no sugar. It also tastes so rich that it is hard to believe it is low in fat. I would recommend the book on this recipe alone, although, there are many more recipes that I am anxious to try. For anyone watching the sugar, fat, or calories in their diet, this book really is unbelievable.
