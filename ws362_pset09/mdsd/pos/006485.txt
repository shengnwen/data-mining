The Red Pony is a touching story about a boy who learns to care for a pony then loses it. 

At first I had thought it was a kids story because I had gotten the book from my grandmothers house and it was written inside the cover that it was given to my aunt when she was only ten. But I was obviously mistaken because there are some parts of the book that would be too much for young children.
