I sure didn't realize that YHWH was disappearing as the OT progresses until Friedman pointed it out, and then I slapped my head and wondered why I never noticed it. One of my favorite things about this book is his examination of why this might be happening, this struggle between YHWH and his children. This struggle for us to grow up, to open our eyes and to see that we've got to get back to the garden, that we are stardust, we are golden . . . .

I was also touched by his discussion of Nietzche. The first feller to make an explicit, public break with God since Daddy didn't seem to be coming back. He wanted us to face the truth and grow stronger.  Poor guy. I never knew much bout him till I read Friedman's account of his life and work.

And how does Friedman end this? By saying the prodigals need to come home. He mentions Tikkun. I'm not sure if he mentions climbing the Tree of Life as well. What a wonderful book. I hope to own it someday
