I've read nearly every one of John Grisham's books and while I like almost all of them, it is my opinion that his best work was done in his first 5 books, those being A Time To Kill, The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, and The Chamber.  The Chamber, to me, is the most powerful among these books because more than any other book by Grisham, it brings a hot button justice issue out in the open and it challenges the way people think about that issue.  Before reading The Chamber, I was 100% in support of the death penalty for murderers . . . and eye for an eye so they say.  I guess in some ways, I still am.  However, The Chamber made me question my beliefs on capital punishment.  I finished the book thinking that perhaps the death penalty isn't always the most suitable punishment for a murderer.  It is just as simple to say "an eye for an eye" as it is to say that killing is wrong and this book definitely makes you consider both sides of the issue.

The ending scene is, without a doubt, the most power scene that you will find in any Grisham book.  I am a grown man and I can say without pride that I was moved to tears by The Chamber's final pages.  If you're a Grisham fan or a book enthusiast of any kind or even if you have a strong stance on either side of the capital punishment debate, you simply must read The Chamber
