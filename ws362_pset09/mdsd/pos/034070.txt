Without a doubt, this is the best and first book one would want to read to familiarize onesself with the basic tenets of Judaism.  It is readable to Jew and non-Jew alike (note the review by the Kuwaiti Muslim), and should stand (well-worn) on the bookshelf of anyone interested in the the Five Great Religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Taoism).

As for revisions, what is there to revise?  I've seen printings of this book going back to the 1970s, and they are definitive.  Although written from an Orthodox perspective, Donin's writings are as useful to any of the many new Jewish movements beyond the well-known Conservative and Reform groups (please note--it is Reform Judaism, not "Reformed"--empahsising the intentions of the founders to reformation within Jewish practice, akin to the Protestant reformaton).

For the Holocaust scholar or amateur historian--be thankful that this book was not available to Eichmann--who did study Judaism. This knowledge was used against Jews.  Somehow, his teacher (a rabbi) was not able to get across the beauty of the traditions, but then again, his student had already made up his mind and was not malleable.  Some non-Jews reading this book will look for more...Donin's companion book on Jewish prayer would be a good place to start.

Highly recommended to Jew, non-Jew, scholar or educated lay readers
