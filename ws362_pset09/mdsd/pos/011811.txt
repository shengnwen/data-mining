As a photographer myself I have always been attracted to the idea of seeing the original contact sheets from which a finished print is  first judged.

One of the greatest photo shows I have ever seen of Gary Winogrand included large scale preproduction's of some of his contact sheets and it has always stayed with me.

In Jim Marshalls "Proof" that is exactly what you get. A contact sheet with all of his markings and foot notes and then the print that was pulled from that process. Side by side.

It is a great learning tool and a great visual look into the mind of a Photographer that has taken an inordinate amount of iconoclastic images, particularly from within the music world
