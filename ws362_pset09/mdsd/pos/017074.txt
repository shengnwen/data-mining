There's not much to add to the reviews below.  Sir Fred Hoyle, scientist and polymath extraordinaire, was also one of our greatest sci-fi novelists, and it is a pity that his SF works are not better known.  Anyway, its all here with a brilliant prescience:  scientific discovery, political obtrusiveness, nuclear winter, the steady-state universe theory, the unintelligibility of extraterrestial intelligent life, right down to the tragic ending.  Any lover of thoughtful SF should read this excellent book
