Krakauer delivers yet another well-written book, this time about two brutal murders ostensibly committed in the name of religion.  The account of the murders of Brenda and Erica Lafferty is enough to warrant a book of its own.  What Krakauer does, effectively in my opinion, is to convey the implicit message that, while we may be at war with those who seek to kill us in the name of their religion, we have homegrown fanatics right here in the U.S. who are willing to do the same.  Krakauer's point is this:  religious fanaticism is not confined to Islam, although that may be the focus of our attention at this time.

The fact that the Lafferty murders were committed by Mormon fundamentalists isn't necessarily a slight to Mormonism.  Clearly, what the murderers did in the name of their faith is not in accordance with today's mainstream Mormon church
