This is a great introduction to the medium.  I've painted with acrylics for a few years and wanted to experiment with encaustic.  Mattera gives a simple but thorough overview of encaustic.  After reading this book I felt I had the basic knowledge I needed to start and it has continued to guide and inspire my exploration.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in painting with wax
