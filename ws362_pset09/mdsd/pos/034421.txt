The title is slightly misleading-it is ideas that are always in conflict.  The measure of Justice is how those conflicts are dealt with.  The transformational concept presented by Hampshire is that which side of the argument prevails is not nearly as important as the system used to determine which side prevails.  He observes that there are always arguments to be made on each side of a difference of opinion whether it be pro or anti abortion or pro or anti assisted suicide or pro or anti welfare state or pro or con on ethnic cleansing.  The important thing to a civilized society is that when decisions are made on these issues that both winners and losers in the debate accept the outcome peacefully rather than degenerating into violence.  The measure of Justice is the willingness of the interested parties to accept the result peacefully rather than resorting to violence.  If there is to be any hope of peace in the world it is through the kind of Justice that Hampshire describes, where parties in conflict are willing to trust institutions rather than war to eventually determine which side will prevail.  As a measure of Hampshire's power of persuasion, he won me over even though I am quite conservative while he describes himself as a liberal who holds a number of opinions on social issues I strongly disagree with
