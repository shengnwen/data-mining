This book was compact and well documented with wonderful quotes, stories and pictures.  I felt privileged to have been allowed to share the deep thoughts and very personal reflections of a man who has had a vast impact in the very challenging world of modern pistolcraft and riflery. You will find yourself very quickly turning the last page of the book, looking forward to yet another page of Col Cooper's wisdom and wit.  I currently have next on my booklist, "To Ride, Shoot Straight, And Speak The Truth" by Col. Cooper.  His books on modern pistolcraft and riflery are truly the Standard by which all others in this genre are judged
