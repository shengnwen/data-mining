Throughout the novel the story is told from many different perspectives in chronological order. This makes the story of the 1906 earthquake very interesting and covers many aspects plaguing San Francisco at the time. James Dalessandro must have done extensive research into the time period because the amount of information and detail was extremely vast. The overall content of the book was very enriching because it opened up the reader's eyes to particular insights that are logically sound but are difficult to find all in one book. 
Dalessandro uses hooks and plot twists to keep his reader interested and his use of short chapters makes the reading move quickly and doesnt require much attention. There was no confusion in his sub-plotlines which could have easily been disasterous. 
Eventhough the book contains great information compiled in an easy to read fashion I would not reccomend the novel to anyone that wants to read well written story. The simplicity of Dalessandro's writing style really turned me off and left me desiring more from his use of language. His inclusion of Italian phrases and sayings was certainly an unexpected treat. 
Overall James Dalessandro tells a compelling story of the 1906 earthquake but when he wrote the novel he had a screenplay in mind and this would be where he fell short. So in conclusion, if you want to read a good story and you arent a literature junkie then you will be at ease with 1906: A Novel
