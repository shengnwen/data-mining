A great story!  Although written in the 1960's, the mixing of technological devices with basic human traits in a government agent works just as well today.  If you make a few substitutions (such as cell phones for radio aerial in a mast), this novel would be a best seller in the 21st century.  In any era, the man pulling the trigger must still justify his actions.
