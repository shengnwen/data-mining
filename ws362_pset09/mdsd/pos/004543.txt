The Global Corporation is required reading for those who seek to understand the complex issues and problems that are an important part of  the future of those companies seeking to do business outside of their  traditional home market. The book is well rounded in scope and conveys its  message in a clear, concise and easy to follow manner. It first begins with  a lesson in the history of the world economy and its various market  structures. The rest of the book is dedicated to analyzing the multifaceted  issues that are common to all companies who are now or will in the future  compete in the multinational/global arena. I highly recommend this book to  anyone whose career, interests, or academic studies are in anyway related  to economics and business
