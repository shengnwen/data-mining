Ed Emberley's Drawing Book of Trucks and Trains is one of the best drawing books I have ever encountered.  It starts the most complex designs with simple shapes, such as a long rectangle for a locomotive, and builds on it.  My 4 year old nephew LOVES following the directions and building his trains.  Be sure to have plently of colored pencils or markers on hand to help enhance the drawings.  I love this book and I am looking into buying more
