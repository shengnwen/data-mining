Europe's Last Summer offers a revealing look at the myriad causes of World War I, particularly for those of us whose high school history textbooks taught that it was brought about simply by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Not only does Fromkin lay out the case that the murder was merely a convenient pretext for a war that Austria-Hungary was already planning, but also that this otherwise local conflict was then twisted by Germany to become the catalyst for a European war that she believed to be both inevitable and necessary.

While the table of contents officially lists eight parts, I think the book is more neatly divided into two. In the first section Fromkin presents a broad overview of European history in the years leading up to the war. The background information helps explain why Austria-Hungary and Germany desired war and how the various European alliances were formed. In the second section Fromkin analyzes the so-called "July crisis", the thirty-seven day period between the assassination and the outbreak of war. While this conflict may have been inevitable, a remarkable series of events had to occur for it to begin in 1914. Fromkin does an excellent job of explaining how, seemingly against all odds, it happened.

As other reviewers have noted, the book can feel redundant at times. And for those already well-versed in World War I history, Europe's Last Summer is unlikely to offer any groundbreaking new information. However, as someone generally interested in history I found the book perfectly readable and highly informative
