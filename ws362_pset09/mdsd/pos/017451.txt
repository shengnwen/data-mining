Fareed Zakaria rightly forces his readers to think harder than they usually do about the interdependence existing between freedom and democracy.  In the West, constitutional liberalism, with its checks and balances, gave birth to modern democracy.  However, too much democracy can paradoxically lead to less freedom. Think for instance about humiliated Germany after WWI under the Weimar Republic and its subsequent mistreatment of different minorities for specious reasons under the Nazis.  Similarly, more choices can result into less accountability.  Think for instance about those who fail to plan financially for old age independent of a social security system increasingly at risk of insolvency due to shifting demographics.  In the U.S. and overseas, right without responsibility is usually as immoral and unjust as responsibility without right.  Unelected bodies such as the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Federal Reserve, or the World Trade Organization are a necessary evil.  Expertise of their respective members is judged more important than their democratic legitimacy to hopefully pursue the better good of either a human community or a society of sovereign states.  These unelected officials are not held accountable to the tyranny of instant gratification that too many elected officials perceive, rightly or wrongly, among a majority of their constituents.  Because unelected bodies are a necessary evil to account for human weaknesses, they should remain the exception rather than the rule.  Pleading for an increase in unelected bodies, though well-intentioned, could paradoxically lead to a weakening support of the best-in-class in their respective categories.
