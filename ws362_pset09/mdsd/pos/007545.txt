  This isn't a very big book, but it is sure worth the price and time to read and to put some of the things discussed,into practice.
  Saying the right thing ,particularly at a difficult time or about a subject that is a bit delicate,is much more important than we often realize.
  The authors deal with a lot of conversations and give responses that often come to mind,but should be avoided. Then they give a response that would be much more appropriate for all involved, Then they give a short explanation of why a more gentlemanly or mannerly response is much better.
  Of course,they cannot give a proper response for every situation;but after reading the book you will see that the basic principle is there to see. It is somewhat like the Golden Rule of "Do unto others as you would have others to do onto you".
  In most cases,the reply you give should be the same as you would like to have received,if you were being replied to. People will make hurtful comments to you ,but don't fall for replying in a like manner. Stay above that and give a polite reply and move on.
  Conversation,like most relationships,should be guided by the old adage; You'll catch more flies with honey than vinigar.
  While there really isn't anything in the book that your Mom Or Dad couldn't have told you; it is still worth reading to remind us of how we should reply in a variety of situations
