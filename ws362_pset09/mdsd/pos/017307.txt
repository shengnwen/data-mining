	I liked this book because there's a girl named Mary Lou, who is writing a journal.At the beginning she's saying mean stuff about someone and at the end the person gets hurt and she looks back in her journal and realizes how mean shes been. 

	Mary Lou has many cousins,but on of them, Carl Ray, comes and lives with her because he says he wants to find a job. The real reason is that he wants to find his real father. But what he doesn't know is that it's someone who lives really close to Mary Lou. To find out who Carl Ray's real dad is, read the book.

	I would recommend this to someone who likes to write a journal or a diary because the girl, Mary Lou, writes a journal, but I think anyone can read this book
