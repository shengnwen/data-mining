I have tried to read other books about Elizabeth, but more often than not they were dry historical tomes.  They focused more on the role this woman played in the course of British history rather than the figure herself.

A powerful single female monarch in and of itself is intriguing.  One born into such a dramatic period of British history is truly fascinating---and obviously begs an inquiry as to what made her tick. 

This book, while fiction, does just that.  It provides some guess as to what motivated a very intelligent, cunning woman who prevaricated with finesse during truly difficult times.

While bringing Elizabeth alive as a truly three dimensional person, this book also breathes life into the times in which she lived--a time wrought with treachery, greed and power plays by all so inclined.

The book is long and could be considered slow at times.  However, I believe this has more to do with the thoroughness of the book rather than the writing style.

Beyond this criticism I dont agree with the other negative reviews here.  Why some reviewers find it difficult to believe that Elizabeth may have been fixated on her love life seems strange---afterall, all of England and the continent was surely was fixated for some time on her love life.  (A fixation, btw, she used as one of her many political tools of leading England to its rise in power.)
