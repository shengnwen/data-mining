 well I read other reviews regarding this book, many were not very helpful

Strenths- This book does a great job with muscular artistry, some of the details are comparable to netters atlas in visual details, not identification of mustles.  The histo and physio are pretty decent, I also use histolgy by gartner and hyatt and BRS physio along with Gyuton for reference, althought not as detailed as those books, it does a great job for a quick into to medical physio.


Weakness- if your a medical student, ligament descriptions are almost non existant dispite muscular details, maybe not that important for undergrad anatomy.  Also, mustle diagrams not on same page as functional details, I heard this was corrected in 11th edition, finally the neuro section is poor, lacks diagrams, however, this book is not advertizing itself as a neuro book so thats not unexpected, netters neuro atlas is great, overall worth the money
