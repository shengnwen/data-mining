It is a shame that there are not more books out there like this one with fast moving suspense.  All I could think of while reading this book was how tight the story was.  Ira Levin does not waste a single word.  He gets right to the point and holds you there!!  This book made me want to read everything that Ira Levin has ever written.  Fantastic!!  If you like great suspense, psychological thrillers and stories with a twist...this book is definately for you!
