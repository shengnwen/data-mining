Aesop's Fables are a good way to introduce children to fine literature.  This is especially easier in lovely illustrated editions.  These fables of ancient Greece have been known to civiliation for centuries, and they are as apt now as when they were penned in the sixth century A.D.  These fables were devised by Aesop to get out of any difficulty that he may have encountered with his master.  He was a slave after all.  The stories were mainly about the birds and beasts of field and forest, but everyone except Aesop's rather stupid master understood the meaning behind them.  A fairly quick and easy read, but one well worth attempting
