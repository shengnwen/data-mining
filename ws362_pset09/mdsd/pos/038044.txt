I don't know why this book is given such sad review. I think some "critics" take themselves too seriously and think that they alone know what makes a book a good read. Just remember that criticism is only opinion and rarely the last word in good taste. I checked this book out from the library and really enjoyed it. I am an avid reader and find that "critics" forget to have fun with a book. Don't let nay-sayers deter yourself from at least browsing through this one at the library or bookstore.
