When Genius Failed was an enjoyable and informative read about the rapid success and even more rapid implosion of the legendary hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.

The book covers the development of the fund, the personalities behind it, the fund's strategies and the theory underlying them, as well as the failure of the fund.  

The author seems to emphasize the reliance of LTCM on statistical models to make their investment decisions, and how these models failed to account for patterns in group behaviour which consequently resulted in events occurring that were all but statistical impossibilities.  It was this coincidence of unlikely events that led to the fund's collapse.  

When Genius Failed was a very interesting read about an important time in Wall St. history.  Unlike Den of Thieves and other important Wall St. history books, the book is relatively short, making it a manageable read
