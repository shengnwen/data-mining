I was able to meet Dr. Terry at a conference held by my church and found him to be a most enjoyable, approachable, and humble man.  This book will be valuable to both the seminarian and layman as well.  If you're preparing for missions, get this book.

Being both seminary prof (Southern Baptist Theological Sem.) and missionary, his experience plus knowledge makes for a cutting edge tool to "mish" from.

I heartily recommend this book
