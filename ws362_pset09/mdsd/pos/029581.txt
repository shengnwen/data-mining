Sure there will be some who disagree with some of the rankings, but it's all subjective and those with a differing opinion should realize that.  Plus the voting wasn't just a bunch of nobody's, it was the opinion of a respected and knowledgeable panel. To paraphrase what Nack says in the intro, the best thing about the list is that it causes you to think about the candidates and draw your own list.  In my opinion, the fillies are shorted a bit.  Ruffian at 35?  Undefeated Personal Insign #48? Honest Lady at #76 and Miesque at #82, and who could forget Genuine Risk at #91, though she was fouled out being the only filly to take the first two legs of the Triple Crown.  I'm of the belief that under Whittingham and Shoemaker, Spectacular Bid may have never lost.  Say what you want about going a mile and a half, but he only lost at those distances after stepping on a pin once and a second to the older Affirmed when Bid was not tightened for that race.  True, he didn't have competition in the form of other horses, but his competition came from the clock, which he stopped in record times at different distances for all three years of his career.  If not for the Belmont accident, he'd be top 5 for sure
