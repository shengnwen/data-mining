This is the first Taschen Basic Architecture volume about a living architect.  The earlier Taschen volumes have been about the Modernist masters such as Mies, Le Corbusier, Loos, Wright, Kahn and Neutra.  If there is any living architect who can measure up to this Pantheon of Greats, it is Pritzker Prize winner, Tadao Ando.  

Like the other volumes in this series, there is a short biographical essay, followed by short chapters that focus on key works.  The German Publishing Company Taschen publishes some of the best architectural books.  Their books are always of the highest quality and reasonably priced.  At Ten Dollars, it is hard to imagine a better introduction to the works of one of the most important architects of the Twentieth Century. Highly recommended.
