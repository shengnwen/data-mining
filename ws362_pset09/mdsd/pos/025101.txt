Eighteen-year-old Miranda Lockheart was never what you would call a wild child. She lived in the same small town all of her life - Barton, Texas - and never ventured out to the city. She had grown up with her friends, and had been with her boyfriend, Denny Callahan, since freshman year. But after graduation, everything changed. Miranda received a scholarship to Lone Star State College in Austin, Texas, and jumped at the chance to get a taste of the city. Oddly enough, it suits her perfectly. Suddenly, Miranda is sharing an apartment with two outrageous girls - one, a punk; the other, a "loose" girl - and taking up the drums. Miranda has no previous experience with the drums, but she picks them up instantly, and suddenly finds herself dragged up into a whirlwind rollercoaster ride, complete with hot guys, gigs, and band practice. The only downfall is that the one guy she's crushing on doesn't seem to know that she exists.

I'm a HUGE fan of Nancy Krulik, and, due to the fact that I've just started playing the guitar, I'm super interested in reading different teen fiction about female musicians, so SHE'S GOT THE BEAT caught my eye, and captured my heart in no time. Miranda is a fabulous character, whose sweet personality, and rocker chick persona are fun to read about. Her adventures - or, rather, misadventures - in the dating world, and guy encounters are hilarious, and add a fun, relatable aspect for readers. Overall, this was a fabulous addition to the SIMON PULSE ROMANTIC COMEDY series.
