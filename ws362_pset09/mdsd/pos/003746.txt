Hochschild's book is a superb description of what so many of of us live  but barely understand. She examines the demands of work in the home and  outside, the gender identities that shape our feeling toward work, the  goals that shape our chices and the intentions that define our  commununication about responsiblity. The author validates the struggle of  working women, without bashing men and talks about how to resolve the  &quot;stalled revolution&quot; of shared responsibility both at home and in  the workplace. Most importantly, Hochschild illuminates how our methods of  dealing with the second shift, not the second shift itself per se,  negatively impact our children
