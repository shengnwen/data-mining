David Spurr's book provides an excellent discussion of common themes in colonial discourse - such as the affirmation of the "white man's burden" or the negation of other cultures' intrinsic value - and how they survive to this day - whether intentionally or subconsciously. For those who might believe language in western writing about Africa, Asia and Latin America is - at least nowadays - usually objective and neutral, take a closer look! Excellent thematic treatment of the subject, with lots of interesting and revealing illustrations taken from journalistic and travel writing past and present
