This was a really enjoyable read during a violent tropical storm that kept a lot of us indoors this holiday. Lately I have read some really bad examples of the genre known as chik lit. This book is different. Not only is the story fun, but there is a point to it beyond watching the super rich go shopping and get invitations to cocktail parties. The total insanity surrounding getting kids into the "right" schools today, at least in the New York area, is very much a reality and the author's satire is right on target. The stress and the hassles are unbelievable, and affect the middle and upper middle classes as well as the very rich. I know lots of people who have been in, or are anticipating being in, the position of Helen and Michael. It starts in preschool and goes on through graduate school. I read straight through this book and got a lot of laughs, but also recognized a lot of types. The school auction at the end is really funny. If you enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada, you'll like this book
