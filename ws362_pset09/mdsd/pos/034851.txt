... but my brother lent me his copy of the book after he lost 16 kg on the diet and I thought, what the heck, let's give this a go. When I actually reading the book I was surprised- my conception of the atkins diet had been very misinformed. 

what more can I say? 
I cut carbs. I Followed The Program and didn't run off and follow my own twisted version of the diet. I exercised (60 min walk a day plus 3 hours intense workout per week)

and voila

lost 21 kg in 4 months

maybe you can too if you actually stick to what he wrote?

hope so
