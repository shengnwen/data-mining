My son checked out this book from his school library and he loved it so much we bought it. Often it is hard to find well written and appropriate children's books. Officer Buckle and Gloria is an easy read with wonderful illustrations and a nice story. My son continues to give us updates on safety tips he thinks of. I recommend this to everyone with young children.
