These are beautiful books with many color illustrations and good tips for visual design. The set, though, is disappointing in that the box appears to be sized for four, rather than three, books, and the empty slot is filled with a white cardboard placeholder, making the set seem cheesy. Maybe another book is coming out soon to fill that slot -- I hope so.
