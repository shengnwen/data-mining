This was the first Graham Greene novel I read, encouraged because it was my cousin (and her husband's) favorite book. Little did I know I would relate to the protagonist so much. 
I, firstly, would like to say I loved this book. True human suffering does not always have to be gory. Emotional suffering can sometimes "cut deeper". Greene's writing style and legitimate emotion and conflict had me analyzing all of my romantic relationships. 
Although I am not a "religious fan" I feel that her turn toward God and religion was a plausible one. One that many people would use to end an affair. 
The book captures the idea that you can't choose who you love but that there are always consequences for adultery. 
Religious revelation leaves a nasty taste in my mouth, but again, I've seen it happen to real people, so the fact that fictional characters are going through something real, makes the book and the story and love believable. 
After reading this Graham I ended up reading most of his works in a few short months. 
Graham's books are definately classics in their own right and capture the human heart, human emotion, and human deception in a unique way that I relate to.
