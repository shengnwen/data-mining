Jeffrey Richter is my hero, he really is. This guy is simply amazing. I just cant imagine how he pulls it off - the toughest topics explained in the clearest manner.Moreover, he has achieved this feat over and over again. Any book he has written is testimony for this.
In his books, you would find information where you wouldnt find in any other place. You would also find information you can find elsewhere, but not as clear as his. He has the advantage of working closely with Microsoft and consulting with the .NET team, but I would say he would be a great author and teacher even without that advantage. 
As about this book, it should not be your first C# book. I suggest you get beginner's C# book first (if you dont know any C#), I suggest Jesse Liberty's book, and then come to this book. You would get a tremendous advantage over people who havent read this book and your understanding of the building blocks of .NET platform would be in depth. His chapters on Threading alone is worth the price of the book. This book is an absolute pleasure to read, just like any other book from Richter. Grab your copy today itself ! If there really is a 5 star book, this one is it.
Nobody writes like Richter, nobody.
