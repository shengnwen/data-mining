If one is searching for a biography of John Ford, this is not the book.  (A suggestion--Scott Eyman's &quot;Print the Legend&quot;  Another, with a slightly different emphasis but still with insightful observations--&quot;John Wayne's America&quot; by Garry Wills.) But as an analysis of specific Ford films as well as the themes he used  throughout his career, this book is invaluable.  Gallagher's style is a bit too academic at times, but he offers some interesting observations  (His examination of the structure of &quot;The Searchers&quot; is particularly memorable)
