Understand that I'm a geek myself, so don't think it a dig if I say this is a book about geeks for geeks.  This book chronicles the many folks behind the scenes that contributed so much to this magical time in computers, graphics, and film-making.  If you tinkered at all with graphics in the 80s or if you appreciate the amazing 3d stuff done in movies today (and how much work obviously goes into them) then you will enjoy this book.  If your just a big Lucas fan and want to know more about the making of Star Wars, this probably isn't your book.  However, for a wanna-be 3d graphics wiz, this book was a really interesting read
