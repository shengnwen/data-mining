        Chili Palmer's back, and oh, how we missed him! "Get Shorty" is one of my favorites by Elmore Leonard, he of the darkly dynamic prose.  It was full of the author's trademark black comedy and devilish doings - so is "Be Cool."

	Actor/Director Campbell Scott must have had a high old time reading this story as he inhabits all the voices with glib authority, whether it be a gangsta' or the redoubtable Chili himself.

	"Be Cool" finds Chili down on his luck - his recent flick was box office poison and he's eager to find fame in filmdom again.  As it happens, he's doing lunch with Tommy Athens, a record company bigwig and longtime bud.  Dessert has to be skipped because Tommy's gunned down in what appears to be a mob inspired killing.  Presto - Chili's convinced a movie about the music business could be his next big one.

	Always one to seize an opportunity Chili ingratiates himself with  the Los Angeles police officer in charge of investigating the case.  Soon, Chili is seeing every development has another chapter in his movie scenario.

	Of course,  there's a love interest - name of Linda Moon, a little yellow rose from Texas.  Her manager doesn't cotton to Chili nor do a few other murderous types.  Nonetheless, as the title says, be cool, and Chili is the coolest of all.
