If you are not afraid of humor at its darkest, sickest, strangest and certainly most un-politically correct you'll love this book.  These cartoons reminds me of Spike &amp; Mike's Sick &amp; Twisted Animation Festival.  It's also nice to see a Callahan book with a theme (Dogs).  On the other hand if you like your humor simple &amp; sweet I suggest you stay with Family Circles
