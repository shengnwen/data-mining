This book encompasses the memoirs of Mr. Abel, an educated, middle class, urban dweller from Venezuela, who decides to journey throughout the primative wilderness of Guyana; he is transformed in the process.  _Green Mansions_ is a harrowing adventure story, a romance, but is, above all, probably one of the most artistically stylized pieces on nature ever written.  Mr. Abel is vulnerable to his new environment's treacherous heat, its indigenous wildlife, the cruelties (as well as the hospitality) of its native peoples, and suffers periods of disease and starvation.

Mr. Abel falls in love with a strange, beautiful, and exceedingly elusive young woman, named Rima, who has a rare affinity with nature and its creatures.  Rima, whose mysterious family background figures strongly in the plot, is raised by her grandfather, Nuflo, after her mother dies.  Mr. Abel accuses Nuflo of hypocracy, but eventually comes to respect him.  Mr. Abel, despite his background and personal attitudes, learns to adapt to and eventually to accept nature on its own terms.  As frightening and disturbing as many of the parts of this extraordinary book are, it is never less than mesmerizing
