When you boil this book down to its basics, it teaches basic windows programming in the context of creating simple 2d sprite based games that simulate 3d enviroments. It does not teach C++, nor should it. It does not teach DirectX, or openGL, nor should it, nor does it ever claim to. It does not teach poor programming practices, like writing an entire application in a single file, that is insanity.

It accomplishes its goals and does it in an interesting and fun manner, what more could you want in a primer?

I wish they would do away with the nonsense "learn X in 24 hours/1week/3 nanoseconds" titles and name them something more appropriate.  No one can learn the windows API in 24 hours, no one can learn the C++ language in a week. It is fraudulent to even try and claim to. Most of the books in this series are pretty decent, although not for a serious CS student or professional programmer. They are however, decent books for lay people who can't or don't want to learn the ins and outs of computer systems, but like tinkering around with them and creating programs. They are also a decent,inexpensive way to learn material that would normally be taught in elective courses, although these books don't go far enough to become an expert, it is still a decent beginning
