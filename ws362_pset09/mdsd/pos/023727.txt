This book is a must read if you've ever had challenges communicating with anybody, anywhere, about anything (it lives up to its title and more). I was able to use the toolkits from the minute I finished the first chapter to influence my business partner, get my employees (and kids) to listen to me, and improve my relationship with my wife. It's funny, easy to read, and loaded with examples. One of the best books I've ever read
