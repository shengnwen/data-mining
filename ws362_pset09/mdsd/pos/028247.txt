I live in Spokane, WA and have, for some reason, avoided reading Alexie for many years.  I recently picked up The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven and was immediately hooked onto Alexie's stories and prose.  Many of the stories were identifiable with my American Indian friends.  Alexie is able to convey the complexities of living and growing up on very difficult and, for 90% of the American population, unidentifiable conditions.  If you think the stories are 100% fiction, visit an American Indian reservation to see how sadly true the lives and stories are.
Thank you Mr. Alexie and I hope to continue to enjoy your writing
