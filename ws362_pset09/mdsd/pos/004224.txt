Many people became aware of Frank Abagnale Jr's story until the movie starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicapprio was released (even though an earlier movie based on this story was released).

While not as flowing as the movie, the story told in this book seems much more realistic and true too life, containing many of Abagnale's earlier mistakes & lessons we  don't get to see in the movie. On the other hand, many parts of it do seem to be missing - such as why Air France would take such an interest in catching Frank, even though the airlines he was cheating seemed to be mostly American based?

This is an interesting read as a background to the movie, and to those who would like to learn what had inspired many of the movie's major storylines
