This book was excellent, written from a fundamental Christian perspective, written in a clear testimony of Christlikeness and brotherly charity. The authors do not go to the extreme of ridiculing the wonderful KJV as some do when they feel defensive. Instead, on a scriptural, logical, even keel they examine the evidence available to us all and the logic of statements made by the KJV-is-inspired claimants. Whether you consider yourself new to all of this discussion regarding texts and manuscripts, etc. or not, you could profit from this book.

I understand the perspective of some folks, who vigorously defend the biblical doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration and authority against modern and postmodern claims that the Bible is man's book. I do too, and so do these authors. But we need not go to the extreme of misunderstanding that not ascribing the work of transcription and translation to divine immediate intervention does not endanger these core, fundamental doctrines. "KJV-only" and "KJV-preferred" should not be a test of orthodoxy
