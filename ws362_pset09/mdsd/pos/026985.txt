I must admit, I took a long time switching to digital for photo work, and then I thought I was set. It appears that not only do a I have to master the camera for settings, but in those instances where the money talks, I have to learn about RAW format rather than the high res JPG format I thought was dealing me a good deal. 

If you shoot professional photography in digital format, you best scurry on down to the local bookstore for this one (or order online d'oph). 

RAW gives you the ground base to build and perfect the data that results in great photographs. Of course you have to be a great photographer to begin with, so that said, this is why professional photographers need this. Alright, its important for photo illustrators too, but if you photographers do not understand why its important to shoot RAW, then the illustator, or yourself cannot do diddly with the jpg in terms of coverting to RAW again.

Must for professional digital photographers and illustrators. Handy for designers dealing with photos. Not relevant to non photo centric people. Printers will have an intrest in this as it relates to client work
