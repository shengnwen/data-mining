Power UNIX and Linux users will want to expand their skills. It's inevitable. Some will get frustrated and drop out and some will work their way through it.

For those who commit to make the transition from power user to system admin, then you will like this book. I don't believe this is the only book a system admin will read or need. But, this is the one you'll go back to over and over.

The author is a system admin herself. She's done the work and continues to do the work. She becomes a partner.

I found this book valuable. I like the publisher and I suggest you will like this book too
