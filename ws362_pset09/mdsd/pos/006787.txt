Since reading Robert Hart's classic book I have seen forest gardens sustaining life in Mexico, Fiji, Australia, South Africa and Britain. Around the world perennial 'home gardens' have been grown for millennia.  Yet in temporate climates we seem to have forgotten how. This book has  inspired me to increase the diversity and productivity of my own small  garden in England, so far with good results. It is inspirational,  but it  is also practical. The Appendices offer suggestions for a variety of uses  and climates. I would recommend as a companion volume, Patrick Whitefield's  'How to Grow a Forest Garden' for further details of the practicalities.  But Hart's desciption of his own forest garden at Wenlock Edge stands alone  and is an invaluable guide to practical sustainability
