My two year old daughter and me thoroughly enjoy reading this book.  I find Carl's responsible behavior with the children to be both silly and endearing.  My daughter constantly finds a different interpretation to each  page of this book with every reading.  My child was not afraid in the  least.  This book is meant to be a thrilling fantasy that every kid (I  believe) dreams about.  Imagine, a big old loveable dog caring for children  while the teacher helplessly watches from the outside.  What child has not  wished this if only for a second.  A marvelous and brilliant execution of  the beauty of a child's mind
