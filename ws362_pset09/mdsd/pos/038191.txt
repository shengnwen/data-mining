I bought this book for my daughter and I guess for me too since I've been a Dr. Seuss fan my whole life.  This book was started by Dr. Seuss, but he never finished it before he died.  It was finished for him.  I like to have it in the collection because Dr. Seuss started it, but also because after the story it shows how the book came about.  It shows Dr. Seuss' sketches that he would have used if he had finished the book and it also shows his thought process in writing the book, the words he wrote and crossed out and different things that he came up with as he tried to get it just the way he wanted it.
