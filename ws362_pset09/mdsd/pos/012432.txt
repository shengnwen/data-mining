I have been looking for cinesthetic book lately. I got this book in amazon used books section. It's about 300 movies (Mostly before 90's)analysis and extracting the 8 basic structures/elements/patterns followed in most of the movies. The explanation is more on theory and anlysis of how they did it. It strictly go by 8 elements author trying to discuss with some movie clips (story boards) and cinesthetics to follow while using this elements. 

Here are 8 basic models of structures:
1)Separation--Fragmentation of scene into single images in alternation--A,B,A,B,A,B etc
2)Parallel Action--Two or more narrative lines running simultaneously and presented by alternation between scenes.
3)Slow Discloser--The gradual introduction of pictorial information with in a single shot, or several
4)Familiar Image-- a stabilizing anchor image periodically reintroduced without variations
5)Moving camera--Used in scenes without cuts
6)Multi-angularity-- a series of shots of contrasting angles and compositions (including reverse and mirror images)
7)Master shot disciplaine--a more traditional, Hollywood film structure
8)Orchestration--The arrangement of the various other elements of structure throghout the film.


I highly recommand this for introductory level of cinesthetics. I could not able to stop reading this book. Go for yours
