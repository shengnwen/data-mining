The heroine of the story is coming to terms with her own understanding of  adulthood in a vile and destructive society.  She had been brought up to  distrust everyone and was trying to work out who she could have as a  friend.  Unfortunately she chooses the wrong person.  The fear that  everyone in Romania felt under the dictator Ceausescu is well shown in this  book.  It was a period when even a bar of chocolate was seen as a luxury.   Children in the UK and in the US will find it hard to believe much of the  story because it is so difficult to imagine not having videos and good  music and burgers and milkshakes.  Remember the orphans of Romania.  Their  lives were literally horrific.  It was better for the children at home with  their parents but not that much better.  A good book with a slightly  unexpected ending.  I wonder did they live happily ever after
