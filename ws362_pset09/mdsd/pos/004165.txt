 This book is awesome. I have had it for about 3 years now,and every time I read it I learn something new. Even the book itself is a conversation starter with its bright orange cover and hologram on the front, but you're friends will really be amazed when they hear about the only albino giraffe or the man with the Devil's toungue.I recommend this book to anyone who likes the Bizzare, for thats what this book is
