I started reading red meat in a weekly free newspaper from New Orleans called the gambit. Every week, I knew that there was going to be one side-splitting laugh on the comics page. Bug-eyed Earl, Milkman Dan and Ted Johnson are some of the best characters I've even come across. The strip looks so wholesome and neat but it is delightfully sick and twisted. This is great stuff, my only regret is that they're only 2 books to buy
