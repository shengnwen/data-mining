Having now read several of John Ortberg's books, I'm starting to get a feel for his style.  His ability to tell an engaging story is unparalleled, and his books are always engaging and easy to read.  "The Life You've Always Wanted" fits neatly into that pattern.

Because the topic of "The Life You've Always Wanted" is some of the traditional Christian spiritual disciplines, it draws natural comparisons to Richard Foster's "Celebration of Discipline."  On some level, it might be fair to consider Ortberg's book to be "An Idiot's Guide to Richard Foster," and I'm not sure that Ortberg would necessarily mind that classification.  Of course, the spiritual disciplines aren't for idiots, and I don't want to imply that Ortberg writes on a superficial level.  However, he has obviously made the decision to write a book that is, quite frankly, more accessible if somewhat less exhaustive than Foster's classic.  As such, Ortberg has added a nice addition to the spiritual disciplines library.

I would happily recommend this book to anyone interested in getting a taste for spiritual disciplines.  Though it's easy to suggest that Ortberg omitted some essential disciplines, it seems as if comprehensiveness was never his intention.  Instead, he appears to have wanted to write something that anyone could read and understand and apply, and he has accomplished that goal.  Though I'd recommend Foster as a next step, this is a great place for any would-be Christ-follower to start!
