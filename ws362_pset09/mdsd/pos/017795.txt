In this book, the latest of the Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, the Full Professor of Romance Philology, Smith reaches into the surreal.  In the first instance, it should be pointed out that a German professor of Romance languages is almost surreal in itself.  The Romance languages, the ones based on Latin such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Rumanian, etc. have no relationship to German at all.  In fact, English is really the combination of German and Latin.

Nonetheless, the good Doctor still exists.  And in this adventure, we see a story in 2 parts.  The first part describes the Professor's 4 month visit to Cambridge.  Smith focuses on the differences between manners, mannerisms, modes of speaking and other idiosyncrasies about England and Germany in relating his story of the Professor's stay at Cambridge.

The second part gets even more interesting as the Professor finally gets the recognition he feels he deserves.  In fact perhaps he gets just a little more recognition than he bargained for when he is taken prisoner by Columbian Guerilla Fighters in the midst of a revolution.  At this point, Smith moves into the dream state of a story unfolding without the protagonist having any control over the outcome.  Yet the outcome is indeed a grand one.

The book is highly recommended to Alexander McCall Smith enthusiasts.  It is also recommended to those who wish to see how academicians sometimes interact with the real world in a very strange manner.
