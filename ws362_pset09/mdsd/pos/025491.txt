  In this first book of the Little Bear series, we are introduced to our innocent hero.  

  Our first story starts by Little Bear telling his mother that he wants something to put on that is fit for the cold.  Mother Bear gives Little Bear a hat.  But when our little protagonist goes outside, he's still cold.  What can mother bear give her son now? A coat, of course.  But,again,Little Bear is still cold.  Finally Mother Bear gives Little Bear pants, but he's still cold.  Then Little Bear asks for a final article of clothing-a fur coat, and after Mother Bear takes off all the clothes she has given him, he realizes he already has one.

  The other two stories-In my opinion-are just as heartwarming as the first.  I found myself grinning after each of the three conclusions.  Minarik's simple text and Sendak's classic drawings make this book the perfect introduction to one of the most loveable characters in children's book history.  A must-have for any parent.
