I had to throw a reference to Finny in there. You can't read about a relentlessly optimistic boarding school sports hero with a leg injury and not think of _A Separate Peace_.

A friend of mine read this for a book club, and she was the only one willing to stand up for Cross. Everyone else thought he was a complete jerk. It just goes to show how absorbing the narrator's negative attitude can be. The reader really has to work to see anything from any point of view but hers.

Of course, once you do the work, you start to see how worthwhile everyone is. I loved all the characters the second time around
