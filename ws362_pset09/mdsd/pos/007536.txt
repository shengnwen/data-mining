I just finished reading Digital Fortress tonight. I must say that I liked it. This is the first book I've read by Brown. I found his writing style to be very readable.

After reading this book, I scanned some of the reviews that had been posted to see what others thought. Some of the reviewers made comments that lead me to believe the writers read the book with skim-for-speed tactics, as their comments did not quite seem to follow all the storyline and character development. I am a read-every-word-don't-want-to-miss-anything reader, and therefore I read slowly.

The only things that stuck out in the book as being very, VERY, odd (to me) were the choice to make the assassin a deaf man and the fact that he used a very expensive silencer on his revolver. I hope everyone knows that silencers don't work on revolvers. Perhaps the assassin did not know that because he was deaf. That about does it for what I consider to be flaws in the book. When I was reading it, some characters did things that seemed inconsistent with the way they had been developed. Nonetheless, Brown brought closure to each character's motivations for their actions - and he did it well.

I have read one of Clancy's NetForce books and I truly enjoyed Digital Fortress more. I have also read several of William Gibson's books and I must say that while very different, Brown's work in Digital Fortress was as enjoyable to me.

Digital Fortress is a good story. It is smooth reading. Give it a try
