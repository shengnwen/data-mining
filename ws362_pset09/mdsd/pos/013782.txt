This book is written for women, which is great because it makes the perfect gift for girl friends.  Every one that I have purchased has been wamly received with laughter and a bit of squeamishness at seeing truth revealed in old and current relationships.  

It is a choose-your-own-adventure-type book.  Starting in the beginning you answer the questions about a relationship honestly and then it tells you what page to turn to, depending on your answer.  It makes for a good time while being informative, since it helps predict the outcome of a new relationship.  It can also help you see problems in past relationships.

This is a great book for women - so if you are one, buy it.  If you're not one, buy it for a friend.  She'll thank you.  :
