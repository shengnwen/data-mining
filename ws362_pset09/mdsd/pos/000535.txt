This novel, written as journal entries and letters, starts in 1903 with a young and naive Miss Mary Mackenzie sailing to China with her chaperone to meet her fiance in Peking where she is to be married.  There she will make a choice which will change the course of her life from anything she might have expected it to be.

This is a rather bitter-sweet story.  It is very well written and gives a great sense of the changes in Asia from 1903 to 1942. Mary is an extremely believable character who must make her away alone, an exile, in what is essentially a man's world - and an alien one at that.  This is not a romance novel and doesn't follow a predictable route to the story conclusion, and yet it is haunting in its way if you follow the story to its end.  If you like a well written historical novel that is set in the 20th century then this is a book you should  pick up, especially as the authors own background in the east means it is full of real details and great feeling for life in China and Japan.
