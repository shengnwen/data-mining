Personally, my favorite gymnast is Olga Korbut.  But I like Nadia , too.  This book was great.  I could really understand why she became successful and superstar.  I like the part Nadia has 10 rules to live by, and she knows the  secret of success since when she was such a young age.  That's very amazing.   Her rules gave me power.  Nadia is a very strong super woman.  However, there are some disappointments , she never talks about her teammate Teodora Ungureanu, who seemed to be her good friend during the 1976 Olympics.  Teodora was also a great gymnast who later was a wonderful and daring circus performer.  She also never talks about amazing gymnast Olga Korbut.   Nadia's performance was perfect (1976 Olympic)  but, I never even noticed  the" Comaneci Salto" until I read about it in her book.  Olga Korbut's back flip on uneven bars and her beam performance, her 1972 floor exercise was much more big impact, artistic, creative and unbelievable performance. Nadia compliments only herself and her coach and her family.   and also compliments Mary Lou Retton ????  what a joke ????  I understand Nadia is not very interested in other performers.  If she was just a litte more humble and  with a sense of  humor, this book could be more fun to read.
