A good compendium of advice for individuals, managers and investors alike, who want to prevent themselves from being hoodwinked by corporate fraud.

I read this book after completing another new book, Wall Street Versus America by Gary Weiss, I think that they compliment each other quite well. The Weiss book has a more muckraking tone and is a swifter read, but this book is stronger in other areas not covered by Weiss.

Definitely a book that needs to be and should be read
