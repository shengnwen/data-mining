I would recommend this read to anyone interested in the Seals or the Teams Training in general.  The 5 1/2 days of hellweek are described day by day, and done so wonderfully.  I would have liked to read more about the rest of the training; however, as the title implies &quot;hell week&quot; is the narrow subject.  I plan on enlisting soon and am tryign to gather as much 1st phase of BUDS information as possible.  This is a good one.  Its also a good read to get you going and motiviated as well
