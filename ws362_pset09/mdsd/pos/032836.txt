Not one of Baldacci's best. The characters are not well fleshed out. But yet it does make for a fast read. 3 1/2 stars, I bumbed it up to four because of the finale.

That being said we have a whistler-blower, Faith Lockhart, who has information that will allow the FBI to put away quite a few Congressmen. Problem is the CIA has been using her boss to gather Intel on these same Congressmen for their own purposes. In steps an unsuspecting Private Investigator who just happens to do everything he can to save Faith. All the while both the FBI and the CIA are seeking them after.

This story has blackmail and plot twist that you will not see coming. But in hindsight you will see they were well developed. The ending of the book is actually pure Baldacci. It is well written and is worth the read.
