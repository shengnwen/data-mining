The Bush family has spent millions projecting an image of 'down home' folks whose only concerns are 'faith' and 'family'. It's a pretty picture, but the authors of this book affirm that it is only an image. They are wolves in sheep clothing. 

Since the days of their association with Hitler, the Bush family is only interested in power. However they get it and however they can keep it is the only thing which really matters to these people. Their obligatory talks about 'morals'...etc are just put in to give the illusion of caring about democracy. If they had their own way, the Bush family would have all of us living under a dictatorship. 

This book is vastly different from most of the anti-Bush texts which flood the market. It eschews cheap shots to instead bring serious evidence against America's reigning monarchy. It also explains how Junior's 'bumblings' are only the more public versions of what daddy did dating back from his job as CIA head. Insteaad of being embarassed...etc the Bush family is actually proud of his actions
