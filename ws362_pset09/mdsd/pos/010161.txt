Some of the stories are better than others.  I liked the last one of the four, &quot;Red Wind&quot; the best.  Chandler wrote amazingly vivid descriptions of people's minute physical actions, their appearances, and physical surroundings.  He painted visually georgeous portraits of crooks, lowlifes, and detectives.   His plots were complex, too.  The Lady in the  Lake is also a beautiful book.  Very high body count in his books and vivid corpses, too.  It's no wonder he's still popular.  Certainly no movie could do his work justice
