I used this book at Cornell's school of Industrial and Labor Relations in an OB course. It was ok, but I have seen better. The examples are mostly revelant, but sometimes it strays from the covered material. A good book to  use to review for the final exam, but if your teacher draws tests from  their own lectures, make sure  you utilize the index in the back
