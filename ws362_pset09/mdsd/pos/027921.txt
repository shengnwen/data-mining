This is an impressive, intelligent and compelling book full of sage advice you won't find anywhere else.  It's like having your very own personal CG  mentor walk you through this fascinating and complex field.  Masson keeps  it interesting, interweaving his personal experience and keen insights.  I  found something useful and surprising in every chapter.  I'm recommending  this wonderful book to my friends
