Some of the facts may not be right but Eddy dishes up some stuff that would cause any Tina fan to read the book cover to cover.  Its like reading the Enquirer - read it just for fun - and fun it is.  Don't take it seriously. One thing is undeniable, pictures don't lie. Tina looks like she was a real party girl in her old days.  But weren't we all, so what. She still survives graciously and gets better even without the protection of her fans.  She didn't need her fan's protection when Ike was pounding on her, so why does she need her fan's protecting her from this piece of prose -not necessary. If she was that upset about this book, I bet her management would have filed suit to have the book removed. Truth is its just more publicity.  Most of us will never know the real Tina so this is just another &quot;story&quot; which is as good as any from someone who was closer to her than any of her fans could ever hope to be. And Tina fans - relax - Tina can take care of herself.  She always has. And think of this, she may not even mind if Eddy made a little money from the book - I believe she is reported to be that generous
