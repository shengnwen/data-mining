This book is Amazing, I have tons of cook books and I use this one the most. Although ginger is used it is in abundance (and I LOVE it) in this book, it is full of dishes with many wonderful herbs, and flavors. The fish recipes are my favorite (such as the ginger miso crusted Halibut, so easy and delicious) but the beef and chicken are also wonderful. Its like going to a very good Chinese restaurant with out clogging your arteries. I hate string beans but loves the String Bean recipe in this book and the Conge is perfect for a cold rainy night
