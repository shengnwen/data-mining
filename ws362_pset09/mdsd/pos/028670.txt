Whether you've been cooking for years and years or a beginner...this is the most educational cookbook I've ever seen. And not only do you learn a lot about the why's and wherefore's about what makes a particular recipe work, but the recipes are GREAT! If I had to go through the 250+ cookbooks I've collected over the years and only got to keep 5, this would definitely make the cut
