King created a world where you believe in the possiblity of people like Carrie White.  He looks at the situations from so many angles that you know everything there is to know and feel thankful for it.  

Its another book that I just couldn't put down.  Reading it was a rewarding experience.

Also, recommended are King's collections of short stories, like Night Shift
