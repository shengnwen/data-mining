I read Making The Corps by Thomas Ricks a long time ago. This is the classic U S Marine Corps recruit  yellow footprints/boot camp/drill instructor/obstacle course/rifle range story. You can't put the book down. Even if you know the story, it is good to hear it again. Buy it. Lately, the quality of the writing of Marine Corps literature has climbed. This book should be sold with One Bullet Away: The Making Of A Marine Officer by Nathaniel Fick. Fick gives us the story of the training a Marine officer candidate receives at Quantico.  Fascinating reading. Fick tells a story that is often hinted at in other books but is rarely told. If you have only one of these books, then you must buy the other. These two books are classic Marine Corps literature. They are both required reading in the Marine library
