I generally make notations and highlight important thoughts when reading a book. Parker Palmer's "Let Your Life Speak" has more notations and highlights in its 109 pages than do most books 2-3 times its length. While the subject - how am I living my life? - is not new, Parker makes the book come alive by presenting old concepts in a new, unfamiliar way. 

The book is derived from essays Parker has published during the past decade. He does not present them as published, but rather he has rewritten them and developed the parts into a coherent whole. 

Chapter 1 challenges the reader to listen to life.
Chapter 2 probes on how we become ourselves. 
Chapter 3 focuses on things of the past (the way closes) and things of the future (the way opens). 
Chapter 4 puts our personal infernos (all the way down) and the path to God into perspective.
Chapter 5 brings the reader to the all-important "Leading from Within."
Chapter 6 uses the metaphor of seasons to relate to the realities of life. 

Some of the thoughts I have highlighted include:

The self wants nothing more, or less, than for us to be who we were created to be - the "True self," (our)true friend...(and) one ignores such friendship at one's peril. 

Burnout is a state of emptiness - trying to give what I do not possess. 

We are led to truth by our weaknesses as well as our strengths. 

The distortion of the true self comes from living from the outside in, rather than from the inside out. 

There are many, many more gems like these to meditate on, to move us, and to help us on the journey to our "True" selves. If you are willing to take the journey within and to discover your "True" self, then this is THE book written especially for you.
