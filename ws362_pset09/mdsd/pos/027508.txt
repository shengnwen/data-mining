Wells provides great source to explore the continuing debate between Darwinism and ID.  Problem is, they really won't debate.

For one huge example which Wells continues to expose but it goes on anyway, the fraud of Haeckel's embryo drawings.  Even Stephen Jay Gould pronounced them fraudulant, and there have been scientific studies which showed the actual photographed embryo comparisons, yet H.S. and college textbooks show Haeckel's chart as "scientific evidence that evolution is factual."  Failure really to engage is the problem here.  They are in control of media and university and most government, so they continue to just scream "God" and separation, and yet fail to engage in scientific evidence being provided.

Consider just this one point which Wells makes:  "Despite centuries of artifical breeding and decades of laboratory experiments, no one has ever observed speciation through variation and selection.  What Darwin claimed is true for all species has not been demonstrated for even one species."

Where's the evidence, Darwinists?

Yet they taut it as fact and refuse to truly engage in debate.  

Get this, read it, use it.
