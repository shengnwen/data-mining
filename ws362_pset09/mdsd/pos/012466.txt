It dose a wonderful job showing how each movement is suppose to be done step by step and showing all the names of each movement. Even if you do not know how to read you can look at the pictures, which show how, do every movement. The one thing I was disappointed the translator did not explain about the expression of each movement such as effacee expression is proud. The expression of each movement is something unique to the Vaganova Syllabus
