I thought this book was a lot of fun, and very informative. We should all be so lucky as to travel the world, and no less, in 80 days but to do it in the past with much difficulty is something else.

The one thing I found confusing was that the author tended to skip arond in their storytelling, but still highly recommended to kids and adult
