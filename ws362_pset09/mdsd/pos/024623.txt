I was just diagnosed with Fibro after fighting the medical profession for 6 of the the 22 years I've had it.  The research cited by Dr. Teitelbaum about hypothalamic and mitochonridal dysfunction at the cellular level make the most sense I've come across.  The info on the nutrients that support various functions in the body and how those of us with CFS/FM aren't able to utilize them the way a normal person would and what to do has allowed me to take control of this illness and help myself rather than groveling before a bunch of MDieties who think if it doesn't show up on a blood test or a scan you're faking it.  While the vitamins can be pricey, I'm finding that if I focus on those that my system needs, it's well worth the cost--when I'm faithful about taking the supplements and living within my limits, I'm starting to feel better. His comments on hypothyroidism fit me to a T--got put on thyroid hormone 'just because' by an Endochronologist who was at a lose as to what to do--my eyebrows started growing back! Only thing I wish he'd mentioned was sleep apnea and CPAP machines--that's the only thing the medical community did right in diagnosing me.
