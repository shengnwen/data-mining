An impressive analysis on contemporary fiction. The breadth of material reviewed is comprehensive and each chapter offers an in-depth analysis of Rebein's particular sub-theme (i.e., &quot;hick chic&quot; or &quot;tribes&quot; etc...). In truth, a lot of these kind of lit-crit analyses can end of being hollow: novels and writers become roadkill on the highway of some critical theory dogma. Rebein actually appears to have enjoyed the work, and the respect for the work or the writer is apparent. Genuine good humor is suffused throughout the book, which is always good to see in literary analysis. The strengths of this study are definitely his discussions on the West, &quot;New&quot; West, and the Western writers given that label: Cormac McCarthy, Erdrich, Kingsolver etc...  His chapter on Cormac McCarthy and his literary cultural mileu is the clearest and sharpest discussion I've read about the work. It's hard to discuss realism and regionalism in general without mentioning the Southern writers and that long history and I found his anaylsis and arguments of Dorothy Allison and her ilk helpful as well. Less compelling for me were the discussions on &quot;Tribe&quot; and minority-American writers he discusses, but the fact that he includes them in his work is a statement in itself. One area I was not well-read in and enjoyed immensely was the &quot;White Prison Novel,&quot; which despite the subject matter sounded like something that would be fun to read. In short, I would have to say that anyone interested in contemporary american fiction or anyone writing contemporary American fiction can learn a lot from this well-considered, comprehensive, and well-written study
