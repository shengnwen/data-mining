This book is a summary of the journal articles by the three authors.  They have done a good job of rewriting them into a coherent, logically flowing book.

The title is misleading as the book deals exclusively with silicon MOS transistors and oscillator types that are suitable for integration including the passive parts.

If you make such circuits, this will be a good book for you.  If you design BJT or JFET oscillators you will not find this book very useful
