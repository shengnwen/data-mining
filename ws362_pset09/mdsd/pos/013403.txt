Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone series of Alphabet mysteries has been a huge seller since its inception in 1982.  I've wanted to read the books for years but didn't for one reason or another.  I finally sat down with the first entry, "A is for Alibi," and plunged into it.  Nikki Fife is a young widow who was recently released from prison; she served eight years for killing her husband.  She insists that she's innocent and hires Kinsey to clear her name.  

Kinsey's first case is interesting and filled with a number of suspects.  It's a solid mystery book.  Kinsey is a likeable protagonist, who has just enough shades of gray and quirks.  She's the kind of lead who doesn't distract too much from the mystery at hand, but she's interesting enough to carry the book.  Grafton's writing is good - straight-forward but filled with nice details.  At times, she spends perhaps a bit too much time describing Nikki and the murder suspects.  However, that's a minor quibble.  I wasn't blown away by "A is for Alibi," but it was good enough that I've already ordered the next entry, "B is for Burglar."
