This book was a great investment. It offers all the basics on every President but also includes the "little things" like what John Adams liked to do in his spare time or how three past Presidents died on the same date (July 4th). I've already marked many pages with my highlighter and post-its. You'll find yourself starting conversations with friends with interesting factoids like how George Washington died (strep throat)
