Massage therapy schools can be lacking when it comes to teaching  developing therapists how to prevent injuries as they develop their skills  and clientele.  This book gives valuable information, exercises, and  instructions to fill in this vitally important area . I strongly recommend  it for anyone who wishes to have a long and pain-free career in the massage  therapy field
