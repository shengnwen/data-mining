After reading Dr. Streissguth's book on fetal alcohol syndrome, I feel this book should be given to every parent or caretaker who receives this diagnosis about their child.  This is the  most thorough book I have found  on this subject.  Dr. Streissguth's knowledge in this area is so extensive  and her book offers a step by step approach and guidelines on what you will  need to know to in raising a child with FAS.  I truly recommend her book  and am so grateful for her insights
