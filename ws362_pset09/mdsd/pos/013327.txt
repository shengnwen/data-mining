Surprisingly, this book is not for creationism but against evolution. Got the difference? It delivers the "incompleteness/impossibility of evolution theory" instead of arguing how intelligent design fits the Bible or what under the sun reveals a designer.

It's chopped into a couple of chapters, each discussing one kind of icons that build up evolution theory. Those icons, described clearly with scientific approach or logical explaining, have been thought the solid evidence of the correctness of Darwinism. The author points out loud that these icons are either fictitious, exaggerated, or misinterpreted by major science field, but are taught universally without authentic information being successfully transfered.

You could read those chapters in look-inside section. Wells probed deep into them and persuasively unveiling the true face behind all these icons. Instead of shattering Darwinism, the messages the book conveys are more like revealing the candid portraits of it. He even suggested some "warnings" be put on in Biology textbook to steer the information right in front of the learners(laymen).

Why I think Wells responsible? Although you could guess he's a creationist, he never tells that evolution cannot be taught. As the subtitle says, he asks for "the right conception" of evolution. Don't fool the public with misled messages! There's still a large bunch of inchoate materials in evolution "theory" while many science big names considered it a fact, ignoring most deficits.

It's a good book to start with in the evolution-or-creation exploration. If you haven't read much of this stuff you would likely to get as stunned as I did. (How biased we've been educated in school!) In the game of human origin search, this book is like a potent player in the 1st quarter.
