Marcus Aurelius' "Meditations" is a celebrated work composed by one of Imperial Rome's most celebrated leaders.  While at times a bit challenging to get through, the most impressive quality of the work is its classic endurance.  Partly a collection of life-lessons and partly a discourse on the psychology of mankind and government, Meditations is as insightful today as it was in ancient Rome.  Overall, an impressive intellectual piece and a good edition to any well-stocked private library.
