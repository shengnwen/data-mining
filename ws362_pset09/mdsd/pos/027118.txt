I am baffled as to why Linda Barnes is not at the top of every mystery lover's list. Her character, Carlotta Carlyle, is like a blend of Kinsey Millhone and Stephanie Plum -- she's got chutzpah when it's needed, but there are some soft edges to her, too. Barnes' stories are impeccably plotted with just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end. And her writing is smooth and fresh.

"Deep Pockets," the tenth in the series, is as complete a mystery package as anyone could hope for. All the quirky characters from previous novels (Leroy, Paolina, Sam, Roz, and more) make their appearances, and we get to see Carlotta continue to wrestle with her never-ending attraction to Sam. The relationship between Carlotta and her adopted little sister, Paolina, also matures. I appreciate how Barnes keeps these relationships growing and changing instead of letting them stagnate as mere backdrops to the storyline. 

If you like Grafton, Paretsky, Muller, or Dunlap, try Barnes. You'll love her.
