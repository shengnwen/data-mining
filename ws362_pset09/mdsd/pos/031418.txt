I truely enjoyed reading the series and actually hate to have reached the end. I am blessed to see the reviews of other christians who enjoyed the series as much as I did. This book was straight from the Bible and painted a picture in my mind of what the glorious appearing could be like. I think Rayford should have spent more time with Kenny rather than he being put off on others especially after his "job" was done. I also wish there would have been more to the reunions at the end, it focused on Rayfords family but I think there would have been more to it that what is written. Overall I love this series and hope they do make more movies based on the books. God Bless
