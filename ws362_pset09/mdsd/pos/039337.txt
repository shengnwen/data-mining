This is an excellent Bible particulary for folks of the Reformed/Presbyterian Tradition. The stories are told using real images and language -- it's not sugar-coated nor is the theology compromised by using a slightly elementary vocabulary. The illustrations are vivid and hold attention -- all in all, it's an excellent family Bible
