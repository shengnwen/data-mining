It's good to have red-baiting reviewers like Kevin Bowman to prove Robert Coover's point a half-century after the Rosenbergs died and nearly thirty years after his book appeared.  Gee, even an evil intellectual ("vindictive college professor") turns up in Kevin's review.  Talk about fully-formed characters.

It's a great book.  You don't have to agree with the politics.  There are parts where Coover goes way over the top, as you might expect with any 800 pound gorilla of a novel like this.  It's true, it is a little "sophomoric" sometimes.  It's profound more often, though, and not just because Coover takes potshots at Luce's Time Magazine.

Seriously, this is an unjustly ignored masterpiece.  Let's hope there are more vindictive college professors out there
