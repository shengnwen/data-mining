I started attending a Beyond Wealth program a few months back and started to get my self to financial freedom. At the program I was gifted two books Becoming a Billionaire God's Way and Think like a billionaire. I have read both these books and my life was changed I was able to change my thinking to bring myself out of financial debt and into financial freedom. Then I wanted to continue to grow in abundance so I read Rich Dad Poor Dad, after reading this book I felt I had an even better grasp on my finances but it wasn't until I read The Six- Day Financial Makeover when I finally felt extrememly confident about our finance. THis book lays things out in ways that will you allow to totally understand why you are needing to change what you are doing with your money to maximize your money. I strongly suggest this book to all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
