The characters are Tom, a Navy seal specializing is counter terroism home on medical leave visiting his uncle, and Kally, a big-city doctor caring for her terminally ill father.  Sounds like a typical match for a romance novel, but this novel is so much more than that.  Kelly and Tom have a past, but her father and his uncle has an even bigger past.  All four of them have to draw on their pasts to protect the futures of themselves and many others.  Many long kept secrets must be bared and all their hearts must mend.

I think I have yet another author to add to my favorite list.  This novel not only has a suspensful, gripping plot, but is packed with romance, and excitment on many levels.  Most romance novels are only about two people with various cameo appearances by several others.  Not so, with this one.  There are four different stories wrapped eloquently into one novel, and expertly blended to create the whole.  The reader is kept guessing and there are surprises around evey turn.  Some are pleasant and some sad.  This is truly a moving tale on all levels.  You won 't be dissapointed
