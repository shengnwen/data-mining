MW and TH are one of the greatest story tellers I've ever read about.. The Chronicles trilogy will probably one day be considered as the greatest epic trilogy ever written.. 
This book is my favorite mainly because of the courage and bravery of Sturm Brightblade..He knew he would die but did his duty without question..Kitiara knew she had to fight him and there was no turning back..Two characters who were probably my favorite duo at one time were friends,then lovers,then turned to becoming enemies.. Of course the story didn't revolve just around Kit and Sturm,it just happened to be my favorite part of the book.
