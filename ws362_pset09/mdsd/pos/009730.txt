I found the book to be odd, amusing, and sad in classic Irving fashion.  I really liked this book.  I didn't love it the way I did "A Widow for One Year" or "A Prayer for Owen Meany," but I was compelled throughout the book to its finish.  The final act of the book is so lovely.  Maybe I was so moved because I had read of John Irving's plight with his own father, but this ending literally left me in tears and has stuck with me in the months since I read it.  Maybe not the best Irving book to start with, but I think this book nicely compliments his collection
