14 year old john and his father's crew sail the foreign areas. one dark night they are lead by false lights and crash. The area they crash on are evil families that steal the dead's possesions. i recomend this book for all ages. its a great book on a rainy day to read. this book is not perfect but it is worthwhile to try.
