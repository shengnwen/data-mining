I had the blessed chance to meet Diane Skafte and found her to be such a warm and spiritual woman.  She has the air of some ancient prophetess herself; which made her book all the better.  The best parts of this book is Skafte's imagining of what an ancient scene would look like (for example--what a petioner to the Oracle might think or experience before, during, and after their oracular experience).  She helped me see that God and the &quot;gods&quot; speak to us all the time through various means.  The only thing keeping me from giving her book the full 5 stars, is it begins to bog down toward the end as she gets muddled in left-wing environmentalism.  But overall, a good book
