	This book is about a girl named Morgan. Her best friend  Jason Harding kills himself and Morgan and two of kids from her school named Seth and Grace all go into a suicide pact were they are going to kill themselves but you will have to read to find out to see if they kill themselves.
	Some things I liked and didn't like about this book. A few things I likes was how they talked about how everyone was feeling. They explained how they were dealing with their problems. A few things that I didn't like about the book was how they didn't let Jason be in the story so we could see some of his problems he had in life that made him want to kill himself.
	I would recommend this book to teens that like suspension and thrill of seeing what will happen next. This book isn't really similar to any of the other books that I have read but it is an amazing story that gives you details on things that may happen in life. I encourage you to read this book and the whole series the one's that I have read are really good.
