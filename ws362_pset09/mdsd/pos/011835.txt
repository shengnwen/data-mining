Failure is not an option...

FBI special agent Dave Richman has spent his life protecting people; failure is not in his vocabulary. He'll figure out a way to protect Kate even is she is determined to make it difficult.

Failure means somebody dies...

Kate O'Malley's speciality is hostage situations--defusing human time bombs before they go off. She will walk into the middle of a crisis if that's what is necessary to settle a situation. She's learned to let others see what she wants them to see. She's learned to depend on herself. Only herself. People die if she fails.

Failure is what someone wants...

Kate is a target. Someone's been sending her black roses. Maybe the same person who just blew up an airplane...and blamed Kate. Then the investigation brings up the name Kate hoped never to hear again...and she's faced with the shocking evidence that the bomber may be someone she knows. Now she has to decide if Dave-and the God he trusts so implicity-is all he's supposed to be. And Dave is about to discover that loving a hostage negotiator is one thing, but keeping her safe is anothor matter entirely..
