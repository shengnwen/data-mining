At first, I did not know how seriously to take this book. It seemed like an elaborate prank. However gradually upon reading it, I realised that the author is deadly earnest. It is a sociological analysis of the episodes of Dynasty, as viewed on Norwegian television. But, and this is the significant point, it is also a co-analysis of the reaction of those episodes on the Norwegian audience. 

It should be made clear that the book is not some fluffy tabloid precis of the show. Gripsrud expertly dissects the role of the prime time soap opera, using Dynasty as the case study. 

If you are an American who watched the original episodes in the US, then this book might be a fascinating twisted perspective
