...with a very good tour guide.  As the title suggests, it is a very short introduction.  Prof. Craig gives an excellent introduction to the three big questions "What should I do?" (or how should I live my life?) "How do we know?"(very roughly, how do we draw conclusions? "What am I?" (again, very roughly, what is a person?)  After dealing with these Prof. Craig then moves on to several other issues, all of which relate back to these questions.

Prof. Craig is a delightful guide, full of good humour and, for the most part, a fantastic explainer of very complex ideas; you'll have to read his description of Nietzsche's ideas to see what I mean.  His annotated bibliography is definitely one of the best I have come across in this series.

Why four stars?  I'd give him four and a half if I could.  The only minor shortcomings of the book were that one or two of the explanations weren't all that clear (but then, it is a very short guide) and I found his treatment of C. S. Lewis bordering on contemptuous.

Those points aside, a fantastic book.
