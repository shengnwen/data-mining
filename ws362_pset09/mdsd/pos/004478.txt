We have no choice but to listen to this CD each time we get in the car. Our son's first words are "Spanish CD"! He loves it and has learned so many words and phrases like "hace frio". I love how well it teaches him and my dh and I love it as well. We have honed our Spanish skills as well. We just ordered the Magic Spanish from Beth Manners and can't wait to learn more!
