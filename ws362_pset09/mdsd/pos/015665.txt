A book filled with recipes and the passages from the books that inspired their creation.

Shaunda Kennedy Wenger is a writer and food lover. Her work has appeared in numerous publications. Her first children's book is about to be published by Richard Owens Publishers. She is also currently writing her first novel, which also contains recipes. Although originally from New Hampshire, she currently resides in Utah with her husband and three children.

Janet Kay Jensen is a speech pathologist. She is a published writer and has won numerous awards. She lives in Utah with her husband and is the mother of three children. She is currently working on her first novel.

This book is filled with over 200 recipes, all inspired by passages in books. There are no photographs in this book, as all book lovers need is an imagination! Some of the exciting chapters contained within this book are: Breakfasts; Main and Side Dishes; Soups; Salads; Appetizers, Breads and Other Finger Foods; Desserts; and, Cookies and Other Sweets.

As a person who enjoys cooking first, and then reading, I found the recipes were mediocre. I think this was a difficult task for the authors, but some of the recipes, I didn't quite imagine that their interpretation of the passage equalled the resulting recipe. I feel like this book is really for, as the title indicates, a book lover's cookbook. 

There are some interesting recipes, such as "A King's Bean Salad" inspired by "Little House on the Prairie" by Laura Ingalls Wilder and "Pippi's Orange-Cranberry Muffins" inspired by "Pippi Longstocking" by Astrid Lindgren.

This is a good book that is an excellent gift idea for book lovers that love to cook
