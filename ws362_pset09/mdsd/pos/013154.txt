The Savory Way by Deborah Madison is a vegetarian cookbook that focuses on flavorful, interesting dishes.  The few I have tried have turned out well, but there are some caveats to the book.  First, Madison relies heavily on very fresh and hard-to-get ingredients, which is great but not very practical if you don't have a big herb and vegetable garden in your yard.  Second, although the directions are complete, she does assume that she is writing for &quot;intermediate&quot; or advanced cooks.  Beginners might be confused as to appropriate end points to some of the steps.  Third, this is not the cookbood for you if you are new to vegetarian cooking or simply cooking a lot of vegetables.  For example, there are only two recipes for fresh asparagus and no instruction on the basics of cooking any vegetable (I'm sure that is her other cookbook).  If you want some specialty, delicious vegetarian recipes for any meal or course, this is a good cookbook.  For basic vegetarian cooking, you should look elsewhere
