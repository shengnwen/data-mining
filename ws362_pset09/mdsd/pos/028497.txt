The first thing that struck me about this book was that it was written in third person not in a first person perspective.  Therefore it reads somewhat like a novel.

The story is set on the eastern front and centers on Josef "Sepp" Allerberge, who after being wounded and required to sort weapons during his recovery finds a Russian sniper rifle and attempts to get out of the role of machine gunner, which provided only a short life expectancy for the soldier in that position. He proves himself enough to be given a chance and the story begins.

The book gives a great overview of the life and craft of a German sniper and all that that entails...from a sense of the technical aspects to the evolution of emotions between the German and Russian solidiers.  You begin to see how a soldier in that atmosphere begins to change and harden to protect himself and deal with all the chaos and carnage going on around him.

The only complaint I had with the book was that I wish it had been a bit more detailed.  However, that is a slight complaint.  It is an easy to ready book that a reader who is interested in the subject matter will fly through in a short amount of time
