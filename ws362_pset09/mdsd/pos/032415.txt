I've never written a review here however I need to say that I LOVE Miss Anne.  I love this book. I love ALL of her books & every single one takes me to a different place within myself.  She has the ability to show me, in living color, her imagination, her stories & it becomes real while I'm reading her work. Heck, I keep thinking about many of her books long after I've read them & reread them every few years. 

There are very few authors I'll buy hardback at full price, but she is so worth it.  I'm actually scared about the day she retires & I won't get to see the world through her eyes anymore.   She, Pat Conroy, Andrew Greeley, Chaim Potok, Alice Hoffman & in the past few years, Dorothea Benton Frank & Laurie King, are by far my Hardback paying, run to the bookstore, refusing to lend (but will buy for others of course because they HAVE to experience these journey's), compulsive rereading favorite authors that are still writing & feeding my addiction. (OK, Chaim Potok died, but I still reread his stuff & give it to people to read).  

Anyway, the woman can write.  She rocks.  It say's so on the T-shirt, don't ya'know?
