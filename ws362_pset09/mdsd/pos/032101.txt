I bought this guide two months before my travel to Buenos Aires. I studied it and marked all interesting places in the city. Later in the Hotel I asked for a map (It was free)and marked all the interesting places.

The guide shows wonderfull places to go, beautifull monuments, good restaurants and coffee shops.

Don?t pay attention to prices in the guide, devaluation has changed everthing, You must know 1 US Dollar is equivalent to 3 or 3 Pesos. Also you can change Brasilian Reales, Euros, and Pounds. Example A Water Bottle is worth about 1.20 Pesos, a gooood and juicy Steak is worth 16 pesos. A Taxi is worth about 6 or 10 pesos. The guide say you could spent almost 60 US $ Day, I think it?s abou 45 US $ day. 

Try central hotels, near "Teatro Colon" or Galerias Pacifico Shoping Center.

Conclusion: It?s a nice guide, but you will need better maps.
