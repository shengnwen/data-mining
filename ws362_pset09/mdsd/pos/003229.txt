The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era.  It was wonderfully told and beautifully written.
