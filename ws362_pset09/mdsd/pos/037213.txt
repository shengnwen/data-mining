Not only is the story itself quite clever but the music notes in the growing tree are also quite well chosen.  When Mole begins to play the violin the music that is produced on the tree is what almost every beginner learns to play, "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star".  The music of Brahms and Beethoven are illustrated in the tree throughout the book.  When the soldiers first stop at the tree, the notes are from Beethoven's 6th Symphony,"The Pastoral".  When the soldiers drop their weapons and shake hands, Mole is playing "Ode to Joy" from Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  And what better way to go to sleep than to Brahms' Lullaby, shown on the very last page as Mole goes to sleep.  A wonderful book for adults and children
