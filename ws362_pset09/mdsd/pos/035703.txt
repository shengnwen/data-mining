Although this is structured as a business book, it gives insights into how we deal with all the areas and people in our lives.  It really helped me open myself to other ways of dealing with difficult situations.  Also, although it is a business book, it is a 'light' read and enjoyable.  Highly recommended to all my family and colleagues
