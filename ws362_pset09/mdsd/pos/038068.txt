"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa" is the most accessible, personable, down to earth literature I have read about ancestor and deity reverence.  Tobe Melora Correal inspires self examination and shares insights from her journey of discovering the authentic self; and does so respecting the diversity and readiness of the reader.  Healthy skepticism is praised and viewed as an asset/tool with regard to power inbalance and struggles, making choices about what or whom to follow specific to self, individuals, collectives and communities that practice ancestor reverence and/or Orisa worship. Her naming patriarchy and acknowledging the power of men and women alike as balance and being in alignment with the soul on the path of Orisa is at the helm of this timely work of spiritual food.  All is valuable.  'True soul can only be found when much of what our spiritual selves have to offer is anticipated, nurtured and valued.' Thank you Tobe Melora Correal for this book, a tool that I can pick up, read again and again, for guidance, validation and celebration of authenticity and reverence of those who paved the way for us on our paths.  Praise to your ancestors, they are indeed smiling.  Peace and Blessings
