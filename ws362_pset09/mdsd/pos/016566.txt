I found this book to be a great resource on long term food storage, but I gave it 4-stars since I didn't think it gave enough attention to other areas in this emerging area.  Written in 2002, it provides its information taking terrorism into consideration, which is definitely a positive.  I think the book could be updated to include preparedness skills for pandemic flu threats and other emerging issues, but this is a minor criticism.  All in all, the book is probably one of the best sources for practical information on food and water storage and general survival skills.  The resource list at the end is worth the price of the book.  I also appreciated the fact that the author realized that budget considerations are important in this area and that not everyone can afford to buy thousands of dollars worth of freeze dried foods
