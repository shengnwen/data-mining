I really liked this book because it was historical and gave all the sources.  I particularly liked the section where Professor Bruce documented Jews claiming to have killed Jesus Christ -- Jewish Talmud and other Jewish sources take credit for Jews killing Christ Jesus.  Anyone who doubts that Jews killed Jesus Christ is refusing to take Jewish documents from the ancient world seriously
