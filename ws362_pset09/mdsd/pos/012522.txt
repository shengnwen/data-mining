I've heard it said that "there is no such thing as the truth, there are only stories".  Alan Gettis Seven Times Down, Eight Times Up is a masterful collection of stories that points beautifully to the universal truths that surround us.  His easy going style never gets in the way.  The books loving paternal nature delivers lessons that can be read over and over again, gleaning new insights with each re-reading.  It is the kind of book you like to leave around the house for a quick spiritual boost. Each of the stories stands like a sparkling gem through which the truth is magnified and humanized. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves learning in its most powerful form, through story.
