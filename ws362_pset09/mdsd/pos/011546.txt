^Legends^ presents original stories from the best writers of fantasy literature. George R.R. Martin's &quot;A Hedge Knight&quot; is a must read for anyone who enjoys his &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series (which should be everyone). Orson Scott Card's &quot;A Grinning Man&quot; is a gem that surely will put a smile on your face. It should be a law: Writers this gifted need to publish a new novella every year
