This book is very informative, but the author's style of writing is very, very dry!  It was very difficult for everybody, teacher included, in my Lit&Psych class to read through more than one chapter at a time.  I would not recommend this book for leisure reading.  Despite its downfalls, this book is a great way to get a broad overview of Freud's theories condensed into one small, inexpensive, light-weight package
