I've only read two of his books. Skinny Dip is the other one. This book is just hard to put down. You laugh the whole way through it, and you can't wait to see what happens next. And the ending is nice. I can't say too much about the book - it is a great read. I suspect Dave Barry got some lessons from Carl. His books are similar-just plain funny. Hiaasen comes up with great characters and develops them well in the books. You know these people at the end. And the bad guys get what's due them. The language might be too much for a movie, but I am surprised there is not a movie of Lucky You (maybe there is). 
For what is worth, he gets five stars from me.
