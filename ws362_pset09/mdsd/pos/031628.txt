This was a very interesting book on a very interesting group of people.  Nanda did a superb job of describing the Hijras in the context of Indian society.  The personal accounts of individual Hijras added a great  perspective.  My one problem with this book is that throughout, while  striving to show the validity of the concept of more than two genders,  Nanda gave the impression that she feels that the Western cultural concept  of gender dichotomy is backward and naive.  To me, this felt like an attack  on Western culture, which I do not look for in supposedly unbiased  ethnographies
