This is a book meant to be read aloud!  The ryhthm and cadence of each story is a wonderful word salad ready to be heard by children of all ages.  I bought this for my daughter when she was quite young (about 6 months), and we still read, laugh, and enjoy it after several years.  About the only thing I do not like, as another reviewer also noted, is the use of the word "turd" in one of the stories.  However, the cleverness and overall wit of the stories makes up for it.  Each story has a magical rhythm that you can only tap into by reading aloud.  It is wonderful for younger children because they learn invaluable language skills.  It is wonderful for primary children because they learn how to play with language.  I highly recommend this book
