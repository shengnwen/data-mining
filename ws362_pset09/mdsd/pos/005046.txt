Sommers and Satel's thesis, which I find indisputable no matter what your politics, is that the therapy industry, driven by the human potential movement and making big bucks, has contributed largely to our nation's weakening psyche: We have become a bunch of over-sensitive cry-babies full of entitlement, divorced from common sense and self-reliance. What's really frightening is the manner in which the authors have put our therapy-numbed brains in the context of a post 9/11 world, a time in which we need to be tougher and more street-smart than ever. Woefully though, too many of us are still seduced by the fraud of  the "fragile inner child," the cult of self-esteem, the obsession with removing morality and character in the name of "syndromes." 

The most salient point is the hiring of grief counselors to help people cope with the aftermath of 9/11. The rest of the world must be laughing at us for seeing the war against us as a matter of grief counseling. How dangerously weak we've become. One Nation Under Therapy is a bracing wake-up call
