Doctors and clinical professors at the UCLA School of Medicine, Arthur L. Wisot and David R. Meldrum have expertly collaborated to create a comprehensive and thoroughly "reader friendly" 360-page introductory guide to In Vitro Fertilization and other assisted reprouction techniques. Intended especially to educate those considering such fertility procedures, Conceptions & Misconceptions covers common causes of infertility, tests that infertile couples seeking treatment need to undergo, the risks and preparations needed for multiple births, alternative treatments for infertility, and much more. A straightforward, down-to-earth "must-read" for any couple seeking information on this often difficult or painful subject.
