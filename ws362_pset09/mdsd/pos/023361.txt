As our characters enter in to the second half of the Tribulation, Satan takes possession of Carpathia, as predicted in the book of Revelations. It took forever in the book for it to actually happen though. The book picks up right at the end of #6, Assassins, where Carpathia is killed, and the entire scope of book 7 encompasses not much more than three days. 

As followers stream in from all over the world for Carpathia's over-the-top funeral, his closest advisors try to figure out who killed Carpathia. The authors will take readers on quite a trail as they try to guess who really did it. I figured it out almost immediately, but it was interesting to follow the different threads throughout hinting at different possibilities. 

However, it seemed a long book to get through three days if you ask me, but I'll keep reading. I've gone too far to stop now!
