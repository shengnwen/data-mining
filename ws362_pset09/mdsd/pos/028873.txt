Rudyard Kipling is famous as the first English winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. He won that at the young age of just 42, in 1907. He had made a career as a journalist and writer working in India and England. His main strength was the short story.

The present book - a Penguin Classic - is not a literary masterpiece. This is a 200 page story aimed at a reader - who I suspect - would be a teenage boy or similar. It is a story about how a young boy, Harvey, falls overboard on an Atlantic crossing from a cruise ship that sailed from New York. He is rescued by a fishing boat that is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Most of the story - for about 125 of the 200 pages - is about Harvey and another boy, named Dan, who he meets on the fishing boat. Harvey has lead a pampered life, but undergoes some character building as a result of the accident and then his time on the fishing boat, helping catch and clean the fish.

Later, Harvey bonds with his parents.

This is not a great novel by a Nobel prize winner, and if you are expecting a masterpiece in literature you will be disappointed; but, it is a short introduction to the writing of Kipling, and most teenage readers will enjoy the book. As an adult, I thought it a bit slow in the middle, and I was not too excited about the use of so much colloquial English. 

It reminds me of a "Hardy Boys" novel for teenage boys, or younger
