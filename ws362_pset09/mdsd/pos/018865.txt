This book is broken up into sections based on how long it takes to do the projects (shortest, 30 min. and longest a weekend). I thought they would take longer but the time estimates were right on target for the projects I tried. The good thing about this book is a lot of the projects teach techniques that you can use to make other stuff, rather than just copying a design or pattern
