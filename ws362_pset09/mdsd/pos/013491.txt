Unlike the Left Behind series, Beauseigneur's depiction of the end times is presented in a way that is wholly plausable.  Evil is shown as it truly is; subtle, bait & switch. His scientific explanations of the disasters as described in the Book of Revelation remove the mystery and show that yes, this can happen just as the Apostle John said it would.  I recommend all three books in the series
