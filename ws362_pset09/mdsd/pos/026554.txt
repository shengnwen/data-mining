I thought the book was good.  I think I give it four stars because I'm such an Eric Davis fan.  It is interesting finding out who ED feels are/were the great ones of the game (and he certainly has no problem  including himself in subtle, yet frequent references).  Still, even with  the typos, run-ons, and repetitive sentences, I reccomend it for any Reds  fan.  You gotta tip your cap to the man and what he has overcome and still  play the game (and well).  ED will always be one of those guys you have to  watch when he's at bat because if you don't, you just might miss something  great
