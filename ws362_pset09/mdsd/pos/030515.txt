I have read many concise history texts, and this is far and away the best one I've come across. Mr. Roberts communicates all the major events in history without confusing the reader with too many details. He does more then tell you what happened, and  when it happened, he explains why and what impact it has on us today. This is a book that every citizen should read and a great introduction for young scholars just cutting their teeth on history. It would make a great text for a freshman level general history course, or for high achieving high schoolers
