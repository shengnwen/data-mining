I read this story with my 11 year old daughter and she really liked it, which I think is more important that whether or not I liked it.  The idea of book characters having lives beyond the story in which they live is nicely done and I very much like that Princess Sylvie is strong and thinks outside the written confines of her part in the story.  Others have noted that most of the characters are flat and not well developed.  In my view, that is one of the story's themes.  They are underdeveloped, because they cannot think beyond the lines written for them. Princess Sylvie can, which makes her unique.  Overall, a very good book and I very much recommend it
