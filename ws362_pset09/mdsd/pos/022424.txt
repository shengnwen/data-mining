A thoroughly enchanting yarn. The story of 2 brothers fixing, then flying a small Piper cub across the US during one of their teenage summers. Told with a zest for adventure, and a great sense of humor.

One of the best parts of the story is Buck's colorful use of language. When talking about how his father had to keep turning a plane back and forth to land in a crosswind, he talks of the plane "jackassing" its way up the strip. Similarly with his tale of "Hank the Stearman man" and the other pilots in East Richmond, Indiana.

The pictures give the book a real scrapbook feel to it, and make things feel more real. (As if Buck's use of language weren't enough!)

The book can tend to get over-scmaltzy at times, but the author can be forgiven that, esp. given his obvious affection for the subject matter.

The ending chapters serve to cement the nostalgic feel of a "bygone" era, which makes one a little sad for its passing. However, this does not diminish the book; rather it made me treasure it all the more
