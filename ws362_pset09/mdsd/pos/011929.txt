This book is recognized as a classical worldwide. Indeed, it is the most comprehensive book on wave propagation, diffraction, and scattering to be found nowadays over 20 years after it was written. No wander it is referred to as &quot;the bible&quot; of electromagnetics.  It is a must for any one in the business of electromagnetics, analytical or numerical and it is the only book I own that is frequently used both for research and as a graduate course textbook
