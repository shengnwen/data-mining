This is a sobering, inspiring book. Duncombe shows us the boundless potential of zines and zine culture. At the same time he diagnoses the failure of zines to reach out and become relevant to people outside our  little &quot;underground&quot;. All the effort and enthusiasm that we pour  into zines is a small revolution, but if we all joined forces and poured  that effort into a movement, we could truly change the system rather than  just complaining and waging futile rebellion against it. This book should  be required for any would-be revolutionaries, punks, zine creators, and  thinking human beings
