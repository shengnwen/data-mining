After reading this book for a college class, my heart just broke for the Native American Indians and how they were treated, assulted, and driven off their land. They walked that long winding trail and died by the thousands. Families were separated, divided, and death took a lot of the natives. This book is very informative containing the facts and details of the early history and leading up to to the removal of the Indians. the book grabs you and it seems to put you right there as it unfolds
