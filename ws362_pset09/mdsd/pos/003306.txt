My four-year-old nephew is so into elevators that he asked for one for Christmas!  Luckily, we found this book.  The fact that it helps teach subtraction is a bonus.  The main thing that our nephew likes about it is that it shows the elevator button panel on many pages (that's his favorite part of the elevator).
