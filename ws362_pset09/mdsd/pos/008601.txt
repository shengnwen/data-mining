This book is controversial, but it is actually pretty good. If you can get beyond some of the surface-level disagreements you might have with Mr. Pollan, you will find his work insightful and that you agree with him more than you disagree with him.

I enjoyed the read. I liked the "theory" part of the book better than the "pratical" part. I wish he had made the "theory" part a bit longer.

I don't agree with everything that the author says, but I can't discount the value of the book. It is worth a read and will give you some real good advice without sentimental fluff. 

Of course, this book is a career-oriented book, so if you are looking how to "live rich" religiously, philosophically, metaphysically, or whatever, look elsewhere. Most criticisms of Mr. Pollan's viewpoint on money is because the people criticizing his work are coming from a metaphysical or spiritual angle, while this book merely instructs on how to live richly in sense of a career. And he does that make it clear throughout the book (in telling people to use their career to get money and their other aspects of life to get other things).

I guess someone may accuse Mr. Pollan of advocating overly strict  compartmentalisation of life. I can understand that point of view. Even if you are against Mr. Pollan's ideas in this sense, I suggest you still read this book. It will challenge you and is especially good for entreprenuers, who often get too involved in making their business big and "successful" without remembering about the bottom line--for them. This book is worthwhile on that account alone
