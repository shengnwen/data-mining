The scenarios in this book seem to go on and on..there's always a picture I didn't notice before.  This is an excellent book for picking out individual objects from a busy scene, matching, storytelling.  I like how  it offers a lot of verbs and shows them in action instead of only nouns.   The illustrations are fun, creative and lively. This is my 22 mo. old  daughter's favorite book since the day she got it
