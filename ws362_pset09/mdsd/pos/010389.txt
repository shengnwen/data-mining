This highly academic treatment of the Middle East provides more detail than most readers, or at least this reader, can easily digest. Lewis is more organized than is evident from the text, the table of contents, or any other clear signal, but the he leaves the reader more burdened than most authors to discover this organization. On casual reading, much of the text appears to be a stream-of-consciousness string of comments with no underlying organization. I suspect this is largely true, but an attentive reader can find themes within the text (slavery, development of the law, the institution of church vs. religion, etc.). Unfortunately, these do not correspond to chapter or subchapter titles, are not entirely contiguous (several topics are reintroduced several times), and, if there is any overall framework to their organization, it has escaped me. Nevertheless, the discussion appears accurate, balanced, and insightful. In particular, the discussion is both respectful of the customs of the Middle East while appropriately honest and critical in its presentation. As an academic discussion, it succeeds. However, the text lacks any sense of story telling, anticipation, or humor that help maintain a reader's interest. It will be a difficult read for those who look to the text for motivation, but for those externally motivated to learn of the Middle East and looking for a good reference, it is an excellent place to start
