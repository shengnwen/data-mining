This is one of my all time favorite books. It's a journal that spans years, with thoughts that are illuminating. Not a book to be read cover to cover, it's a companion in a journey, and it will spark the light of truth  in you...it's certainly added to my life and growth, for which I'm  thankful. No one is perfect, and Kerouac never claimed to be. This is a  record of his struggle and search for enlightenment. Should those who judge  his method and life ever attain 10% of what this man achieved, it will  surprise me. &quot;The Book of Pure Truth consists of a bunch of mirrors  bound in a volume&quot;. You tell 'em Jack
