This is an insightful examination of Welch's management principles, initiatives and strategies that will be valuable to anyone in business. It sheds light on the origin, evolution, implementation and significance of Welch's signature initiatives and concepts--such as &quot;#1, #2,&quot; &quot;fix, close or sell,&quot; boundaryless, the four E's of leadership, globalization, Six Sigma, the learning organization and more--and explains how he turned GE into a global powerhouse. It also shows how managers can apply Welch's methods to their own businesses. Jeffrey Krames has done an outstanding job of capturing the mindset and seminal ideas of one of history's most successful CEOs. Highly recommended
