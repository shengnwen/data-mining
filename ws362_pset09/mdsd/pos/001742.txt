I found Doug Thorburns books extremely helpful. How to spot Hidden Alcoholics was particularly so. For a lay person as myself I was having a difficult time recognizing alcoholism with 2 people in my life. My sister and my significant other. These books taught me about this disease that was affecting my life and the life of my loved ones. Having no experience with alcoholism and what truly constitutes it or not. Hidden Alcoholics opened my eyes. I found myself repeatedly saying; "yes, that is what was happening". Before I read them I was both in denial about the situation and actually an enabler. After reading them I was empowered to confront the situation in my life and combat it with intelligent knowledge. I highly recommend this book, and Doug's others for everyone who needs his experience and knowledge to educate themselves.
