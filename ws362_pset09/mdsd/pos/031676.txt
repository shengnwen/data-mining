Of course it deserves five stars because of the great author, knowledge of Chinese Culture, good characters and wonderful story. It involves the delicate balance between the old Chinese customs of ancient medicine vs science, the choosing of ones own mate vs the old custom of parents making the choice.  In this case, the family is not peasant but prominent, but the culture just as interesting.  There is no action in this book but more of a love story.  No peasants trying to survive in poverty but a cast of the entitled and a struggle of wills.
