This book is an excellent introduction to the formalist approach literary criticism.  In formalist approaches, the text is analyzed according to the form it takes and the way discourse is constructed.  It is a text-centered approach as opposed to a reader-centered approach, which is also mentioned in this book.  No academic book of literary criticism can be published today without the mention of Foucault, Derrida, and Lacan (regardless of their merrit).  This book is no exception, and in a sense tries to harmonize their ideas with earlier formalism.  The underlying utility of this book is in three areas:

Learning the concepts - the fundamental concepts for analysis of narrative are presented in a systematic way.

Learning the jargon - literary criticism today is laced with jagon, which is what makes contemporary literary criticism impenetrable to the initiated.  The book is repleat with all the technical terms necessary to analyze narrative.

Learning to analyze the text - selections of literary works are presented and then analyzed for their narrative structure.  In that way, a student is able to see how concepts are applied.

Formalism is currently out of fashion in contemporary academic literary criticsm, however, as the author makes clear, without the fundamental tools for analyzing structure and discourse, and a vocabulary (jargon) for conveying the structure, other forms of criticism like feminist criticism or postcolonialist criticism lack rigor.

I recommend this text to the advanced student of literature at the upper division level or to a graduate student.  It is particularly useful to students outside English departments who need the tools for textual analysis, for example, the seminarian needing to do literary criticism of the Bible, or the mythologist
