This book is more than just a hiking narrative, although it is that.  Listening to Bryson read his account of his Appalation Trail hike, you become immersed in his life.  You can almost see the forests, feel the breezes, enjoy the mountaintop views, and hear the wildlife.  You also become well acquainted with Bryson, his hiking partner Stephen, and many fellow hikers on the trail, and it is often very funny.  He also brings in a lot of the history, geology, and ecology of the regions he travels through.  I believe that the listener will find himself or herself very enriched by this well written work
