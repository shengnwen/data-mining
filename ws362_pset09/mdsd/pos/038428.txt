Dee Hock is not only a great story teller but also a "future teller".   The history of his incredible involvement with the rise of VISA only sets the stage for a fascinating look at the future as it "might become and ought to be".  Very much worth the read for anyone vested with leadership and/or innovation in any organization (which is everyone).

The one story not told is how the book was made to come about.  After reading of Dee Hocks life experience it seems that it is simply "how it ought to be"
