You do not have to live in the Bay Area to enjoy this book!  Do yourself a favor if you like Historical Fiction and pick up a book hard to put down.  It has everything: an earthquake, good, evil, fires, corruption, greed and romance. The story and the characters draw you in. I was disappointed it had to end and am really hoping for a sequel
