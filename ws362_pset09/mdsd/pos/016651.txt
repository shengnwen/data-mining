Cute animal pictures and captioning. Very long on it's description of exactly how one can feel crummy. However, it has a very positive turn around. I sent it to several NYS correctional institutions. I got instant thanks and requests to send to the inmates' family members. This little book appeals to a broad range of humanity. I've not met a person who hasn't smiled looking through it.
