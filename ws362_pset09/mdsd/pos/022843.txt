Going into law school, I did not realize how often I would be put into a situation where dressing was important.  In fact, dressing is not just important in the law, but it acts as a signaling mechanism to separate good lawyers from great lawyers.  Not that clothes determine legal ability; rather, there just seems to be a good correlation.

Knowing that I wanted to make stunning first impressions, but realizing how little I knew about dressing, I turned to Alan Flusser's book.

"Dressing the Man" is not only pictographically stunning but it is a fashion "constitution" of sorts -- a loose set of rules (and the corresponding ways to bend them) that can be easily utilized to dress better for every occasion.  

While Flusser's tastes tend to run higher end, he does not begin and end his world in bespoke (pricey custom made clothes)but instead teaches you how to discern quality.  For example, the suit should fit a certain way, be cut from certain cloth, or be made in a certain style, depending on your style and body type.  Ties need to have a certain "hand"; shoes need to be cared for properly.

What Flusser does is to gather together sound rules of style (not fashion), pair them with knowledge of fashions from different eras, and tie it all together with the (sadly) lost wisdom of a bygone era.  While he likely won't recreate the culture of smart sophistication that he and I both long for, he certainly can teach young (and old) men to dress sharply in a world of casual slovenliness
