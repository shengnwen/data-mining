Mobile, Alabama, detectives Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus go on alert for further indications of a serial killer-in-the-making. When Ryder is abducted, his partner and his journalist girlfriend discover a dangerous web of secrets. The question becomes: What will the perfect family do to protect an image of perfection?

Jack Kerley strikes again with a suspenseful thriller that provides plenty of deceit, murder, and greed. This novel is as good as his last and will provide the reader with a riveting story.

Highly recommended
