This is a very well written textbook. However, it would help if you have some background in Fourier series and DFS (Discrete Fourier Series). It is important that you understand that in a linear system you can use superposition. These are linear differential equations that are talked about in this book so the idea of superposition is used a great deal in the process of solving PDE's. This is not really explained forcefully enough in the text. If you have these as background the text should be a breeze. I really like the idea of 47 short lessons. He is right. You can do about one lesson a day. Therefore, you should be able to finish the entire book in about 47 days. I have found that most math textbooks are written in a puzzle format so that you must have a paper and pencil handy to figure out exactly what the author is saying. While this is still true of this textbook, in most lessons the author works through a specific example instead of giving general equations like many math texts do. In one lesson, the solution is found graphically. It took me a while to understand what he was trying to do. The first 300 pages of the book are on analytical solutions and then the rest of the book is on numerical solutions. He also has a chapter on the benefits of each method, analytical versus numerical. I think the numerical methods are more useful as they are more general, and will solve more types of PDE's. I really studied this book as background for a book on the finite element method and I believe I accomplished what I wanted
