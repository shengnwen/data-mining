I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say that it is one of my favorite books.  The imagry that Kidd uses is amazing.  I could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia.  You fall right in love with the charicters.  This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love.  It is such a dynamic story with suspense.  I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone
