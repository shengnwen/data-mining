I love Vicki's books, her sense of humour and sometimes outrageous comments help me feel sane in this otherwise insane parenting ride.  If you're looking for the politically correct, always attached parenting book...please save yourself the bother, you'll only get hot under the collar!  If, on the other hand, you struggle to do your best, have a load of parent baggage left over from your parents, feel life has got to be more amusing than it currently is...then read and enjoy
