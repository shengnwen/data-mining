This biography/autobiography was a fascinating look at the issues of race and identity as they played out in the life of one family.  I was a little disappointed, though, at the brief exploration of those issues in McBride's own life.  It seemed like he didn't spend enough time developing the topics--maybe it was just too much for one book
