It is very easy for any of us to  strole through life and struggle with situtations that seemingly  set us  back when we are trying to get ahead. &quot;Something to Smile About&quot;  offers a daily dose of inspiration that  reminds us many others have had to  overcome insurmountable obstacles and have survived.
