I read this book as part of an MBA programme, but it's far, far more than a business book.  In a series of self-examination exercises, Handy teaches how we can all reassess our lives and change the way we live and work.  All  this is achieved in a slim, matter-of-fact volume that puts many other  business and management books (as well as the slew of self-help literature)  to shame, with its erudition and the well-read eclecticism of its author.   Maybe half a dozen books in a lifetime make you change the way you think.   If this isn't one of them, there's no hope for you
