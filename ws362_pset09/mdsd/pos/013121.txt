Dennis Lehane's Mystic River is a suspenseful, mind-teasing thriller that keeps the reader geussing and wanting to read more.  One of three friends gets kidnapped and molested as a child, but manages to escape four days later.  Twenty-five years after that, the friends have grown apart, and one of the men's daughters has been mysteriously murdered.  This tragic event brings the three boys back together again and shows that the past can never be hidden or forgotten.  I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to be kept geussing with a suspenseful murder mystery
