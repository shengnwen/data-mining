This is an excellent tool for trainers, professors, fitness professionals or students who want to engage in active learning. As a health/fitness trainer and an Associate Professor at a University, I use the book and CD during training courses, academic seminars and as a quick - interactive reference available in all our human performance labs on campus. Internationally, my training seminars in Asia and Europe include the materials because they are understood in any language. Students can explore questions on their own, at their own pace. The challenging information is presented in way that there are multiple methods (text, color pictures, CD 'live' movement and narrated on screen lectures) so everyone can discover the answers to who, what, where, why, how the body moves. Dr. Golding left no muscle or joint unexamined in this incredibly comprehensive tool kit for learning. It's a masterpiece that progresses learning and allows students to discover the human body at their own pace using reliable information. Thanks Dr. Golding for once again, making our work as educators a pleasure!
