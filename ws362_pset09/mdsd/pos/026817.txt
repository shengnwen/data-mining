I've bought and read many, many books dealing with comics history, and this volume is one that proudly sits with the rest of the collection!  If you have even the slightest interest in the Golden Age of Comics, Jack Cole or Plastic Man, you definitely owe it to yourself to get this book (and Amazon's offering it cheaper than I got my copy!).  There are several complete Plas stories included in this book, making it worth the price by itself, but the retrospective of Jack Cole's career also makes for fascinating reading.  I couldn't put it down, read the thing in one sitting
