After reading some of the reviews available, I felt it was necessary to provide a more balanced perspective on this novel.  A few years ago, I read The Secret Life of Bees.  Admittedly, The Mermaid Chair does not quite measure up, however, it has its own merits.  

While readers may not necessarily agree with the portrayal of religious figures, I do not believe that Kidd in any way is attempting to show them in a negative light.  If one has this interpretation, it is a shallow one, at best.  Initially, I myself was disappointed by the main character's preoccupations with men, but it takes looking beyond these aspects to come away with perhaps a different interpretation.  

I feel that this work helps us to begin to discover what makes us all human, and that many issues, despite what the American public tends to think, are complex and don't necessarily have clear-cut answers.  Each of us is a human being with unique experiences.  Perhaps then so-called hard-and-fast solutions are not fitting for many situations.  Who among us should judge for another what is right and wrong without gaining some perspective on their personal situation first?  Furthermore, everyone is not immune to making mistakes.  Perfection is not in the realm of what is human, and perhaps imperfection serves an important function in forming who we are.  Given this, even seemingly insane behavior, like Jessie's mother cutting off her fingers, begins to make more sense.  

I urge readers to look for a meaning that goes further than crazy people cutting off fingers and a married woman having an affair with a monk in order to come away with a better understanding of what it is that binds all of us together
