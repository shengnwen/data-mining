Being an avid fan of Sue Grafton and having read all the other Alphabet mysteries, I was not disappointed.  Kinsey Millhone seem to grow more emotionally in this book.  The storyline was intriguing and at the same time very bizarre.  You can't believe human nature could be so wrong.  I recommend this book and author highly
