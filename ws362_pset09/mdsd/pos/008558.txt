I must admit I was dubious, but of course, Bujold delivers again.  This is a great book, which I read in one sitting on a plane, and then had to immediately re-read.  My only quibbles are that there should be some redeeming explanation from Fawn's parents about their lamentable lack of awareness of the soul-destroying effects of older brothers, and maybe a bit more background about the Lakewalkers, as per Barbara Hambly and Icefalcon's Quest, but hey, the second volume may cover all that.  Can't wait
