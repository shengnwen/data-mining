This is Bellow's third novel. 'Dangling Man' and ' The Victim' were two compact novels written as Bellow himself said ' correctly'. In this work he finds his own voice, an exuberant Americanese open to the open road of all experience, and happy to create itself in being transformed by whatever it meets. It has its roots in Chicago, and in the Yiddish language and in Russian and American literature, but it takes off in its own particular colloquial way. Until Bellow no one put the mind to the service of reconstructing everyday life in the same way. James of course put the mind to use in transforming experience but his world was a refined one and his people consciousnesses of subtle complexity. Augie March and Saul Bellow meet the world, and the street and a thousand characters on their picaresque road, and like Twain's Huckleberry Finn they seem to talk the languages of everyone they meet. 
As to the overall structure of the book, and its goingonness , I can say that for me this work is a preliminary to better Bellow books , above all , Herzog. But this is the real introductory shot, the announcement that a new voice is being heard in America literature. 
And what hope and youth in that voice. God bless you, Saul Bellow for having had it. (This review is written a day after Saul Bellow has gone with the help of God, to a better world)
