A fascinating read using Vedas, archeology, varied sources to make case against Aryan Invasion theory (conclusive), for very ancient continuous tradition predating Sumner (believable), and for connections between early Indus and later Ganges cultures (also believable). 

Until the Indus script is broken and more archeological work done in the Thar we anxiously await further proofs and revisions. Very recent under water cities that likely are about 7000 years old will add to the story when explored. Exposes racial, cultural, disciplinary biases that have held back 'progress' in better understanding early civilization and its continuity in India.

This is far more than idle or imaginative speculation and well worth reading although traditional historians would appreciate more sources of evidence and may be uncomfortable with that which uses early Vedic texts.
