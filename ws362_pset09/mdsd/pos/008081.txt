Outstanding Third book in the series.  

Some Magic certainly does still exist in the Ohmsford Bloodline in this latest generation - which IS THE POINT of the repeated visits by one of the greatest fictional Wizards ever created.  Allanon's role in this 'future' earth is clarified in "The WishSong of Shannara."  And Brin, the couragous and rightfully confused heroine, is not too unlike teens today, caught up in their own little universe and totally unaware of their own "wishsongs."

I wonder if several hundred years from now there might not be a real "Cogline" with some left over "magic" from the 21st Century.  And I wonder what kinds of names will really be used to describe the different "races" at that time (..."trolls" ??? ... maybe, most likely to demonize the enemy during warfare... just like today... and yesterday.. and the day before that... lol).
