I loved reading "A Womans Place" by Lynn Austin.  This is the first book that I read by Lynn Austin and I could not put it down.  I loved the backdrop of the American homefront during WWII and how women proudly worked to help win the war.  She  tells a great story of how 4 women from different backgrounds became good friends in the workplace.  I hated to put the book down!
