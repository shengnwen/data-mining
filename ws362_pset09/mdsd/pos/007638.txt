This book flows great. I've read all of Anne's books and, just as I am with her others, I'm very impressed with this one. It flows great. I really feel like, as the author, Anne is sitting across the table from me talking me through each step. It's practical, real-world (just like all her work)and completely relevant for any manager who is committed to making &quot;high morale a high priority&quot;
