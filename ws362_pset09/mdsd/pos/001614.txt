I read this book when I was in 4th grade in 1993 and 14 years later, I was searching for this book for my classroom because I remember how much I loved it.  This book pre-dates Harry Potter by several years, and I've been trying to find this particular book because it enchanted me when I read it in my teacher's library.  I would definitely suggest this book because it has everything the HP series has (if you like that), but is unique and well written.  Certainly worth a try.
