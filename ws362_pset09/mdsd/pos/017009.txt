Well, i admit this book is really cool and is well written. It's a collection of memories and histories by Mr Andy Hertzfeld. While reading this book , i felt i would like to be at that time, on that place. 
It's a excelent picture if what was really happening at Apple , at  those times. Also it helps me to make a better idea about who is who on Apple team. 
If you like Mac history, you should read this book.
