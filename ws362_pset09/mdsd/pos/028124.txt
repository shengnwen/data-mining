Well, I just enjoy listening to (reading) what this guy talks (writes) about in his travels.  An example (just one of many, many) is about the Mafia Monks.  Seriously!  Their nefarious activities "never prevented their hearing confessions, saying masses, or preaching at funerals - in one case, the monk in question saying a funeral high mass and preaching piously over the body of a man he had ordered killed."  And I like the way he talks to ordinary people on the street and gets their point of view.  Yes, it's a topsy-turvy world, but it sure beats the artificial world of fiction.  I just visited Las Vegas.  People wasting their lives chasing the jackpot, the fantasy world.  Well, to each his own.  But Paul Theroux tells it like it is - nutty, maybe, but that's the reality
