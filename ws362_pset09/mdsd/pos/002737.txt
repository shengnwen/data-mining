This book, which I discovered in a catalog from World Almanac, I believe, was a very useful asset in my two years of learning experience as an emerging librarian.  I found information which was verified in my graduate school coursework to gain my Masters' Degree in Library Science.  Later, I found many recommendations and commendations for this volume.  I will continue to return to this book for resources and ideas and good basic aids to the librarian in an elementary school.  Additionally, their are great ideas that can translate to middle school and high school librarians and their many, multi-tasking roles
