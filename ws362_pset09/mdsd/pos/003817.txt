Thus far, I've been spared the torments experienced by many of the people  Mariah profiles in her book.  Her book touched me deeply on a far less  dramatic level:  Daily life.  Life at work, at home, and on the road can so  easily be an assault of small irritations.  Because of Mariah's gentle,  insightful book, I now pause to think empathetically about the  &quot;perpetrator&quot;.  Each day is now far more relaxed.  Thanks,  Mariah
