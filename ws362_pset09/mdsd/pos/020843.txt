WOW! After seeing Stedman speak in person, I picked up his book and read it almost immediately.  I was hooked from the first page.  His book captures your attention immediately.  Stedman has a wonderful way of  keeping you reading by telling stories while motivating you to action.  I  have recommended this book to many of my friends and family.  I have read  lots of motivational and personal development books, but found this to be  the most helpful and inspirational
