These two books are so well written, I would find myself thinking, "I want to read some more, too bad it is dark and there is no power", and related things.  I cannot get enough of this author and these books.  A must read for anyone who loves mysteries, real-like scenarios (the what ifs), and Christian Fiction in general.  I have not finished Night Light and already cannot wait for the next one!!!
