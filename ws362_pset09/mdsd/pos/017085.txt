What inspires an artist? a composer?  Why does music "speak" to so many different people?  This little publication is a painless introduction to fine art and symphonic music.  This is I Spy with a twist.  You are asked to gaze at beautiful and interesting artwork while playing different orchestral tracks on the enclosed CD.  "Can you hear the marching knights?"  "Can you hear the mountain stream?"  "Can you hear the rattling skeletons dancing?"  The book and CD open with a lovely "meet the instruments" section, which, in itself, is worth the price.  I think this book is best enjoyed with a parent and a non-personal CD player but a ten year-old with head phones could zip through all thirteen pieces independently.  You might challenge that child to create her own artwork to a piece of her choosing.  Or you could plunk a three year-old on your lap and look at just one or two masterpieces at a time.  My eight year-old uber athlete loves it and now insists on doing his drawing to music.  This book can be enjoyed in many ways, on many levels.  It will add spice to a gallery or symphony outing (or even a sibling's band concert!) and with such a wealth of material out there, I sincerely hope a sequel is in the works.
