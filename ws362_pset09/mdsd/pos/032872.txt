If I could give this book 10 stars I would! Brian Frouds'"Faeries" is the most amazing book I have ever read. I found this book when I was young and fell in love with faeries instantly. The illustrations are astonishing for a lack of better word. Alan Lee and Brian Froud not only draw the most realistic and imaginitive faeries, but the stories included in the pagess really makes you believe that faeries are real. Brian Froud is the original faerie author and has influenced an whole new genre with his artwork
