I'm a 22-yr-old liberal East Coaster and just starting to become interested in spirituality.  I'm very secular and "Jesus died on the cross for your sins / fire and brimstone"-type stuff is what time-after-time turned me away in the past. I honestly don't know half of the saints or religious persons referenced in this book, other than Jesus...But I've been interested in learning about the spiritual community and what spirituality can do for each other and ourselves.  

So my boyfriend lent me this book, which was given to him by a Jesuit priest, and it has been excellent for my baby-steps endeavor.  

The process is thoroughly explained and there's even a 'trouble-shooting' section at the end that tells the reader what to do if upsetting or difficult problems arise during your examen reflections.  I've been doing the examen process for a week now, each night, and it is a calming and educative way to end my day by listening to myself.

I would really recommend buying this book to give as gifts for people like myself who are curious...
