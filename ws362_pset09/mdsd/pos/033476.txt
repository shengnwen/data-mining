Ken Blanchard, John Carlos, and I wrote this book as a follow up to our best selling Empowerment Takes More Than A Minute.  This book is designed to help any manager or team leader or company president who wants to release the power of people for astonishing results.  We know that  empowerment is often viewed as a buzzword, but we also know that it works  for those who stick with it.  We think this book can help team leaders and  team members know what to do to keep moving forward.  Let us know what you  think and ask us any questions you have -- we will respond
