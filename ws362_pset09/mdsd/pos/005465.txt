Coming out to my mom and dad was the most terrifying prospect I ever had to deal with, but I knew the day would come eventually when I had to face them with my being gay.  Like so many gay people, I had no idea how to do it or even how to know that I was ready.  Thank God for this book!  It helped to make a potentially horrible experience better for me and for them.  Thank you, Ms. Borhek
