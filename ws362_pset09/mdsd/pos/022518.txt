Bought this while living in Phoenix.  It's quick, easy, and has explanations even a gringo can understand and fix.  I have had this recipe book for 15 years and am looking for copies for gifts.  Just tonight I used it to find a quickie recipe for taco seasoning because I didn't have a store bought packet of seasoning.  The family didn't know the difference.  Salsa, Fideo, sauces. desserts-all quick and all easy!  Wish she'd write another one!
