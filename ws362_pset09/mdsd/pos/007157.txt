Having seen the film that this book is based on several times, I was curious to read into the whole story... and this book does not pack any punches.
Whilst I did not expect a 'G' rated book, I certianly did not expect some of the in depth writing that is included.  However it is all relevant to the story.
Definately a book for our times
