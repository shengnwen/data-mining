      I think that this book is a very in sightful book becuase while i was reading it. It made me think about what i could do to change some little things in my life that i wasnt satisfied with. Like my behavior towards my parents and family members.It also made me think about how i was treating myself and others with such disrespect. Another thing i taught me was to lave me for who i am and not for who everyone else wants me to be.
       See i think that it made me think these ways becuase i took the time to read deeply into the book and try to look into the deeper meaning of what they were reallly trying to tell us (girls the ages of 12 or older). i also think that i feel this way becuase iam a chatholic and belive that what god gave you was given to you for a purpose nto becuase he wants to punich you but becuase he wants to make you unique. another thing is that this book takes you to the next level with cofidence and the next level with god.
