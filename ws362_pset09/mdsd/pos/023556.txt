This is an amazing story of a young boy who discovers his mystic abilities at an early age, attributed to the development of his soul during previous lives. He later goes on to have amazing adventures, many of which test the limits of reality as we believe it and others that are outright disturbing and incredible. While I understand that there are masters who have a mastery over the workings of the universe, and they are one with God or the Godhead, I question any yogi who relies on passing on his message with use of these stunts. 

Parmhansa Yogananda is a proponent of Kriya Yoga, that seems to rely heavily on manipulations of the universe, although the basic premise is that it accelerates our arrival to a state of oneness with the Godhead. I struggle with any method that touts quick results to God (for that matter, anything), with the power to throw out a few miracles now and then, thrown in. While innumerable holy men have used miracles to help the masses, any serious form of Yoga frowns upon its indiscriminate use.

The path to self-realization is an intensely personal one, and in accordance with the hindu perennial philosophy, whatever method we choose to follow to acheiving this state, is the right one for us. In tune with that, certainly Kriya Yoga has a place in the world. However, I hope that the exciting powers that one may obtain with the practice of this yoga is not your motivating factor (wouldn't we all love a few powers like that?!) but a true desire to self-realization, otherwise it leads to unnecessary pain and suffering.

I recommend 'How to Know God - The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali', as follow up to this book. Go ahead, read both. It will help balance your view on some of the principles expounded in these books that are extremely powerful. As a lesser mortal, I remain in awe at what I might find within on this fascinating journey
