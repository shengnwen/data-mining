When I first picked up this book, it looked like a young children's book with a great concept for self control.  But as I read it, the vocabulary didn't fit with the type of children the book was written for.  The author tried to rhyme, but the words didn't work with each other.  Also, the book was very repetitive.  I don't suggest you read this to young kids because the message of "controlling freedom" was not portrayed the way kids understand.  All in all, this book is meant for older children and adults who just enjoy picture books.
