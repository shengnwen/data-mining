This book is remarkably superior to most books about the basics of photography.  The book begins with the vision of the photographer.  The entire first section is devoted to presenting outstanding images by great photographers and explaining why they are great.  The book does not begin as most do with the question of what camera to buy.  It places its emphasis on creating great images, which IMHO is exactly right.  The camera does not create the pictures.  The vision of the photographer does.  The book then goes on to explain the technical aspects of the craft (cameras, lenses, film etc.) in simple, clear and well written prose with good photos.  I highly recommend this book
