I found no cause for criticism. The text was informative and accessible, offering a tantilizing glimps into the life of a brilliant artist who was the darling of the Victorian and Edwardian era's but whom has been  subjected to much derision by succeding generations. Not having had the  good fortune to have seen the recent exhibition, I found this book to be  the next best thing. I would highly recommend it to anyone studying John  Singer Sargent, and for the general reader alike
