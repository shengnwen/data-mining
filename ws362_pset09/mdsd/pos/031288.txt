Crichton does seem to have a thing about protagonists who are single fathers, or who might as well be. With the exception of the main character in AIRFRAME, has he ever written a competent and caring young mother? Peter Smith, the protag of RISING SUN, is a divorced father whose ex-wife literally can't be trusted to change their two-year-old's diaper and do it right. He's also a police lieutenant who has switched from being a detective to the press division - and from there, to being the department's VIP liaison specializing in Japanese VIPs. It's his job to respond whenever a Japanese diplomat or executive gets in trouble with the local law, so that the incident will do as little public relations damage as possible. So one evening as he's studying Japanese (a requirement of his relatively new position), he's called in to smooth matters between an obnoxious detective and the owners of a new office building. Right at the start of their star-studded opening party, those owners have to deal with a murder in their boardroom.

Competent writing (I'd expect nothing less from Crichton), a decent although not wonderfully inventive plot, and fairly interesting characters don't save this novel from bogging down whenever the author decides to give his readers a lesson in history, politics, and economics as those disciplines relate to U.S./Japanese relations - especially to the well-known "buying up" of U.S. real estate and businesses by Japanese investors. I got the feeling that this book was written to sound a warning, not to tell an entertaining story. Yet it does have its moments of crackling suspense, and the relationship between old Japan expert Captain Connor and the much younger Lieutenant Smith comes across both believably and amusingly. Not a total miss, but not Crichton at his best, either.
