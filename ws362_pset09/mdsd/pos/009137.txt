I read Be Your Own Brand after hearing Karl Speak at a conference recently.  I was as impressed with the book as the seminar. The book is so practical and instructional to be a better person in all of our relationships. It comes down to living your values and making them the driver for your actions which makes your personal brand relevant, distinctive and consistent for others.  I learned that that's the key for being successful in my personal and professional life
