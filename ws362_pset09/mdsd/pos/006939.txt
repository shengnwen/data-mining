This is a story about 3 women, Willa, Lily and Tess who inherit a Montana Ranch from their deceased father who never laid claim to any of the 3 women. Willa was the only one left on the ranch and assumed she'd inherit until the will was read. In the will Jack Mercy, their father, stated that the only way any of them would get a piece of his pie was if they all lived on the ranch for a year together. They had never met before this day.

This is a story of family, love, trust, and murder. Ms Roberts has a way of wrapping your mind around one idea only to have you so convinced and then bam, the story changes. This story has quickly become one of my favorite Nora Roberts independent romantic suspense novels. She is a favorite in general, but his one had me anticipating what would happen next.
