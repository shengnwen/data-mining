This book is bascially a mid-upper division college text on the development of Modern Laos from the 1800's to the present.  A fine book on the recent history of Laos, the author strives to be fair and evenhanded in  placing responsibility for the various troubles plaguing the country.   However, I would have liked more general background on the country,  especially the history that predated European contact.  Only the history  necessary to explain some modern interactions is present from that period.    More maps and figures would have been nice as well. Only four maps and no  figures are present, and the author refers to many locations that aren't  listed explictly on the maps.  The type is set rather close as well, making  for a bit of a strain in reading.  That said, the information was well laid  out and seemed very well researched.  I learned a great deal about the  development of modern Laos
