This is a very intricate novel of the struggles of a once-serf boy wokingin the heat hauling water, who is then picked up by the famous ridder Ari, and his dragon, Kacheet. A wild dragonride later, and he is in the Tian, or enemy, jouster compound to serve Ari as a dragonboy to the first tame dragon ever. The story has many thrilling moments, and i must say that i was averse to putting it donwn once finished, but it also has a sensible balance of Vetch's everyday life that when read in detail can give a deep insight to his world. this was the frist book by Mercedes Lackey that I had read, but I have been convinced since then by other books that she is a great author and will be looking for more of her novels
