Some of the techniques I learned from "Respect for Acting" by Uta Hagen were causing me serious problems in my acting.  I was trying to balance too many notions in my head at once, and it was compounding anxiety and tension, and hampering my awareness on stage.

This book gave me a lot of useful replacements for those cumbersome method techniques.  Imagination is ultra-important and this book teaches you how to develop it.  Chekhov will teach you how to find true honesty from your imagination, and how to connect your physical body with your imaginative powers.

This is a brilliant man, who devoted his life to finding and sharing a hopeful approach to acting.  Stanislavsky openly regarded his great talent, and told him he had a great responsibility to try to share what he knew with future generations.  He took that to heart and now we have this book.

I only give it 4 stars, because I believe that a quest for an acting technique is personal, and this can't be the solution for everyone, nor was it the complete boxed-up solution for me.  If you have had problems with "The Method" give this a shot, though.

Check out his other book, "On the Technique of Acting."  It provides some useful complimentary information
