This book is much faster than regular therapy, and I am the type of person who likes fast results and I will work hard to get them.  I, like thousands of others, suffer with some anxieties.  This program is loaded with wonderful tips and tools in combating anxiety, and I have learned extra tools that I will incorporate into my own lifelong recovery system.  I liked the eight-step program that was used and I liked the "family" kind of feel it gave me when reading it.  In the future, I will be recommending this book to people who think they may have a problem with anxiety or if they are just inquiring about it
