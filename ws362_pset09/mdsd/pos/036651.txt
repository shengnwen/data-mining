Of all the wonderful books written and illustrated by the great David Macaulay, this is my favorite. It was also the first of his books to which I was introduced. I was about seven and I read and re-read this book while pressing my face close to take in every feature of its lovely illustrations. I hope children in all times are as lucky as I was to meet a special book like this one and have it carry them off to a magical world between its covers. 

All that said, let me tell you something about Castle. Castle, like most of Macaulay's books, tells the story of all features in the building of a great work, in this case it is Aberwyvern, a forbidding castle King Edward I is constructing on the Welsh frontier. Macaulay leads us through the selection of the location for the fortress, the clearing of the earth, the setting of the foundation, and the building of its mighty walls and skyscraping towers. He introduces us to the masons and laborers, soldiers and nobles who will live and work at Aberwyvern. And just when the castle is done, Macaulay shows us a Medieval seige in all its brutal depth, as the native Welsh fiercely battle the invading English and seek to bring down their imposing castle.

This book is truly one for the ages, and I cannot imagine anyone, small child through adult, would not love what they see here! I still have the copy I got when I was little and I get it down from the shelf to read at least a few times a year.

I hope this review was helpful and I hope it leads at least one person who might not have known about Castle to the library or bookseller to discover this special book
