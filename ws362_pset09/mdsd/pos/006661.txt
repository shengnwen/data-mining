Kathy Reichs writes relatively intelligent books, given her field of training is as a forensic anthropologist. I was a bit chagrined to see they attempted this year to turn this series into a television series. In doing so, they deleted some of the most interesting parts of her books, the relationships between her work down here in the states and her work in Canada. 

In this book the decisions that people make, including Tempe's own nephew, impacts greatly the lives of other people. A child gets in the way of a war between bikers and is shot; Tempe gets involved perhaps where she shouldn't be involved and that has an impact on her beloved mentor in Canada; information spread about her boyfriend impacts Tempe, only for her to find out it is not true. This concept of free will impacting the free will of others is one that needs to be more frequently talked about with adolescents, as they too often live in the moment...thinking that just 'one time' is not going to have a life-long impact...but that isn't true. I've seen it happen too often in my family and in the friends of my family and their children to know that just one drink when you are pregnant can severely impact your baby (spina bifada); just one try on a specific drug for someone with an addictive personality can lead to a lifetime of addiction. It always has an impact.

Reich's writing is good as usual. I hate to see this series ruined by television...not sure I will watch the show when I enjoy the books.
