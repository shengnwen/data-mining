I am always on the lookout for any reminder of the beauty and wonder of living. In Life Prayers, I found a generous serving. Here is a book to carry you through the ordinary days of living and  the not so ordinary  times in life when we are caught off guard and lose our way. This eclectic  mix of prayers, blessings and affirmations, will help you find your way  back to a heart of gratitude. Its very earthy quality, carries on the  tradition of reverence for all life which was started in the first book:  &quot;Earth Prayers&quot;.  Here is a warm gift to give others who are just  beginning their spiritual journey, as well as for those of us who have been  walking the path for awhile now.   If you enjoyed such books as Jon  Kabat-Zinn's&quot;Wherever You Go There You Are&quot; or Andrew Harvey's  &quot;Light Upon Light&quot; then you will love Life Prayers.   Early on in  &quot;Life Prayers&quot; there is this reminder:  &quot;Empower me to be a  bold participant, rather than a timid saint in waiting, in the difficult  ordinariness of now;&quot;  This book is not aimed at anyone spiritual or  religious outlook. It is a reminder of the beauty to be found in our daily  living. Many of these are sweet pieces I have never seen before, and some  and like old friends.  &quot;May those whose lives are gripped in the palm  of suffering open even now to the Wonder of Life. May they let go of the  hurt and Meet the True Self beyond pain, the Uncarved Block that is our  joyous Unity with Holiness....&quot;  There are prayers and affirmations,  meditations and reminders, enough to read a new one every day of the year,  but I think you will find that you can't read just one a day. I encourage  you to give this gift to yourself
