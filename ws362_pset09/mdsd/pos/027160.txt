This is an exceptionally well written book about three important aspects of marriage: emotions, spirit and body (sexuality). Joe demonstrates how important it is for a husband and wife to practice and grow in their emotional, spiritual and sexual connections. He also provides clear and easy-to-practice exercises in communicating and connecting with each other.

A very important feature of the book is on overcoming hindrances in our relationship with our spouse.  Guilt, fear, shame, low self-esteem or any other negative attitude does not need to hinder or disrupt our "oneness" with our husband or wife.  Joe has a very good section on forgiveness.

This book is excellent for individual or class study and is also great for wedding gifts.  Give a young couple a gift they will continue to benefit from for many years.

One more thing - Joe provides ample scriptural witness to the points and discussion in makes in his book.  "Becoming One" is one of the best books on marriage I have read. If you liked "Love & Respect" and "His Needs Her Needs" (see my reviews) you will like this book as well
