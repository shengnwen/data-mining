The best volume in Cahill's "Hinges of History" series by sheer weight of content and it's historical importance. It is nothing short of a Greek Tragedy, however, that such a "cream-skimming" review be hailed as important or original when these things should be known by every western "grandchild" of Greece (and educated people everywhere).  History's most substantial subjects deserve more . . . substance.  So with this relativist reasoning, I definitely recommend this book  (but NOT the audio book of which Olympia Dukakis's "bull in a china shop" reading is the least euphonic experience I've had in years)
