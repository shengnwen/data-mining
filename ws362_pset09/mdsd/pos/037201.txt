Cape Light is the kind of place where you'd like to spend some time getting to know its inhabitants and enjoy the scenery. It's a town where people hold secrets and pain in their hearts as well as their secret longings. But it's also about people trying to get through the everyday struggles of living and working together. Of course there are those who rub you wrong, as the case is with Charlie, who is not only running against Emily for Mayor, but is doing so in an underhanded manner. And then there is her mother, Lilian, who is against Emily's sister Jessica, who plans to marry Ben. Lillian thinks that Ben isn't good enough for her daughter. They are characters you might judge at first glance, but come to realize the pain and guilt that compels them to act as they do. Much like real people react to mistakes they've made. This story holds secrets to the way we can respond in a possitive or negative way to our wrong choices and how they affect others. This is a good read
