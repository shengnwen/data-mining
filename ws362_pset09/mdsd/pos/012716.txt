Based on his brilliant UK TV series Jamie proves that children are affected by the food they eat, not just at school,
but also at home. 
With the busy lives we lead today, it's all too easy to rely on ready-made meals. 

'Jamie's Dinners' not only offers 120 quality recipes that use ingredients readily available in any supermarket, but also shows how to make a lifestyle choice that will have a beneficial effect on every member of the family. 
The politicians were convinced by Jamie's evidence and we think you will be too!'

Having a number of friends who are very worried Mums,  this book is a 'must-have', after the devastating news of the TV series.
Most were intrigued by his theory that children will eat the food if it is nicely presented and frankly, if there is nothing else for 'Tea'!
This is a well-written book, immensely enjoyable and packed full of tasty treats - 'Pasta Bianco and Roast Chicken' got the thumbs up from the majority of children who have tried it!

Overall, this book breaks the mould, with most 'celeb chefs' assuming that we are all 'practical' in the kitchen.
You don't feel this with Jamie - even the least confident cooks have found great new ideas and put them to the test. 
Best of all the children have got involved and eaten their own end product!
