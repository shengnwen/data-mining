Filled with readable theology and helpful illustrations and anecdotes Cries From the Cross is a great introduction to the doctrine of the atonement.  In this book Dr. Lutzer breaks down Jesus' last seven "cries" into chapters that explain the reason Jesus had to die.  It is a short book and very readable, but packed with a smorgasbord of food for thought.  I found it a very helpful devotional guide on Good Friday as I thought about the price My Lord paid for my salvation
