For anyone who has traveled to Italy (or who dreams of it), this cookbook brings the simple yet effective trattoria fare into the kitchen.  As Wells states in her preface, "Homey, unpretentious, honest, and homemade, that's the heart and soul of Italian trattoria cooking."  The recipes she includes embrace this philosophy, and while some recipes are slightly more complicated than others, most are straightforward and easy to prepare.  

She includes robust fare such as "White Bean Salad with Fresh Sage and Thyme", "Pan-fried Potatoes with Black Olives," and "Cubed Pork with Garlic, Spinach, and Spice Chick Peas" along with more exotic "Roasted Yellow Pepper Soup," "Saffron Butterflies", and "Individual Gorgonzola Souffls"  She provides recipes for dishes more familiar to Americans as well, such as handmade pizza, penne with vodka, and macaroons.  Her "Speedy Lasagna" is a boon to the harried weekday cook.  The skimpiest section covers fish courses, with only seven recipes.

None of the recipes I've tried have failed, although I like some better than others.  All recipes are preceded by a descriptive passage of Wells's emotional connection to the dish, and some include a quote from a famous person.  Small boxes with such subjects as "Eating Risotto" highlight local customs pertaining to the dish.  The only thing this cookbook lacks is extensive color plates; the few it includes are often jammed with several dishes.  At first I thought this was a mistake, but now I realize homey trattoria food does not love the camera.  Most of these dishes won't earn high marks for presentation, but they will for taste
