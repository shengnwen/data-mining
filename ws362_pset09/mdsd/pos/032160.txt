I have only been a vegetarian for about a year now.  My biggest problems with veg cookbooks is that they tend to be full of strange foods I have never heard of, or the recipes are too complicated.
That is not the case with this book. All of the recpies are "do-able," even if you aren't a gourmet cook.  And all the recipes I have tried are delicious (especially the pizza recipes).  Also, non-vegetarians would like many of these recipes as well.  
I think I could live out of this book for the rest of my life. ;) I actually checked it out of the library twice, and then decided to buy it because I love it so much!  Yummy & easy
