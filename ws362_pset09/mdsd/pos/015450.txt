There are plenty of good thrillers of there, but not that many truly great ones. Val McDermid's Tony Hill & Carol Jordan novels are in that "can't put down"-category.
The TV series, named after the second book in the series, is one of the best and certainly grittiest crime shows you'll ever see, and the books are, well, better. "The Mermaids Singing"

I can see why some people who prefer a lighter and more humorous type of crime novel would shy away from these very harsh and occationally frightening stories with their lenghty characterisations, but they are really missing out on something. 
Journalist Val McDermid is excepetionally adept at creating a totally believable environment for her equally believable characters, and, like Dr. Tony Hill, criminal prophiler, she knows what goes on inside the heads of good guys and bad guys alike. 
"The Mermaids Singing" is the first item in the series, and it has been followed by the equally magnificent (and equally horrifying) thrillers "The Wire In The Blood", "The Last Temptation", and "The Torment Of Others". All are very highly recommended
