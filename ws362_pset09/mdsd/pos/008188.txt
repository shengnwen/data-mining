I bought this book for my 3 year old, and she absolutely loves it. It's a great book, because it's easy to read, and doesn't have a lot of text for 3-4 year olds.  My daughter loves looking at the pop ups when we read it.  It's so different from all the regular pop-ups, because of how much detail is included in this book.  We loved this book so much, that we got it as a birthday gift for her friends who are turning 4.  They are all into cinderella and princess parties now
