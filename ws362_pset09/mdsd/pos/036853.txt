If Gilbert doesn't hook you with her first sentence, then you must be in a coma.  "By the time Eustace Conway was seven years old, he could throw a knife accurately enough to nail a chipmunk to a tree."  That was all it took to pull me into Conway's life, whom I'd never heard of before.  The bare facts of his life are a testament to the saying, "truth is stranger than fiction."  Here is a man who makes his clothes out of buckskin, sleeps in a tent for 17 years, and sets records for cross-country horse rides.  Gilbert tells us about his accomplishments, but also tells us about the man:  brilliant but unsuccessful with relationships, from his father to his many female friends.  Conway's desire to spread the word about a simpler life has actually cost him the simpler life he once led.  His endless phone calls and public speaking addresses now eat up the time he could be spending on the trail or in the field, but he feels the sacrifice is worth it if he can save us from ourselves. 

Gilbert's style is snappy and conversational.  Sometimes we see a little too much of Gilbert in the book, but overall her style works to convey Conway's story.  I was never 100% clear on whether or not she interned on Turtle Island or simply visited frequently.  The organization of the story is also a little muddled, but still effective.  

As soon as I finished The Last American Man, I wanted to know more and was surfing the web to find out more about Turtle Island, Eustace Conway, and Elizabeth Gilbert.  If you are a fan of adventure non-fiction (Jon Krakauer, for instance), give this book a try.
