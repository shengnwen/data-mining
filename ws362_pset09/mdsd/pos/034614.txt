Tackling a new subject can often be intimidating, unless you have someone to introduce you to the basics.  This book does just that.  It is short, which means you can gain a general overview of web-based instruction (WBI)  within an evening.  The book starts by discussing the nature of WBI in  general - very helpful is the comparison to classroom-based courses. It  then moves on to basic presentation issues such as web page design.  It  presents the possibilities without getting technical.  In the following  chapter it looks at the ways in which interaction can take place with  students, and finally moves on to the broader issues of internet course  management.  You will find &quot;Practical Tips&quot; boxes throughout that  provide valuable guidance.  Also very helpful are the web-based activities  and numerous websites the author refers to, and this allows you to  experience first-hand the topics discussed.  In short, if you are new to  WBI and want a foundation to start from, this book will serve that purpose.   I thought just one thing was missing - a discussion of the significance  and possible future impact of the internet on the way we educate and our  thinking around it
