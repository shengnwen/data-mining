Protagonist Donna Trenton sure is in hot water, or should hot weather be more appropriate.  As if being trapped in a dead Pinto with a sick child in the middle of summer while a mean dog surveys the vehicle isn't enough...  But when the mumbo jumbo beast happens to be inflicted with rage on top of that, you can safely say that, besides being toasted in many ways, this lady definitely should have stayed in bed that faithful morning.  But, alas, like in any Stephen King novel, one has to pay the price, and since woman adultery is the case here, poor Donna has a lot to chew on, to say the least.  Writing in a alcoholic stupor (as stated himself) clearly doesn't stop King from delivering an effective read.  Indeed, CUJO is gutso with lots of blood, excitement and canine hair.  Its first half may be in neutral mode with its character development and action setting, but when the gear is shifted, watch out.  Driven to despair has never been more fun in the hand of this Maine man.  Cloned perhaps in its "Jaws" bite, CUJO is nonetheless pure King when it comes to compelling plot.  Just like its Saint-Bernard creature, the author clearly knows how to deliver the goods with drooling edge of your seat moments and in-your face action prose.  Yes, the novel aims for the bubble gum crowd but what a flavorful load of fun this one is--enough to hail it worthy of a sleep-depraved moment award, for sure.  Enjoy.-----Martin Boucher
