Great book.  Not the first book we have used.  Hunting Dog was also wonderful.  The only part we did not agree with was the paper training.  We just used lots of praise and a firm loud no, accompanied by a run outside.  Worked wonders and you dont have to worry about paper laying on the floor becoming wet.  Highly recommend this author
