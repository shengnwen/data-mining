If you have a passion for learning about ancient Roman life, as I do, then this book is a must for you. It contains a wealth of encyclopedic detail about everything from Roman roads to religion, writing to wine pressing, eating and drinking to healing and thinking. Moderns can only reconstruct ancient Rome in the mind in fleeting glimpses nudged into being at random moments. This book, more than any other that I know of, succeeds in bringing many such satisfying moments to life
