I WONT SAY I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING MR. WEINER SAYS AND SOME OF HIS VIEWS ARE WAY TOO EXTREME FOR MY TASTES. BUT I THINK HE MAKES SOME SENSE ON CERTAIN ISSUES. ESPECIALLY ISLAMOFACISM AND THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS ACCURSED RELIGION. AS A KEEN STUDENT OF HISTORY AND PHILOSPHY I WOULD AGREE WITH MR WEINER'S VIEWS ON THE RELIGION; ITS EVILS,INTOLERENCE,HATRED AND INCITEMENT TO COMMIT HEINOUS CRIMES IN THE NAME OF ALLAH. IT IS BIGGEST THREAT IN THE LONG TERM FOR ALL CIVILZATION IF YOU HAVE READ YOUR WORLD HISTORY.  SAY WHAT YOU WILL  BUT HE IS AN INDEPENDENT THINKER AND NOT LIKE THE OTHER RIGHT WING STOOGES OF HANNITY,LIMBAUG AND THE REST OF THE CIRCUS WHO TRY TO SPIN THE INADEQUACIES OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.YOU HAVE TO ADMIT HE IS EDUCATED,WELL QUALIFIED(WITH ALL HIS DEGREES) AND SPEAKS HIS MIND. IT IS GOOD TO HEAR HIS POLITICALLY INCORRECT SPEECH AND JUST CHUCKLE AT SOME OBSERVATIONS. AMERICA,DESPITE HIS EXTREME AND RIGHTIST TENDENCIES YOU NEED A PERSON LIKE HIM TO BLAST THE BIPARTISIAN HYPOCRISY AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. I THINK SOME OF HIS TALK IS MORE FOR SHOCK AND ENTERTAINMENT VALUE THEN REAL OPINION. WELL,PERHAPS HE IS EXERCISING HIS OWN PERSONAL DEMONS THROUGH TALK RADIO. WELL, MENTAL ILLNESS SHOULD NOT STOP ANYONE FROM DOING TALK RADIO.ANYWAY, THE SHOW IS NEVER BORING.
