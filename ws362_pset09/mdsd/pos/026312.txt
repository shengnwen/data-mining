I found this book to be an excellent rebuttal of Calvinism. Their exegesis on Romans 9-11 is the best offered. However, while I found the book able in its ability to point out why Calvinism is more 'fiction' than 'biblical fact,' I found myself wanting the authors to declare what Arminianism is as a theological system rather than just describe why one should not be Calvinistic.

Two more relevant points:

1. Their chapter on interpretation could have been better. I found that the authors could have summed the ideas of that chapter up in a page.

2. The authors do a fantastic job at demonstrating why piety alone is not enough to explain the significant contradictions found in Calvinistic theology epecially when it comes to such ethical issues such as the "Problem of Evil" and the consequences of believing in a "Limited Atonement." One cannot at every turn describe this issues as 'mysteries,' and expect to be taken seriously. Good did not provide a Scripture full of mysteries that we cannot understand, but a guide for how to figure out some of the mysteries in our lives as well as in the world around us
