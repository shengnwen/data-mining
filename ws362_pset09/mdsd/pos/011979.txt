As many other reviewers have stated, this is a helpful book.  But I just wanted to note that it is very mom-focused.  The author acts as if the bond with the mother is the only bond, and the father just happens to be hanging around.  Since it was written in 1978, this could have something to do with it, but I would argue that, while the bond with the mother is very important, parents can do quite a lot to assure that the baby is bonding and close to both parents.  Just something to keep in mind.  (This isn't meant to be a review of the whole book, just a side note.
