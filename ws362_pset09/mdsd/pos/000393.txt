I LOVED HARVEY FROM THE MOMENT I SAW TORCH SONG ON SCREEN. I'VE BEEN A FAN OF HONESTY, SINCEREITY AND COURAGE AND DOWNRIGHT HUMANITY SINCE BEING EXPOSED TO HIS BRILLIANCE. I'M AN UNDYING FAN SINCE.

THIS STORY SHOULD BE AN EYE-OPENER TO THOSE WHO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE - HOWEVER SUBTLY - FOR WHATEVER REASON, SEXUALITY, RELIGION, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR EVEN IF ONE IS BLACK, POOR AND FROM NEW ORLEANS AND DON'T HAVE BUS FARE TO ESCAPE HURRICANE KATRINA. 

DENIAL KILLS.

I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH FOR THIS TO COME OUT ON DVD.  I AM BUYING MY COPY NOW!
