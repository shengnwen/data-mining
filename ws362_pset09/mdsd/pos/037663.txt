This book is truly a collector's item! I own all the 1st up to the 3rd edition prints and reprints of the Chronicles Trilogy. I have collected them since the first release. I have recently received this book as a birthday present yesterday. This one adds nicely to my collection along with the Annotated Legends. 

If you're like me, who already read the 1st releases (without the miscellaneous commentaries contained in the annotated release), I guarantee it will be like reading a new book. Especially now that you will know tidbits of most of the characters in the book, histories as to how, where, who and why and such. 

Basically, the book is the compilation of the Trilogy but with extras like the commentaries from the authors and other people involved. The common dilemma about getting the book was that if you ALREADY own the chronicles trilogy, this annotated book would have little use to you. But if you're a collector, this would be a "Starjewel" for you that you'd like to flaunt at your bookshelf. 

I give it a 4 star. 

GET IT IF: 
You're a dragonlance novel collector or simply a fan who'd like something of a special edition of the famed novel. 

This would instantly be a classic, better than getting the old collector's item edition of Chronicles. 

If you're a first time reader of the Dragonlance novel, then I'd recommend this to you, but I advise that you ignore the commentaries along the pages so as not to spoil the story for yourself.


DON'T GET IT IF: 
You don't want another copy of Chronicles Trilogy in your bookshelf.
