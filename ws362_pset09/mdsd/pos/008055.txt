Will Kymlicka (whose homepage seems to be http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/biog.html) is a professor at Queens University in Canada, and has been called the most distinguished political philosopher of his generation.

This book is used as a college-level undergraduate text, and there is no other book that sets out the major positions and lines of argument as efficiently and as comprehensively. It's intelligently written, erudite, up-to-date, and includes copious guides to further reading.

The revised second edition (2002) discusses utilitarianism, liberal equality, libertarianism, Marxism, communitarianism, citizenship theory, multiculturalism, and feminism. All positions get a balanced, sympathetic hearing, but the broad leaning of the book is towards liberal egalitarianism -- or, at any rate, Kymlicka has the least to say in critique of it. The broad approach follows a suggestion of Ronald Dworkin's: instead of treating each philosophy as based on a fundamentally different value (libertarianism on freedom, multiculturalism on identity, and so forth), Kymlicka explores the idea that they're ALL interpretations of equality, and therefore comparable.

You might of course think this approach is wrong-headed, but it at least contributes to readability and makes for convenient structure. And readability is no small achievement, given the complexity of the subject area and the depth of detail that Kymlicka is prepared to venture into. You're delivered a huge amount of information -- for instance, around eight varieties of communitarianism are dealt with -- and you never get the feeling that things are watered down.

It's indicative of the clarity of the style that you can easily follow involved and subtly different arguments. The writing is even at times (gasp) entertaining.

And I thought it a mark of the care and sensitivity of the philosophy that though objections and questions arose to me, I continually found these already anticipated and soon addressed
