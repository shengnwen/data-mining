This very helpful book is by author L. Friedman, whose book The Channel Advantage from 1998 or 1999 is still appreciated for its comprehensive look at channel programmes and management.  This new book is broader in theme and less focused on channels as it is on general strategy issues one must confront successfully to take a product or service to the market place.  As with The Channel Advantage, few business practitioners or students will be disappointed and many will appreciate the inclusion of important new ideas and concepts for managing channels and developing a comprehensive go to market programme.  I found it very worthwhile reading
