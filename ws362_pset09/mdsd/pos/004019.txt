I was particularly interested in the sections on the 'homeless'. I spent some five years working in this field. As with Dalrympole's Life at the Bottom, and Bartholomew's The Welfare State We're In, Magnet applies a for too long dismissed common sense viewpoint. For too long the chattering classes have gotten away with arguing that social issues such as homelessness are the result of poverty, class, gender and race discrimination -(yawn!). The reality, as Magnet concurs, is a breakdown in Christian values (there is no alternative to the ten commandments),the family, and morality. Sadly, the resultant social policies stemming from the muddleheaded, liberal mindset of the 1960s has left in their wake, 'sink estate' victims. They have been the unwitting fall out from the failed experimental social fantasies of the 1960s' academics. The authors of these policies can escape along with their Chardonnay drinking cronnies to the comfort of their rural havens, but not so the many lives that their alternate social ideas broke. The homeless sections in Magnet's book complement Daibhidh Macadhaimh's Unlocking Carol's Smile (Trafford Publishing. isbn 141205550-4) a gripping novel set in the world of social exclusion. It is written from the writer's experience working in this field and tells it like it is. The emotional and social conflict involving the two central characters challenges a particular taboo within care in the community services: they develop an unlikely relationship. The book could sit comfortably on a social science shelf, not least because of its contrary ideological approach to the subject of the causes of social exclusion.
