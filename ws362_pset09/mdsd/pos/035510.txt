This is a stimulating and broad ranging discussion of developing trends in business and organization, focusing on the rate and nature of change and the evolving nature of markets and technology world-wide, liberating people  from the constraints of traditional industrial organizational structure.  This book is, in our opinion, Peters' most thoughtful and insightful book.
