This book is very good for any female who wants to start getting their lower body looking toned and sexy. Most of the exercises are basic enough for the beginer to do properly.

As an Exercise Physiologist and Personal Trainer, I was pleased to see the simple and realistic advice on proper nutrition and the importance of cardiovascular exercise. As these are crucial elements to 'having a nice butt'.

Even some 'veteran fitness enthusiasts' will get something out of this book if they are looking to fine tune their rear end.

Definitely a good tool to have (and use) in your female fitness library
