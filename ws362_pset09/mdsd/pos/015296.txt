The book is very helpful for parts you don't have and need.  It's great to look up the part I need for my Challengers and find other cars that have the exact same thing. Some of the things I have needed I have found on up  to 15 different cars. I have used it faithfully since I've purchased it.   The only downfall is that it isn't 100% complete.  There was a few items I  needed that had no listing for the interchange when there should have been.  Regardless of that one problem the book is still well worth the money.  Now  they need a book to cover my 66 Charger
