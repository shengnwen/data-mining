Ernest Hemingway, beside being the premier American author of the twentieth century, also fished quite avidly. The assorted writings in &quot;Hemingway on Fishing&quot; range from articles written for magazines, to portions of books such as &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;Old Man and the Sea.&quot; One of the stories rivals the Old Man and the Sea when it comes to futility and heartbreak in fishing for marlin. Excellent book: if you enjoy Hemingway and the fish of the sea, get your hands on a copy
