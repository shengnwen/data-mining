The world lost a real gem of a writer when Stan Berenstain passed on November 29.  Together, Berenstain and his wife, Jan, and eventually their two sons, created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families.  

All kids (and most adults) have some trouble when it comes to making friends and maintaining friendships.  It's not always easy!  This book can help open up a good dialogue with your kids about what friendship means, how to be a good friend, what to do when you have problems with friends, and so on.  It tells the story in a gentle way that kids will find not only informative, but entertaining and even funny, as well.  Wonderful
