As a translator of different plays from english to spanish I can assure you if there's an outstanding english playwright nowadays, then that's Martin McDonagh... it's only a shame he recently announced he won't be writing any new plays soon and will turn his talent to filmmaking, which is just as great but the theatre will have a terrible absence in years to come
