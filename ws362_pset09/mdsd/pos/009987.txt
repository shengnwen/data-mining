This is not the memoir of Carole Radziwill. It is a memoir for each person who reads the moving story. 

You will find yourself comparing the scenes in this work with comparable things that have happened in your life and the lives of your family & friends. You perhaps will find yourself viewing those captured in the tabloids in a little different light.

But - most importantly - you will understand it is those "little" things that makes life worth living and leaves the memories that are timeless.
