Occasionally sentimental, even purple in its prose, this is still a must-read. Primarily an account of the author's experiences climbing in Yosemite in the 70's and 80's, it's one of the only books I know of that  covers this period.Useful little sidebars give practical climbing  information,and many of the stories are just plain  fall-out-of-your-Portaledge funny
