     Having read all of Shaara's historic novels, this one is the best. The others' primary characters were all well-known officers. Sometimes I'd like to get the perspective of war from the common "grunt" soldier who was really in the trenches. Shaara provides that this time. 
     The first part of the book deals with the air war, since we didn't really get into the war until the third year, and I thought it was slow moving, yet interesting. The rest of the book deals with the land war and direct American action. I've never read a descriptive book of the Great War, and this book taught me quite a bit about the grit, grime, blood, and horror of the war. The scenes it conjured in my mind will be with me for a long time
