Glen Urban's latest book, "Don't just relate-Advocate" anticipates the seismic shift in market dynamics already underfoot and the resulting tsunami of emerging customer power that is already crashing in on our lives, due in large part to the sea change enabled by Internet technologies.

Looking back years from now, pundits and historians will identify this pivot point in business history, when "caveat emptor" began its slow death and "power to the people" was not simply a political mantra but a business reality.

Value-based organizations and their visionary leaders ("we can all lead from where we stand") will be well served to explore whether customer advocacy and the trust imperative are central tenets of their strategy, tactics, and organizational DNA, and if the answer is a resounding "yes" then Dr. Urban has provided us with a compelling roadmap for the years ahead.

Glen's thought leadership with respect to trust-based marketing, advocacy, and advise-based technologies has been instrumental in fueling our passion for, as well as, creation and implementation of a member advocacy culture at Mission Federal Credit Union in San Diego.

Consumers today are far smarter than we think...
But don't take my word for it, read the book and arrive at your own conclusions.
