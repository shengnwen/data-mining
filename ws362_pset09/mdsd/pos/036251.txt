I wanted to read Close Range mostly for Brokeback Mountain. The many loose-ends and unanswered questions from the movie were troubling. I was disappointed that the story was only 30 pages long and even more sparsely sketched than the movie. The other stories were gripping, but about halfway through I was wishing the book would soon be over. The stories were unrelentingly grim. I never kept a tally, but I believe in most of the stories one of the main characters dies and then is largely unmourned by the other inhabitants, who are too miserable already with their own bleak lives. In one disturbing story a young man is grotesquely deformed by an auto accident and is later castrated by neighbors and dies of a ghastly case of gangrene. The language of the stories is so contrived and affected that it seems like the entire state and all it's inhabitants were an invention of Ms. Proulx, with little resemblance to the actual state. Back to the subject of Brokeback Mountain. I wished that I had read the story before seeing the movie. Instead of two handsome movie-star studs, the characters from the story were pretty ordinary. One had a somewhat sunken chest and developed a growth on his eyelid and the other was heavy around the hips and had buck-teeth. I think the images from the story would have been much different from the movie and given it a very different, but truer, twist. On the whole, Brokeback Mountain is a wonderful and sad story about lost opportunities that makes the whole book worthwhile
