I am a facility planning consultant and have looked at practically every book about aligning the built environment with business needs.  "Strategy and Place" will be the one book I will be recommending to my clients  because of its broad and deep coverage of the strategic and organizational  issues which impact facility decision making.  O'Mara clearly describes the  numerous ways in which facility resources enhance organizational vitality.   Its most significant contribution is a description how business  uncertainity impacts decision making. A must read for anyone who has a part  in formulating facility strategies
