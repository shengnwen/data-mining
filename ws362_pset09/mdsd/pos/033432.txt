The approach of this book is extremely simple, yet the product is absolutely fantastic.  The editors of Christian History magazine (an outstanding periodical that I would recommend to anyone) have compiled a list of 131 key leaders in the history of Christianity, starting with Ignatius of Antioch and ending with Billy Graham.  These key church figures are organized by category (Theologians, Poets, Missionaries, etc.), rather than by chronology, which can be helpful or annoying, depending on the readers' reason for reading it.  Each person is described in two to four pages, with an interesting mix of significant events and trivial factoids.

As with any list of this nature, one could quibble about their choice of 131 Christians.  It seems odd that William and Catherine Booth were given two separate slots when so many other worthy candidates were omitted.  Nonetheless, no one will ever agree upon such a selection process, and I'm sure that the editors themselves found it to be a most onerous task.

In any case, I used this book as a supplemental text as I studied church history for two seminary courses.  These snippets into the lives of my spiritual forefathers were not especially profound but did a fantastic job of summarizing and highlighting the key moments in their lives, while managing to maintain a more engaging storytelling approach than an encyclopedia or other general reference book.

I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading some fascinating snapshots into the lives of the key players in the story of Christianity.  It would serve pastors well in helping to provide context for sermons.  It would serve seminarians well as a quick reference to previous coursework that might need refreshing.  And it would serve any faithful Christian well who is interested in reading about those who have gone on before us, providing the spiritual landscape that we now inhabit
