One reviewer stated, "This book was recommended highly by Ted Gunderson, a former FBI agent who now speaks out agains the Globalists. Gunderson claimed this book is the best intro in the the plan for a one world government."  

Compared to other, more current, books I have read this book provides more information in fewer pages.  It also had footnotes and references to most (if not all) the source information and even a glossary.  

I agree that this book is the best intro to the Globalist conspiracy that I have read so far.  Even though there are many more current books, this one provided many answers to questions regarding the period from the time of Christ to to near the author's death in 1959.  Once you have read this book, the more current books like those by Col. Donn de Grand Pre (2 new ones coming out in Sept. 05) will be easier to absorb.

I only found a few points that I would question on accuracy; but considering the amount of information provided that would seem to be expected, and I continue to find the "anti-semetic" label inaccurate.  Carr is anti-Zionist and anti-Globalist, and he also makes the point that only a small number of Jews and Gentiles are part of the "New World Order" or Illuminati.

He is describing the most ruthless of international organized criminals who have murdered regardless of race, religion, or political party; so we all need to oppose it while we still can.  The CFR appointments, the Federal Reserve System, the United Nations, the corrupt lobbyists, the Rothschild Empire, the thriving illegal drug trade, the assassinations of Presidents, the no-bid government contracts, the funding of both sides of wars, and the use of "terrorism" to destroy soverign democratic counties is history not theory, but it is certainly conspiracy, and this is the tip of the iceburg.
