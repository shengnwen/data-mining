In the late 90's my weight ballooned to 205 pounds while I drank 1/2 a gallon of Coke a day.

The revelation that I was fat came when my students began calling me "Drew Carey" and my uncle called me butterball.

I started Atkins Thanksgiving 2000.  By April 2001 my weight had gone from 205 to 165.  

This diet, in conjunction with proper exercise, will probably enhance weightloss for many people, unlike any other apporach they have tried
