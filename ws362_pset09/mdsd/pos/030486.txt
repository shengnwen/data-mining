This is by far, the best Jock Sturges book to date.  He once again has joined up with the Aperture Foundation for another monograph experience.  But this book is a little bit different.  Rather than a forward, followed by roughly seventy photographs, like his older titles, we look into the making of these photos.  Which to me was an experience in itself.  
For the first part of this book, we get the start of what turns out to be a short autobiography of Sturges, that appears randomly through the book.  And then we get several polaroids and low megapixil camera images of many models we have grown to love.  As you look at these very unprofessional images, burn them into your head and remember what they look like, because you will be seeing very professional images much like them later in the book.
The Second half of the book is a normal collection of photos that we see in all of Sturges' books.  The beautiful duotone images of the naturist communities of France and California.  It is here that you will start to see images you think you've seen before, but don't know where.  Then you turn to the first part again, and realize that all the random polaroid snapshots have been turned into beautiful large format images.  This is what is amazing.  Sturges doesn't shoot large format like crazy.  He shoots poloroids like crazy, and collects them all summer.  Towards the end of the summer, she goes through them, and finds "accidental" poses and turns them into real art.  Amazing.
Part Three of the book is a lot of commentary from the models themselves, even the loved Misty-Dawn Johnson.  It is here that we get their view of Sturges and his works, and what they think of modeling with them and how it was growing up through the lens of his camera.
This book is incredible, and any fan of Sturges' works need to pick this up.  Not since Ansel Adams' "The Making of Photographs" have we gotten a look into a masters eye like this.  Again, only one word is needed.  Amazing
