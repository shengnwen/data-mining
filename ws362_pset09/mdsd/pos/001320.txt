I picked this book up on a whim,and  I really am glad that I did. The story has kept me intruiged and wanting more.  As an artist my self I really enjoyed the story of Isabelle, her paintings and the mystery that surrounds them.  It is well worth the time to read it, plus it is short.  I am now a Charles de Lint fan and will search out his other books
