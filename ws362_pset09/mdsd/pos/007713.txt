This book seems to get a lot of bad reviews, but I really didn't think it was that bad.  It wasn't the best, but it hardly deserves some of the reviews it has gotten.  Yes, it is a bit slower paced, but it still has a lot of character development (mainly Roger and Bree, and I still don't like Bree, but that's neither here nor there).  It depends on whether you're comparing them to the rest of the series or the rest of books in general.  I personally don't think anything will ever top Outlander, but I definately don't think she dropped the ball on this one either
