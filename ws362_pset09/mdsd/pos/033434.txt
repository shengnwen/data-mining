It is madness for anyone to attempt to plumb the life of this prolific playwright who oddly left no written record of his personal life or literary influences. For that effort alone, I give author Greenblatt three stars.

For the amount of scholarly work and devotion to his daunting subject, I give another star; Greenblatt's love for his subject never wavers despite the obvious frustrations of trying to understand someone so elusive. He maintains that breathless "voice" right to the last page (there are 390 of them). At times his writing can tilt toward dissertation-like brain freeze, but overall this is a thorough and lively analysis of Shakespeare's literary journey.

My final star is awarded because Greenblatt kept me engaged in a story in which familiarity was breeding contempt. By page 300 I just didn't like Shakespeare anymore who seemed to use his personal relationships only as a means to an end - to fire his imagination and plot devices. He ruthlessly leveraged personal experiences (like the death of his 11-year old son Hamnet), to produce an immortal body of literature. 

Most people today love Shakespeare's work but could really care less about the man who wrote them, which makes this book a hard sell. If Shakespeare had lived to see that disconnect, he probably would have appreciated the irony and written a comedy or tragedy about it. He valued words above all else and is remembered for them only and, despite Greenblatt's noble effort, always will.
