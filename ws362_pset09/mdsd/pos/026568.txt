I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I purchased this book, but I love Chris Tomlin's music so I thought it would be an interesting read.

Chris takes us on his journey into worship leading, and the struggles associated with his choice.  Chris also manages to pack this book full with scriptures that have helped shape his life and choices.  He also goes through the creation of some of his popular songs.

While I agreed with a lot of what he writes, I didn't agree on a couple of instances. The first was living the "unnoticed life".  Jesus certainly did not live an unnoticed life.  We are called to be servants and to be humble, but I do not believe we are called to be unnoticed.  I also found the book to not have very good flow from chapter to chapter.  He also includes a section on putting together a worship team which I felt was a mistake.  Either the book is targeted to the individual or the worship leader, but not both.  Not being a worship leader, I liked the rest of the book but I was left wondering why the in the he would include that section for people like me.

However the book includes some good insights and gives a good impression of what Chris Tomlin is like.  I recommend this book to those of you who know of his music.  And if you haven't heard his music, go check it out!  4 out of 5 stars.
