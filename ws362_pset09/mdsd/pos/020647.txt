I found this book very interesting, considering the cultural clout attained by "Frankenstein" the monster. It was surprisingly not scary. There was very little descriptive gore. Some parts of it were actually bland and a little boring. The climax was obvious to the reader. I'm not sure if Mrs. Shelley meant for the reader to see what was going to happen to Dr. Frankenstein, or if she thought we'd be taken in as he was. I wasn't.

The moral of the story has implications for the current push by some scientists to control the creation and termination of human life. I am glad that I had the chance to read this book. If it wasn't for the library book club doing a season on "Spooky Tales," I would have never picked it up on my own
