"Naked" is a bizzare, yet humorous, glimpse into the life and times of David Sedaris, made even more bizzare when the fact sinks in that it's a memoir. Through his essays, Sedaris treats us to an insider's look at his warped childhood, and subsequent warped adulthood, touching upon subjects such as his golf-obsessed father, the relationship between his old-world-stalwart grandmother and his end-of-her-rope mother, and hichhiking days accompanied by a parapalegic. The essays are superbly written, perfect for reading out loud, enthralling, and endowed with a usually-hitting, self-depracating humor. Some jokes are hit or miss, but it averages out to a definitely amusing read. For anyone with a strange family, or a skewed view of the world, there's something in "Naked" to relate to.
