Okay, I figured out who the killer was within the first 200 pages. (I would say the exact page, but I don't want to give the mystery away.) But no matter--the how and the why is actually more than fascinating enough to make up for knowing the who. Like the hero of the book, the answers to these are things that no sane person, even one used to dealing with crime and depravity, could possibly anticipate. What a twisted, sick and fascinating tale! Lucas Davenport (one of my favorite cop/sleuths) is a top notch investigator, but even he is overmatched until the very end by the sexual predator/serial killer who rapes, tortures and mutilates the bodies of both male and female victims. Usually, I am disappointed when the protagonist can't keep up with or get a handle on the bad guy, but here it plays out as totally authentic and plausible. This is the fifth book I've read in Sandford's Prey series, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every one
