The Black Pearl is an excellent comic book mini-series for the following reasons: it's original, has character depth and exceptional art work. But above all, Hamill himself astounds me; he's multi-talented and for him to be able to pull me into a movie screen as well as a comic book is nothing  short of genius. Good job, Mr. Hamill
