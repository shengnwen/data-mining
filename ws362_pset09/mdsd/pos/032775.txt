I really enjoyed this book.  I liked the two storylines of the couple from 100 years ago and their counterparts today.

I felt the tension built well I liked the fact that Declan told Lena (Angelina) that you have live with some problems (her mother) but it doesn't reduce your own value.   

The end I found a little weaker than the rest of the book, which is the only reason I am not giving five stars.

Definitely a book I will keep and read again
