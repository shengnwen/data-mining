I can't tell you how excited I am to have found this book.  As a mother of a 2 1/2 year old little girl, I am thrilled that I will have found a tool in which to seek out books that will help build her self esteem, self  confidence and self assurance.  It'll accompany me on our many trips to the  library.  The books listed within, are phenomenal.  And best of all, it'll  carry her from toddler to teenage!  It's a must have
