This was the first drenai, and indeed david gemmell book that i ever read, handed to me by a friend who read it first, which was also much of a chance happening. He was at an airport,needed something to read and picked it up. Then it passed on to me. Thinking about it, it's like fate transpired to bring me and that book together, and i'm bloody glad it did, because it was, and still is, one of my favourite drenai, if not gemmell novels. I love skilgannon, and the complexity with which his character is described is wholely refreshing, as gemmell weaves an unusual fantasy tale,as most are the classic good versus evil, although, reading this book you get the impression skilgannon is fighting on both sides, and indeed fighting himself to a great extent. I also loved how gemmell set up the story with flashbacks which first introduce us to boranius, so that the face off between the two toward the end of the novel becomes justified, and greatly exciting. All in all, this novel is a must, though i would suggest reading the drenai series in order, as they are all as good as this, and will acquaint you with the world that is the setting for all of gemmell fine drenai novels
