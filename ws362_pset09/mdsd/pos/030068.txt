I am a book collector and I enjoy my passion very much.  Many people would say I'm obsessed but it only takes a book like this one to remind myself that I'm in the minor leagues.

Part memoir and part peek into the world of book collecting, Baxter tells of his youth in the wilds of Australia where, like many of us, he delved into the world of comic book and science fiction collecting.  He matured along the way with an interest in Graham Greene before dumping that collection and moving onto other literary interests.

And he did not stay in the wilds of Australia forever.  He travelled and made his way up in the world of film and publishing.  Baxter has had the fortune as a film critic, writer and collector to meet a number of interesting people, from the writers he collected to eccentric bookmen like Martin Stone.  The book has a definite British flavor, though Baxter has made some forays into the United States.  Still, any book collector will see things he recognizes in Baxter's experiences and, in some cases, things we wished we could have experienced ourselves.

Let's face it, a person with a passion for book collecting will feel some jealousy when reading of some of Baxter's finds and encounters.  Unfortunately, most of us do not have the means and/or opportunity to do some of the things Baxter has done.  But this does not totally diminish the fun in seeing how he was able to come to have the experiences he had and it makes for a great read for anyone interested in books
