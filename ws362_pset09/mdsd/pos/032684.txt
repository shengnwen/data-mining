John McCain's book is verywell written.  I found the advanced vocabulary outstanding.  The way the book is put together is very hitorically orientated.  He starts with his Grandpa and the impacts he made on John's life, then about his own father and the sacrafices that helped shape his faith.  How he did in the navy and being shot down.  Finally he tells you about His struggles in 'nam and how his hardships there helped make him a better man.  A really good biography and tribute, John McCain for President.  GOD bless POW*MIA not forgotte
