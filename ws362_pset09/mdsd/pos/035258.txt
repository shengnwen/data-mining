Winning Scholarships for college was the most helpful book that I read this year in my conquer for seeking scholarships. It gave me an inside  guide on how to achieve my goals as to where I want to be. This book helped  me get 3 schools on my list. And now I will be attending NYU this fall.  Thanks Marrianne Ragins
