It was a pleasure to reread this wonderful book. It took me back to my youth. I lost it and never got around to replacing it, I am enthralled to have it again in my hands. I highly recomend any of his books and also the site that lets you talk and discuss all of the metaphors in this book. a great read and insight into someones life thoughts. Yours in lit. J.C.M
