If I could give this book 10 stars I would have.  If you're into the &quot;Q&quot; - this is a MUST have especially for Memorial Day and the 4th of July.  This book makes a great Father's Day gift.  Recipes are easy to  follow and the food tastes delicious.   Especially liked the pictures and  stories.  This is not just your average barbecue cook book!  Try it you'll  like it!!!
