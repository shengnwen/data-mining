While missing the colorful photos of many gardening books, this book is a valuable reference guide to use as a companion resource.  The list of plants, attributes, dimensions, bloom season, planting time etc... in each section is a quick cheat-sheet when selecting plants.  The authors also distinguish between the different conditions in North, Central and South Florida.  The only drawback is the reference to plants only by common name without the latin name.  Since a plant may be referred to by different common names, not knowing the latin name may leave you wondering, or unable to locate an interesting plant
