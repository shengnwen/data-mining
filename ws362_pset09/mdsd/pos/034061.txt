As a &quot;seasoned&quot; online dater, I can honestly say that following Bev Bacon's advice will make your online life much better and easier! I've read the other books, and rather than rehash the same old tired, cookie-cutter BS that fills other internet dating books and websites, this book provides a proven framework that you can use to be original, interesting and attractive. Practically every internet dater makes the same mistakes and ends up as just another (boring) face in the crowd. Read this book and learn how to avoid those mistakes, and learn how to stand out from the crowd and get noticed. I love good comedy and not only is the book's information dead-on accurate, her writing style will make you laugh 'til your face hurts. Here's your chance, get it and get dates
