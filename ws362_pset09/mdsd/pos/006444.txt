This is a wild book with plenty of laughs in each chapter. The writing is top-notch throughout and the author clearly has a unique and wacky sense of humor as this novel is absurdism at its highest level. From what I've read in the Bizarro genre, I don't think too many writers are quite as absurdist as Mr. Sands. I especially liked the insertion of a screen play near the middle of the book, and I enjoyed how only one drawing was included near the end. Five stars. I only wish there would have been a tad more plot and that some of the interesting images explored a bit more instead of merely mentioned in passing. Of course this review isn't nearly as good as the fake one by Prof. Arthur Papsmear on p. 125 of the novel!
