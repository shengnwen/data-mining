Yes, this is a Western, but not in the &quot;shoot 'em up&quot; style so favored by other writers.  Kelton takes the time to develop the hopes and fears of young Joey Shipman as he seeks the family he fears he has lost. Can he find it in the drunken cousin he has met only once? Or in the abused prostitute? He certainly will never find it with the stepmother who seems to live to hate him, or with her murderous second husband. With nary an Indian attack, cattle stampede, or shoot-out at high noon, &quot;Cloudy in the West&quot; is a Western in a style all its own, a style which sets it apart from--and above--the majority of others in the genre. Whether you are a devotee of Westerns or are exploring them for the first time, this is an excellent novel to add to your reading history
