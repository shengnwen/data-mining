I love this book. Lana did such a wonderful job on this book. I have read it so many times.    My first copy of it was when I was a freshman in high school. I found it a used book shop. I loved it. It made me like both  Natalie and Lana. They are two of my most favorite actresses of all time.     My dad used to have a huge crush on Natalie.    She was a wonderful  person. I wish she was stil alive
