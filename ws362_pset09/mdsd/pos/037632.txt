The book was great and the drama was even better.  I could just imagine myself there with Mrs. White beating on the door anxious for her son to return from the grave.  But was it just their vivid imagination or did they really hear someone knocking on the door?  It is up to the reader to figure that out.  If you haven't read the book and think these reviews will help you do a report I advise you to read it.  It's not half as bad as you may think.  READ IT!!!!
