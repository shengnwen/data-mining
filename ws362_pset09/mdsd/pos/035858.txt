...I thought "Double Indemnity" was one of the finest crime/thriller novels that I've ever read. Walter Huff is an insurance agent who is seduced by a woman named Nirdlinger. They decide to kill Nirdlinger's husband in order to collect his wealth. But then this leads to serious consequences. 

With memorable characters, terrific tension, and good pacing, "Double Indemnity" is highy recommended if you're in the mood for murder and money. And try not to judge this book by its publication date. Crime and punishment from the 1930's can be a very interesting thing
