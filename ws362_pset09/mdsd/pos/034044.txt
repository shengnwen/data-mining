As with any collection of material both new and previously released the reader's satisfaction with this book will vary depending on their experience with the writer.  For those not experienced with Niven this book in addition to N-Space will put you into the right frame of mind to explore the rest of Niven's Known Space.

In addition to Known Space, stories set in other Niven arenas such as the worlds of the Draco Tavern and The Magic Goes Away are included.  I find these are some of Niven's best pieces of writing and they continue in good stead here.  I did not realize until recently that Niven and Pournelle's The Burning City (and sequels) is set in the world of The Magic Goes Away.

I also enjoy Niven's anecdotes and tidbits about conventioning and collaborating with Pournelle and Barnes.  I'm not a big drinker so his Irish coffee recipe doesn't do anything for me, but my wife will enjoy having something new to try out when we entertain.

Outside the norm, Niven's Green Lantern bible is an interesting read for a fan of the comic and another good reason to pick this up.

Though I skipped over a fair amount of the material in Playgrounds, having read it already in other books, I still find this a worthwhile addition to my Niven collection
