During our eight days in London, this map was our constant guide.  Laminated in plastic, and fan folded, like an accordian, I carried it in my hip pocket.  I could whip it out and open it in two seconds.  My 51 year old eyes had no trouble reading the print.  All of the information you need for locating and navigating the Underground is also included on the map.  When finished with the map, you can snap it shut, and tuck it back in your pocket, again in about two seconds.  We developed true affection for this helpful map, and it is now among our keepsakes from the trip
