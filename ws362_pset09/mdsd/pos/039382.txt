As a former Marine myself and now father of a Marine, I was interested in seeing what the crucible was all about. When I went through boot camp in 1982 there was no crucible. I purchased this book and read it as my son was going through the crucible. I found it to be a very informative book and a great insight as to what the crucible is all about. It chronicles the transformation of our young men and women into United States Marines
