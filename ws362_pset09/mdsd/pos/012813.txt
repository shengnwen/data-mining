 Spanning from Nov 9 to the first day of spring, these short, direct poems all reflect a pre-dawn walk in Nebraska "beneath a billion indifferent stars".   A short statement of the weather (for example, "two degrees and clear" on December 30) is followed by a short poem influenced by what he saw on his walk.   ("Older this morning, the moon /  hid most of her face / behind a round gray mirror").  

The poems sometimes reflect different shades of darkness, from "a deer of gray vapor" to   "a rutted black field". The poems are set within his recovery from cancer "Lucky I am to go off to my cancer appointment having been given a bluebird")

I read each of the poems on the same date they were written, which provided a personal contrast.  As a postcard collector, I would love to receive one of these poems on a postcard.
