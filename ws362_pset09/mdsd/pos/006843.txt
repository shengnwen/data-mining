This is my first Kurt Vonnegut book and certainly will not be the last. Vonnegut's book the "Piano Player" is a social commentary disguised as a science fiction novel. His choice of mixing religion and man's need to be useful with the ever-progressing technological evolution is genius. Even if his ideas of technology are a little out of date, the way it affects people's way of living definitely is not. His writing is very light and almost comical at times he doesn't burden the reader with extremes he merely comments on them in short excerpts switching back and forth from different view points and finally having them all come together in the end, proving that each point to characters are making are universally the same. Man needs to be needed. I look forward to reading more of his work
