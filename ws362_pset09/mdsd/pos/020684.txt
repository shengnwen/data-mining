Night Shift is a collection of Stephen King's earliest stories that were first published in the 1970's in various magazines such as Penthouse and Cavalier's. A great assortment of fun ones such as "Grey Matter," and ones that curdle your blood, such as "Jerusalem's Lot." Night Shift contains two masterpieces, standards of horror writing: "Quitters, Inc." and "Graveyard Shift." 

What I like about Night Shift is that the stories are good examples of horror. They scare or even terrify, but most of all, they impress. King is an excellent writer, and an educated college English professor. However, his later work such as Pet Semetary became more vulgar, graphic, and left the reader feeling ill rather than amazed.  Even though the dumbing down of some of his work led to his immense popularity, the horror created for mass consumption is inferior in some ways.  So it is good that we have these superior collection for the intelligent horror reader.
