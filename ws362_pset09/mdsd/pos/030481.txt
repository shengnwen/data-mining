I know Alan Moore is adamant that "Lost Girls" is pornography, but I just don't see it. Yes, Gebbie's art lends a dream-like eroticism to the book, and Moore does his best to infuse the proceedings with sufficient perversity to offend the sensibilities of those who like to be offended. But that's about it... "Lost Girls" is far too literate and artful to be a true, one-handed read.

Fortunately, I don't care that doesn't live up (down?) to the author's ambitions... it's still an amazing, enjoyable piece of work
