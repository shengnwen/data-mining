If you catch this exhibit in London, you will be amazed at how many of the photos you will recognize not knowing who the photographer was.  No wonder Princess Diana allowed only one man to catch her as she truly was, simply a woman.  The fashion shots and ad campaigns are great.  His celebrity photos are ok, but Testino is fashion and that is where his best work lie.  In either b&w or color, these photos speak!
