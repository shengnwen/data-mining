Having raised three "spirited" sons I can heartily reccommend Answering the 8 Cries of the Spirited Child.  How I wish I'd had this book when I entered my child raising years!  Not only do the Arps give us tangible, specific tools to provide understanding, encouragement, boundaries, and a listening ear to our spirited children, but they give us hope for maintaining our sanity as parents.  This book is a must read for all parents
