I sailed through this final installment of the Circle Trilogy this weekend and was absolutely entralled!  The Valley of Silence did not disappoint my expectations and I was very pleased with the ending.  I found myself deeply engrossed, and at one point-  bawling my eyes out.  

Some readers have complained that Nora Robert's books are getting "weirder."  I agree this trilogy is darker and has more tension than in some of Ms. Robert's previous books; but I think it is a better read as a result.  This trilogy is, in my opinion some of her best work, on par with the "In the Garden" and the "Three Sister's Island" trilogies.  If you enjoyed these trilogies, you will likely find yourself happily immersed in the Circle Trilogy
