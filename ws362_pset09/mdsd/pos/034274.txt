I have found this book to be very helpful if you are REALLY interested in doing asynchronous work online.  The authors are leading edge thinkers about this subject who have earned themselves a place in the world consulting to people who want to do this.  The problem is that many, many people only THINK they know what asynchronous learning is and until you actually experience it you won't know.  Can't know something until you learn it.  Rena and Keith have done a very good job of showing you EVERYTHING you need to know to get the job done.  You can use it like a menu, take what you want and leave the rest alone.  They spend a good deal of time trying to get people to understand the TRUE nature of an asynchronous world.  They are sincerely at the leading edge.  I think I know what leading edge is, I think I'm there experiencing true asynchronous learning now at the renowned Fielding Institute.  Good book for your reference.  You may not need all of it NOW but you will soon
