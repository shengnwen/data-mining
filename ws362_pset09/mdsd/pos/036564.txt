We used this book when my child was one to help him learn how to talk; now that he is four we are using it again to help him learn how to read.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.  The illustrations are clever, inventive and amusing and it has a sly sense of humor throughout.  A true classic; may it never go out of print.
