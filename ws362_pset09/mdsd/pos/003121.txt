My significant other and I have haven?t taken the time to secure our financial future because of a hectic schedule, and frankly, have been intimidated by the process. When the 2000 Census was released, I found out that I was one of 11 million people living with an unmarried partner in the U.S. (including both same-sex and different-sex couples). While it?s nice to know I?m not alone, this book helped me understand how financial planning is especially important for unmarried couples. Unmarried couples do not have the same financial benefits afforded to those who choose to marry, such as health insurance and Social Security survivor benefits.

What I love about this book is that the authors explore a wide range of issues, including how to work through a co-parenting agreement and how to decide whether to share a bank account. It?s super easy to use (if we can use it, anyone can!), and includes specific exercises which walked us through those details that I dreaded using simple tools such as bulleted lists, and a glossary of all of that confusing financial jargon. 

What an inexpensive investment for something that has helped us gain a very clear vision on our financial dreams, motivations, and blocks, in order to prepare my partner and I to plan for financial success.
