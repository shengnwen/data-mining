 I think this book was pretty interesting on how she lived a lot of her life helping gorillas. She wrecked poachers traps and learned to live somewhat like a gorilla. I would be very interested to read about her murder and why it happpened. She was a very brave women and lived very simply, yet she loved it. I thought she did a great thing.
