One of the residents of Martha's Vinyard is quoted in this book as saying that it is a microcosm of the United States. It isn't, it's a microcosm of what the United States SHOULD BE. 

Vernon Jordan, is quoted as saying, 'there was a time when the Vineyard was the only spot for successful black people, and in many ways it still is.' And that's good. There should be places where the stresses of our daily lives are relaxed regardless of the color barrier. 

Perhaps it's the isolation, perhaps the income level, but I read this book while 26,000 National Guard troops are being sent to New Orleans. There the mostly black, unbelievably poor are reportedly shooting at the helicopters bringing releif supplies into the city. This is not going to contribute to the long term state of race relations. 

This book is good to read just to show what a delightful place the world could be
