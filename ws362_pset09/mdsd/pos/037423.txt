There aren't a lot of books that both a little child and a weary (wee bit bored, perhaps?) adult can both appreciate.  This is one.  Keats understands how young children think, how they look at the world.  When the young protagonist Peter sits in the tub and thinks and thinks about the day's adventures, I'm struck by recognition both as a parent and as a former small child.  I've seen that faraway expression, that serious working through.

The deftness of the language and the beautiful illustrations humble me.  The focus of the story and the things that fascinate young Peter also fascinate my little boy, who is 19 months old.  He asks me to read this to him at least three times a night.  And it's so wonderfully done, I don't even mind.

Whether your child is white, black, purple, green or checkered, get this book.  This is a wonderful book
