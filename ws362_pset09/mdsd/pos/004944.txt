I just finished reading "Don't Think of an Elephant" and I must admit I am impressed.  George Lakoff is a professor at the University of California and teaches cognitive scientist and linguistics.  These concepts are very tangible in the context of this book.  There are many terms used, such as "Wedge-In Issues" and "Hypo-Cognition" that really offer a lot of insight in the realm of political science, despite party association.

Lakoff is obviously on the left side of the fence, but isn't too much of a fanatic when speaking about his liberal/progressive beliefs.  However, there are some moments that he is implying notions such as "never" and "always" to describe the Republican Party.  When you are a cognitive scientist/linguist you have to be careful what word choices you select.   Why, because nothing in life is "always" or "never".

"Don't Think of an Elephant" is very much a book that could be used in a college class, just for the terminology and intellectual style, despite the fact the book is aimed more towards the Democratic Party.  Nevertheless, Lakoff is an extremely intelligent individual and I might not have agreed with everything in this book, but prone to read another one of his works.
