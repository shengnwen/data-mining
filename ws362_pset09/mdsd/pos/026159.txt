First of all, I must take offense to "A.Dick.Weed"'s comments...I am so angered at his words...I think his name and location says it all!  Where is his proof that the author is a "redneck white" or that those reading this book are "only other whites, and wanna-be Indians"?  Just because a person has a "redneck" or "white" name does not mean that person is not Native American! I guess A. Dick Weed considers himself an authority on Native American names and thinks that all Native Americans MUST have names like Sitting Bull or Geronimo to truly be Native American.  What about Chief Dan George - do you see ANYTHING Native American about his name?  No, only his title of Chief, but here is a TRUE Native American! Enough about being angry with A. Dick Weed...it is not only a waste of my energy, it brings down my spirit and saddens our Creator.  I purchased this book for my husband, who although does NOT have a Native American sounding name, IS Native American of Cherokee descent.  He absolutely loves this book and reads it almost daily.  He has also shared many of the daily 'walks' with our Native American 'brothers and sisters' - many of whom  don't all have Native American sounding names. This book is terrific, so if you are looking at it, please look at the other ratings and ignore Mr. A. Dick Weed's comments.  Wado...may our Creator watch over and bless every one
