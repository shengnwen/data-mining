This is a wonderful quilt book for beginners and for experienced quilters. Choose different fabrics, add blocks to the length and width, and you will have a quilt for a teenager or an adult. I have all three of Ursula Reikes' baby quilt books and love them all. I just completed a baby quilt last month and have a quilt in process for my teenaged niece with the patterns for both courtesy of Ursula Reikes
