What really makes Ms. Murphy's novels so much fun is the way she knows cats.  Joe Gray, Dulcie and the tortoiseshell Kit are fun to spend a few hours with.  They seem so &quot;human&quot; in their dialogues, and the way Murphy gets them to do the crimesolving continues to be clever, resourceful, and highly imaginative.  Now, if that were only true of the humans!  The Senior Survival Club is a nice gesture, but all five ladies are basically interchangeable and sometimes I found myself forgetting who was who.  Vivi Traynor is such a caricature, derivative of any dumb blonde in any mystery novel.  The real mystery is pretty easy to follow, and solve, IF you remember what goes on when Charlie sneaks peeks at the so-called great novelist's current work.  I don't know why Murphy keeps Kate Osbourne's character---she's used very rarely and her connection to the cats, which is pretty awesome if you remember from previous books, is never fully utilized.  Also, there is a little too much description of the areas, the houses, the women's dresses, etc.  I am not trying to be a spoilsport or a nasty critic.  I love cats...our 20 year old feline recently passed away, and we've acquired three new delightful kittens.  I wish I could communicate with them! But, this book is definitely worth reading if you've followed the series.  And thanks to Ms. Murphy for her knowledge of cats and sharing it with us feline lovers
