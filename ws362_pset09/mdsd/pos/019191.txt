I came into this book a bit worried.  I watched and owned all seven season of Buffy, never like Angel (series, not the character)so I was left with a big hole after buffy went off the air.
I tried Rice before but never liked it, so this book was going to be a new try on the genre.
I was gladly suprised.  The story is quite interesting and the way it flows at times it is a bit hard to follow.  I blame this on so many characters for an introductory book.
The main character most of time did not know what was going on, but the reader was quite aware of the situations.  I was gladly surprised with who the killer was, but not happy with two of the deaths in the book (human and vampire, no names so no spoiler here)
I give it four stars because it had too much info at times and too little on some.
I will try the second and third book in the series to see what really happens with Ms. Blake.
Nice reading for Horror / Vampire genr
