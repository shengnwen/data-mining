Sue Grafton's writing is catchy and her characterization is superb.  I don't want to regurgitate what must be countless remarks regarding how great it is to have a believable strong female character, but suffice to say I want to be Kinsey Milhoune when I grow up.

The collection of three is a lot more convenient for someone who plows through books like I do.  I don't have access to a bookstore, so Amazon is my primary source of books right now.  This way I can order the collection and take the time to move through three books while placing the next on order and not have to worry about running out of reading material or dealing with numerous paperbacks taking up space.  Also, even though you can really pick up the books at any time throughout the series, you still get a better sense of continuity this way.
