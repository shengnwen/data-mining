I ordered this book for my very artistic 8-year-old daughter.  Amazon was unable to complete the order.  Just before our annual trip to our timeshare in eastern Maryland, I visited our local library looking for books on CD to listen to on the 8 hour drive.  I was surprised to find the CD version of Chasing Vermeer.  I checked it out, and during the trip we listened.  The plot was somewhat complicated for a young person and I needed to explain parts of it frequently.  We were both drawn into the story and found the main characters very appealing.  The plot involves a long series of unlikely coincidences.  The biggest surprise, however, was that the painting at the center of the mystery, Vermeer's "A Lady Writing," was actually in the National Gallery in Washington, DC.  The National Gallery was already our primay destination for our day trip to the Smithsonian!  Naturally, the first thing we asked upon entering, was "Where are the Vermeers?"  In Gallery 51A we were introduced to Vermeer's masterpiece.  Talk about coincidences!  Also, one of the paintings in the Gallery was labeled "Attributed to Johannes Vermeer!"  Spooky
