Like most of the Tai chi Classics, a lot of the language is ambiguous, but I found it to be an excellent supplement to my tai chi chuan practice. There are some great photos of the author practicing the form with explanations (albeit a little hard to wade through) of martial arts applications.  One particularly useful section tells about the 9 levels of Tai Chi practice - essentially a benchmarking system of what specific areas you ought to be working on, and in what order, in fairly clear language.

Probably not a good 'first exposure' to Tai Chi Chuan, but definitely something that a serious student would want to take a look at
