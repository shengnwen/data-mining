It was quite informative, as modern Iranian art is somehow unknown, and is trying to find a character of its own. But also I have to disagree with the other comment , that Art in Iran is smehow quite different from the rest of the middle east, and it does not portrait the modern "Islamic Art" at all, and to understand Iranian art one has to consider so many other factors, such as the Persian art, and pre-Islamic art, and if you are interested in the art in middle east in GENERAL, then you should buy a book about art in middle east in General
