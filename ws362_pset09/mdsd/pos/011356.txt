I am a fan of Jim Boylan and have enjoyed his previous books, but I particularly liked Getting In. The process of getting accepted into a college becomes an avenue to explore how one presents oneself, what  constitutes success, what motivates us... all in a funny, tender look at  growing up, finding oneself and being true to oneself. Sensitive  understanding of dynamics of parenting, the college admissions process, and  ties that bind in families. An entertaining book that will make you laugh,  and if you are my age, remember when it all seemed so terribly important to  the rest of your life what a college admission officer thought of you
