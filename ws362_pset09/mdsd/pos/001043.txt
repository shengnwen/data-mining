This book is essential if you are considering a career in any aspect of the music business. For example, If you started out with a home studio and want to branch out further, then this is the book for you. If you are a songwriter with a bunch of songs laying around but don't know what to do with them, this book is for you. It is one of the best 20 bucks I have since I began in the music business
