I love the autobiographical touches of this collection.  My favorite story is &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;.  I had many times thought of the naive generosity that Americans exhibit in contrast to Europeans, but had  never been able to put this into words, until i read this story. I did not  care much for parts of the book (the ghost tales, for example), but overall  it is a worthy collection and an enjoyable read
