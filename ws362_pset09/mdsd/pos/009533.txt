Winston Churchill once said that someone who is not a socialist at 20, has no heart, but if he is still a socialist at 30, he has no brain. If only it were that simple! Allan Levite does a terrific job analyzing guilt as the main motivating force of adult socialist/Marxist/ leftist activists -- the ones who just won't quit and who pose real danger to our individual liberties and choices. His book is magnificently researched and full of fresh, original points of view that will appeal to anybody who is fed up with holier-than-thou self-righteousness of the self-proclaimed moral superiors. Unfortunately, Mr. Levite seems too nice of a guy not to mince some points. For example, throughout the book he persistently repeats that the feeling of guilt he is analyzing is political, not psychological. Me thinks, he doth protest too much. This overwhelming guilt that requires dragging others into it, cannot, by definition, avoid being psychological and Freudian (even when it is Judeo-Christian, as Mr. Levite aptly points out), and a British psychologist, Dr. Aric Sigman, has been successfully studying "middle-class guilt" as such. Another small drawback of Mr. Levite's witty and timely book is that once he starts making a point, he will continue making it to death. It is especially painful in the 60-page long Chapter 3, which reads like a veritable Who's Who of the leftist movements.
