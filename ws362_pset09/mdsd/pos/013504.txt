Bruce Lipton's book sheds a great deal of light on the underlying mechanisms of the mind/body interface.  He draws from his background as a cellular biologist, and the research of others, to present an accessible and fascinating description of the response of cells (and life) to the emotional environment.... The writing is clear and enjoyable.... An inspiring book.....  
Research in the field of hypnosis offers further insight and a look at the practical application of this knowledge.  If this is of interest to you consider two excellent books by Ernest Rossi; MIND-BODY THERAPY (with David Cheek Ob/Gyn) and THE PSYCHOBIOLOGY OF MIND-BODY HEALING.  These books are somewhat specific to hypnotherapy, but they also offer a great deal of interest to the general reader
