And nothing like the Alfred Hitchcock film. I guess he just took the basic idea of evil German spies and worldwide conspiracies and formed his own story around it. As it is, it's a fun adventure novel, though a little bit confusing at times.

A bored adverturer called Richard Hannay has a man die in his London apartment and takes off for the cover of the Lothian and Borders countryside before the police and the murders can get him too. Unfortunately the killers are more resourceful than Hannay thinks and follow him. A great number of hair-breadth escapes and strange disguises follow. It's fun stuff and very easy-going. The bit about believing yourself in a role in order to be a really good spy was well done and put to good effect. But I never really understood the end.

What was the deal with the deep rumbling below the beach house and the cloud of chalkish smoke erupting from the basement? What was that German phrase yelled about the Black Stone? It was all on the very last page and I'm afraid it just totally lost me. However it is well written and I did appreciate the couple of references to Sherlock Holmes (my God, in-jokes in 1915).

I hear there are five novels starring Richard Hannay. I have no idea what they are called or where they begin and end but I will surely check them out if I come across them
