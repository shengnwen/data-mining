Gregory likes normal food; eggs, vegetables, fruit, and fish.  Normal food, for a normal kid, right?  Wrong!  You see Gregory isn't exactly normal well not in his family's eyes.   To them, normal food is tin cans, boxes, tires, and mostly garbage.  Well that is normal food...for a goat.  You see, Gregory is a goat and since he likes eggs, vegetables, and fruits his parents think he is sick.  But Gregory just wants to eat what he likes.  So since Gregory and his parents haven't had dinner together in a while (and mothers like to have dinner with they're kids) they decide to take him to Doctor Ram.  Doctor Ram has treated picky eaters before but not like Gregory.  Yet, he comes up with a solution.  That is to feed Gregory what he wants but to sneak in a little bit of garbage every meal...    It is a good moral to the story I think it might teach kids to try stuff before they decide whether or not the like it
