I'm french speaking and I am leaving in Montreal. Few years ago I had read « the business of sewing » by Barbara Wright Sykes, and I realized that this would have been my purpose in life, to become a professional seamstress.  However,I felt that I needed more technics to do so professionally.  So at the age of fifty, I am back to school and I am studying design & patternmaking, I will be done in a few more months.  I have a few little sewing contracts to help me survive in the meantime. These little contracts are in home decor, made to measure pants, skirts, etc.  However, I have realised that I was not able to charge the right amount for my services, especially to my relatives and my earliest friends at work.  I had trouble charging the amount that I truly deserved. In reading this book, it helped me to calculate the right amount I should receive for my work, as well as how to explain to the customer how this worked in the custom making clothes business.  It helped me tremendously and I am recommanding this book to everyone.
