This book for children is about a young plains Indian boy who hears a folk tale about how buffaloes are formed at the bottom of a lake far to the south of the boy's village. He goes in search of the lake and, in so doing,  saves his village from an attack by an enemy tribe. The book was  illustrated by Stephen Gammell and it was a 1982 Caldecott Honor book  (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a book for  children. Any child will love to have the story read to them
