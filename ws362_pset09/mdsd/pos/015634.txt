I've always been fascinated by Bobby Knight.  I always figured that anybody who could lose his temper so violently, make outlandish statements, become involved in numerous controversies, and yet still coach college basketball must have some inspiring things to say.  

And I was right.  Carpenter's book is a short collection of Knight's great quotes on various subjects such as leadership, success, basketball, himself, and his times at Indiana and Army.  The Appendix contains his statement regarding the 1979 "Puerto Rico Incident," which I found to be superfluous.

Some reviewers seem surprised that the book is free from profanity and contains a very positive message.  This quote is well known, but I still like it:  "The will to prepare to win is more important than the will to win."  

Not all of the messages are as inspiring, of course.  Some quotes are purely included for humor, while others simply provide the reader with insight into Knight's character.  Many quotes are not even from Knight himself, but from others in reference to him.  

This book is a very fast read -- athletes and other readers may find it especially interesting.  
One thing fans will notice is the book is somewhat out of date --there is no mention of Knight's Texas Tech years.  

Knight's fans and supporters will like this book, and it would make a great small gift/stocking stuffer for that purpose.
