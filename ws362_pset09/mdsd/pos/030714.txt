Wow.  Someone called this book reader friendly.  ::blink, blink::  I don't know about that.  What I do know is that it is a tremendous resource for the LIS professional.  Like probably every other MLIS/MLS student in America, I bought this book for one of my early courses.  I read snippets.  I skimmed mercilessly.  I snored repeatedly, but I learned copiously.  Buy it if you must.  Borrow it if you have the chance.  Don't skip it unless you have to
