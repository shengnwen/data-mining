This book is very entertaining and hard to put down.  The dark images that Murray creates keep you entranced in the novel.  You find yourself continuously wondering how and why this Katherine character can do or say the things she does, and all the while you feel you can relate to her on some level.  

The author uses bits of history to enhance the novel, like when Katherine imagines Amerigo Vespucci and Chistopher Columbus arguing over dinner.  

All in all, this book is a wonderful journey into the mind of a unique young woman with disturbing tendencies, and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to read about people with less than perfect personalities
