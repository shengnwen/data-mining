I live as a Druid and not really as a Wiccan.I am not a fan of the Farrer's books,yet this one is different.I was impressed by their keen understanding of the Wiccan holy-days and nature-sabbats.For two neo-pagans,like the Farrers,who have studied years of Pagan-Gardineren,this is an accurate look at the modern celebrations of the four seasons and four mezzo-seasons.-What i disagree with the Farrers mostly on, is their philosophical topic of combining Christianity with Paganism.(Not mentioned ,but implied in their other writings.)To me,it's like mixing oil and water,in a jar.When watching the jar being shaken,it appears to have gelled.But,when the agitation stops,it's clear that they are two distinct elements,that can not be combined.This book is hard-cover,and not a flimsy paperback! It has that classy British tone and not a base attitude about it.Glossary included.
