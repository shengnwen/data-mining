This book has been a very handy reference. The Greek myths are presented in plain English, and written in chronological order, so they can be enjoyed separately or as a single, unbroken narrative. Citations from numerous sources are given after each story. Robert Graves notes even minor variations on each myth, and the notes that follow give some of the historical basis in which the myth may be rooted. Well worth the cost
