This book is far better than the first in the series.  I was completely sucked into the characters, concept, and plot.  The device of the alien child - a hybrid that is different from humans in obvious but also extremely subtle ways - is a unique creation in sci fi.  His journey is fascinating and cruel, which makes a dark philospical statement on human nature.  The dialogue is as excellent as you would expect from any fine novelist
