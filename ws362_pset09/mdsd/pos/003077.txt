This is the first written material that I have been exposed to that actually attempts to quantify (not just qualify) the possibility of unexplained phenomena in a truly scientific manner.  It's the most depth I have seen any psychologist reach while studying the difference between the internally self-generated/projected vs. the possibility of externally autonomous psychological occurrences.  For one who is involved in self-exploration, this particular work can be the catalyst for much inner growth & development.  Be ready for Jung's abstract writing style, & have a dictionary & highlighter on hand for some fun & enlightening reading
