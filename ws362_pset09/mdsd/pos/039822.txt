This is the 19th century's version of "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus".  Delightfully funny, irreverent and very tasteful, "The Diaries of Adam and Eve" is a succinctly written description of the vast differences in world views between men and women.  
I always give this book as a wedding gift, to assist newlyweds in understanding that though one has married a "Stranger From A Strange Land", each can find great pleasure, happiness and success from learning the other's language.  
Twain is so readable, one would think he wrote for a twenty first century audience. I highly recommend this short book to anyone.
