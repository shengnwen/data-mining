CARRY TIGER TO MOUNTAIN: THE TAO OF ACTIVISM AND LEADERSHIP pairs a modern interpretation of Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching to Western leadership goals and values, considering how these principles can be applied in a new era of spirituality in activism. Experiences of present leaders of social causes blend with the author's own decades of experience as a social and political activist: from mistakes to ego in organizational management, everything is covered.
