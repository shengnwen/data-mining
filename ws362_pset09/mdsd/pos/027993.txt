This is a dramatic and tense story of a young law school graduate who gets a job offer that is too good to be true.  Of course, it turns out that he doesn't get the full story until after he accepts the job.  The rest of the story entails the exciting efforts to get him and his wife out of their desperate situation.  Like most Grisham novels, this is a fun and fast read that many readers would classify as light fiction.
 
Many people are familiar with the story through the movie.  The book is significantly different from the movie; if you have seen the movie you will probably still enjoy the book and be consistently surprised throughout the second half of the story.
