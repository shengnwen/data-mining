Macaulay's Towers is clever and generally a joy to read. A familiarity with classical near east history helps but is not absolutely necessary; an appreciation of strains of high church Christian theology is almost essential.  I especially liked Aunt Dot, who appears in the bulk of the book.  When she takes a sabbatical, I found my attention wandering; the fantastic bits with long camel rides and driving monkeys did not appeal to me.  The underlying theme of the book deals with how ones religion is manifested in ones life, and the author's views are sophisticated.  Much is made of interplays between traditional Christianity and Islam; evangelical Christianity makes a minor appearance, and a few basic issues of feminism are sprinkled throughout.  The book does a fine job in identifying many of the troubles which continue to plague the Levant in the present era.  Recommended
