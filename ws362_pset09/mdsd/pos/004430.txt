A wonderful book for young children about dreaming/hoping. With few words it gets its point across. Illustrations are incredibly varied and wonderful--I especially love the ones of the musicians! However, I am  troubled by the drawing of Ben's father and his friends gambling and  drinking--seems to add to stereotypical notions; I'd love to discuss it w/  the author/illustrator
