    King of the Wind is a great book by Marguerite Henry.  It is about a mute boy named Agba and his horse Sham.  Agba goes with Sham on many adventures together.  Agba goes with Sham from the royal stables in Morocco to Gog Magog.  Sham also sires many winning foals and when he is gone, Agba goes back to Morocco.
    I enjoyed this book very much.  I liked it because it is about horses.  I also liked it because it was full of adventure.  It was sad and exciting and there were many parts where Sham and Agba were seperated.  Agba was very brave for a young, mute boy and Sham kept him company with his firy spirit that only Agba could control.
    My favorite part was when the cook tried to drive Sham.  He wanted to show that he did not need Agba to drive Sham.  He left Agba at the royal kitchens then set out.  Sham bidded his time till the cart was groaning with goods and a young pig.  Then "BAM!"  He went wild and ran like the wind, sending the goods, the pig, and the cook into the air.  The cook runs after first the pig, then Sham, then the pig, until he is so confused that he catched nither.  In the end the apple woman cathes Sham and the cook is so fustrated that he sells Sham to a cruel man.  I like this part best because it is so funny and shows Shams firy nature.
