This is an excellent, cost-effective, professional-quality reference book for lay people just starting to explore the world of aromatherapy. Ms. Rose includes sections on latin names and botanical classifications, which are very helpful in understanding the provenance of the oils in the book.
The Guide itself is a pretty exhaustive list of oils, and includes the chemical components of each oil as well as descriptions of the oil's appearance and smell. Ms. Rose does not waste our money with full-page color plates of plants most of us are unlikely to ever see!
I also highly recommend Kurt Shnaubelt's "Advanced Aromatherapy" as a companion volume to this book. Dr. Schnaubelt explains more of the chemistry behind the oils and includes some safety information that is sadly lacking from Ms. Rose's book. Like one of the reviewers of one of her other books, I downgraded a star because of safety information that I felt was either incomplete or conflicted with other professional sources I have researched.
I also recommend Prima Fleur Oils, mentioned in her "sources" section, as an ethical and fairly-priced Essential Oil supplier. These days, everyone is selling essential oils and it's hard to know what kind of product you're getting. These guys are the real deal
