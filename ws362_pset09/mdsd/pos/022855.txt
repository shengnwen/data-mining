Game Theory is a social science devised by John von Neuman, one of the 20th centuries most brilliant minds.  Basically, game theory is the study of human behavior and rationality when presented with choices.  It helps us predict how people will react, given their situation, and what they have to gain/lose through each choice.
The book is both an explanation of game theory and a miniature biography of von Neuman's life.  Von Neuman worked on the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bomb during World War II.  Most scientists feared the power of the bomb, and knew that even though it was necessary, it would cause a lot more problems than it would solve.  However, von Neuman's own beliefs, which were influenced by game theory, were a bit different than most of his colleagues.
The book, using interesting examples, gives us a crash course in game theory, with a focus on prisoner's dilemmas.  A prisoner's dilemma is a problem where you and an opponent are pitted against each other, and you each must make a choice to either help each other out or turn on the other.  It would be most beneficial for both to cooperate.  However, if you cooperate and your opponent betrays you, the consequences are the worst.  Therefore, it is only rational to betray your partner.
This is one of the most interesting books that I've read in a very long time, and it has definitely made me take a second look at how things in my life have in the past and could in the future turn out.  If you want to learn something fun and useful, Prisoner's Dilemma is definitely for you
