This is the best book I have read about animals in the Bible. Its easy to follow and understand. She explains what the different translations mean and where to find them. It proves that Animals are a very special to God and have a great purpose here on earth as well as in the afterlife. What a huge comfort and blessing this book has been to me after the loss of my special Thumpy kitty.. I always felt animals would be in heaven but I met others that did not so Im happy to have all the facts. And the answer to that Question is "Yes" we will see them again!! God Bless you M. Jean Holmes for this beautiful book and the photo on the cover is just breath taking and dreamy!
