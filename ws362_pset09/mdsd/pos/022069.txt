This drug reference is layed out in a simple easy to use pattern. Every office should acquire this book. We just check the index, get the page number, flip to the appropiate page and wham! everything we need is right  there. I especially like how the dental considerations are listed  seperately. And it's a lot easier to manage than the huge PDR. It makes  life much easier
