This is a good book on directX 9. Yes there are some rough points I would like to mention. First off , the author does change some of her code in the source files, which I myself found to be annoying. but she does a great job covering directx, and if you wade it out, you will find a great instructional manual.The material is solid, and it successfully covers a lot of ground. 

Chapter 2 covers getting directx up and running. 
Chapter 3 covers sprites. 
Chapter 4 covers vertex buffers.
Chapter 5 covers Projections and matrices
Chapter 6 covers materials and lighting
Chapter 7 covers  meshes
Chapter 8 covers particles
Chapter 9 covers dinput
Chapter 10 covers dsound, and 
Chapter 11 Has a project that wraps it all together

This is a great introduction to game programming as wel
