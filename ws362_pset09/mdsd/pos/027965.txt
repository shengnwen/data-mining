Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book.  I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender.  I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side.  The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie.  In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen.

As an aside, I remain amazed and impressed that Iles can so effectively write a  novel in the first person in which the character speaking is a female sufferring from the effects of  sexual abuse.


Not a five star, but a solid four.
