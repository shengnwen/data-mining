Although I have to acknowledge the wonderful use of language that Joyce displays in this work of fiction, I found that I had a great deal of trouble getting into it.  This is a coming of age story and perhaps it would hold more relevance for a male than it did for me.  There is some dispute as to whether or not this is an autobiographical story or not.  What is is a "stream-of-consciousness narrative" and it is a style that Joyce is credited with developing in his body of work.  The book centres around young Stephen, and his changing viewpoints as he grows up.  We see how an innocent' idealistic youth changes his ideas as he matures and as life happens to him.  It leads him to question his Catholicism  and his idea of family values.  The language is what is really beautiful about this story!  I had a bit of difficulty getting into the story, but felt that it was an important enough work to persevere
