Anyone wanting to have a structured prayer life I highly recommend  Book of Common Prayer.  It is a beautiful book and  praying the psalms helps deepen one^s spiritual life.  The Lectionary gives you the daily readings of the church.  It is an ecumenical book with many beautiful and inspiring prayers.  This is a book that will give you much thought for meditation.  I highly recommend it. The book is for morning and evening prayer
