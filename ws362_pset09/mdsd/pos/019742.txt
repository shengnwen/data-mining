From page 185 & 186,

"In 1845, the newly inaugurated Democratic president, James K. Polk, moved to annex the Mexican territory of Texas as the twenty-eighth state."

"Seizing on the specter of foreign aggression as his pretext, President Polk authorized the hostile takeover of Texas in 1845." 

"A wide swath of citizens from all parties condemned the invasion as an act of despotism--most famously, Henry David Thoreau, who penned the essay 'On Civil Disobedience' in protest." 

The annexation of Texas involved no "hostile takeover" or "invasion" of any territory.  In 1845, Texas (an independent nation since its successful war of independence from Mexico in 1836) applied for, and was granted, statehood in the Union. 

Thoreau's "On Civil Disobedience," published in 1849, was a protest of America's later war with Mexico (1846-1848) with its invasion and annexation of Mexican territory.  While the war with Mexico did grow out of Texas' admission to the Union, they were two distinct events.

I'm halfway through this book, and for the most part I'm impressed, but basic historical errors like the above make me wonder what other mistakes may be lurking in the text.
