I picked up this book just as the board of directors of the local theater group sent me to set up a campaign to raise capital for a new building. All of a sudden I was faced with the idea of raising lots of money instead of just the small amounts we need to put on individual productions. 

To my surprise, although I guess I shouldn't have been, Chapter 7 is on Capital Campaigns. She summarizes them as: 'unique, occasional, exhausting, exciting, and productive; they focus organizations on a particular goal during a finite period of time and allow us to sharpen our sense of purpose and impact.' To that I can only say: Yup! 

Ms. Grace has obviously been there, done that, not only in raising money for capital, but every other kind of fundraising activity as well. 

This book is well written, and it positioned at a higher level than most fundraising books. By that I mean that she treats fundraising as almost an art form. Something where you don't need to feel like you're begging for a handout. Highly recommended
