This book was yet another good one from sidney sheldon.The story is about two women ,Noelle and Catherine who both fall in love with the same man Larry.Larry promises noelle that he would marry her but then he has told it to many women.Noelle beleives him and then realises what had happened and then seekes revenge on Larry who is married to Catherine in a different country.Another important character in this story is that of Constantine Demeris who is a very rich Greek man and Noelle uses him without his knowledge to destroy Larry.
  Also  I would like to point out the mistake that Sidney Sheldon has made : on page 246 in 'the other side of midnight it is told that Melina (Demeris's wife)told her outraged parents that Demeris had many affairs. But in ' memories of midnight' (part two in this two part series) on page 47 it is told that Melina lost both her parents when she was thirteen . How can this be???
