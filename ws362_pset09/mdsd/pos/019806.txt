This is a really interesting book.  It gives you a guided tour through video game history by looking at and discussing the art of many historic games.  The book has lots and lots of color pictures from popular video games, and offers running commentary on their importantance. Also there are several brief interviews with artists that worked on some of these projects.  They share some of their philosophies of character development.  There is also some brief discussion about character development workflow.

This book isn't so much instructional as it is inspirational.  I don't think you can read (or skim) through this book without getting some new, fresh, ideas of characters for your own game
