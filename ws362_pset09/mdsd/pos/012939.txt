Dave Barry writes as though he were Elmore Leonard on speed.  It is hard to say exactly where the plot loses and contact with reality and possibility, but at the end you have to sit back and laugh and blow a sigh of satisfaction and relief that such things cannot happen, such people cannot actually exist.  Quite.  Like Leonard, Barry's characters get their motivations, a lot of them, from the draw of the illegal, the desire to make big quickly.  They are such strange people, each one perhaps, just, possible, and yet thrown together they interact in ways that could never be real.  And Barry keeps the entire thing just teetering on the edge between hysteria and tragedy, leaving his readers poised to fall either way, and laughing the entire time, both from the absurd humour and from relief.  I don't know how many other books Barry has since written, novels, i mean, not his humour columns (this was his debut fiction), but i shall have to read them and leave his newspaper offerings alone.  They, the columns, aren't even in the same realm, let alone league
