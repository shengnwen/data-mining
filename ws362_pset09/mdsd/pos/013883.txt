This book was witty, relatable, and well written.  Reading Ned's stories is like reading about the kids in your school- and if you're out of school already I bet you remember kids like him (maybe it was you?).  The characters jump off the pages and you will find yourself smirking in every chapter.  Since the stories are at least partially real (quasi autobiography) none of the characters get overly steriotyped which makes it all the more believable.  I hope he writes a book about his college experiences
