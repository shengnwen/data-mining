This novel grippingly illustrates how money changes everything -- people, in particular -- regardless of how good or amoral they were to begin with.  Scott Smith does an excellent job demonstrating how one simple situation can snowball into a catastrophe and how one small irreversible action can lead an ordinarily good man down a path into the darker side of his soul.

I've always preferred reading a book first, before seeing its film adaptation and I'm glad that's what I did with this one.  I don't think a movie-goer can better see -- and feel -- the moral struggles and the characters' humanity than anyone reading this book.  The author really takes you into the lead character Hank Mitchell's mind and makes you want to stay there until you finish his story.
