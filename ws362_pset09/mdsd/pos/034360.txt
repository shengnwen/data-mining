Brother Akil posits what those who have some semblance of a clue in the BLAK nation know, as to who is responsible for the BLAK nation's condition.  Using the theology of Master Fard Muhammad(GOD in person), and his messenger, Elijah Muhammad, Akil codifies the healing message that BLAK peole need.  To those persons who attempt to discredit this work as racists, blaming white peole for the BLAK nation's condition, and or trying to belittle Akil's work, I ask you the question; Is what Akil says true or not?  If it isn't true, then disprove what he says scientifically or be quiet in your rage and hypocrisy; it's gotten very old. To WE the original people of the earth, this is good medicine in helping to facilitate our healing and repairing the damage that our 6,000 year old enemy has done to us
