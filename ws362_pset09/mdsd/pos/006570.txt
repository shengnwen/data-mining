I read this book more for the insight into North Korea as a society then for the mystery aspect as I mostly read non-fiction.  The story is told inline with the main character, Inspector O, being interviewed by a Western Intelligence agent about the events that took place.  So you get the real-time events interspersed with the interview that looks back at what transpired and sometimes foreshadows events that will take place later in the story.  The mystery is layered in the complexity of the different North Korean military, intelligence and police organizations and in the process reveals a lot of what life is really like. An excellent book for a first time author.
