After bravely sacrificing her most valued possession to end her tribe's suffering, a young girl awakens to find a reward of her selflessness--thick clusters of vivid blue flowers spread all over the Texas hills.  In  dePaola's The Legend of the Bluebonnet, an unseasonably long drought  orphaned the Native American girl, leaving her with only memories and a  warrior doll.  Yet, when the Great Spirits request a sacrifice to restore  life to Earth, She-Who-Is-Alone courageously volunteers her doll as the  burnt offering and scatters its ashes to the wind.  This wonderful tale of  Comanche folklore explains the origin of the bluebonnet, the Texas state  flower, while paying homage to the Comanche value and respect for family,  community, and Earth.  DePaola's powerful retelling and majestic full-page  paintings compliment each other, capturing the traditions of Comanche  people and Texas landscape.  Realistic and engaging use of language,  singing &quot;Great Spirits, the land is dying.  Tell us what we have done  to anger you&quot; maintains the flavor of oral tradition.  The writing  attends to cultural songs, dances, and prayers; while the illustrations  depict cultural dress and lifestyle.  In his thorough source note, dePaola  mentions his tireless research in an effort to accurately portray the  Comanche customs and base the legend on the original Indians.  The Legend  of the Bluebonnet appeals to children of younger ages with its simple  language and graphic pictures; its pourquoi nature satisfies even adult  readers
