This book is worth reading for liberals and conservatives alike.  I'm not, in the end, convinced that Kekes has made his case against liberalism.  (I think that liberals can answer all of his charges) but he presents interesting challanges that liberals must consider.  He's much more rigerous than most conservatives and actual makes arguments rather than just fighting staw men or expressing his own opinion.  It's a good book both for liberals, to see what a sophisticated conservative challange to liberalism looks like, and also for conservatives who are dissatisfied with the relatively simple-minded views of someone like Kristol or Buckley (anyone who thinks that Rush Limbaugh is worth listening too will probably not be smart enough to get the book!
