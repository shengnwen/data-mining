It surprises me that few of the reviewers have focused on Joyce's understanding and practice of feminism.  There are many different types of feminism:  eco, radical, liberal, marxist, and so forth.  I might call Joyce a practical feminist -- someone believes in positive activities that meet women where they ARE instead of focusing on where they SHOULD be.  She is very rarely nasty, strident, shrill, or mean about what she believes, which is a refreshing attitude.  I appreciate the phrase "free woman" tremendously, as the notion of freedom also carries with it the notion of responsibility.  Free women are responsible women...which means that they are strong and loving women as well.
