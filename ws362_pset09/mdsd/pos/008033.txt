In this book, Alfred P. Sloan tells the story of his years as president and CEO of General Motors.  His story is relevant for anyone who needs advice on how to save a company that is on the verge of bankruptcy and get it growing.  Sloan has divulged his insights on organizational structure, management processes, financial control, product strategy and research.  Here is some of the advice he offers:

	Balance cooperation and control:  Sloan implemented a framework of coordinated policy and decentralized operations.  Top managers made policy, and individual business units were free to implement the policy in the way they wanted.  He created interdivisional committees to ensure continuity. 
	Management.  Rather than expecting managers to behave like drill sergeants, Sloan pushed for "selling" at all levels.  Corporate leaders were expected to sell their policy decisions to divisions.  Division managers were encouraged to sell operational initiatives to top management.
	Finances.  Sloan created a system for reviewing appropriation requests to control spending.  He also created a system of four-month forecasts to make sure the size of inventory did not exceed the needs of production.
	Product Strategy.  Sloan developed a marketing strategy for General Motors to offer an automobile for every price range.  The company had previously been stuck offering cars only in the mid-price range, and had lost considerable market share to Ford.
	Research.  Sloan recognized that research was just as important as manufacturing and put both research and operations on the same organizational plane.
	Distribution.  Sloan turned automobile dealers into business partners and simplified the process of distribution for General Motors.  He also created GMAC, a financing entity that allowed the "average man" to buy a car and pay in installments.  When he began this program, banks refused to lend money to working people to buy automobiles, considering them a bad risk
