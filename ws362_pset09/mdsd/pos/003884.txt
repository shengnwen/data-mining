Louis Berkhof's 'Systematic Theology" has been the standard theology text for Presbyterian/Reformed thinkers since it was first published in the 50's.

In fact, I cannot think of a better Reformed Systematic Theology text than this one (other than, perhaps, Charnock's work). If you want to gain a better grasp of the overall theology of Presbyterians and reformed/Calvinistic thinkers, then this is just about the only text you need (other than maybe Calvin's Institutes).

Berkhof details the reformed view regarding the doctrines of God (His existence, knowability, relation of being/attributes, names, along with the works of God which include the teachings of reformed predestination), the doctrine of man in relation to God (original sin, anthropology of man, sin, etc.), Christology, Soteriology, Church Government, the Work of Redemption and its Applications, and much more. 

This is the most detailed reformed systematic theology text of the 20th century. If you have ever wondered what the differences are between Dispensationalism and Covenant theology, then this text will provide a great review of the Covenant Theology which the reformers hold. The issues of reformed Soteriology are detailed in about 100 pages or more, and the reformed views of the means of grace as seen in the sacraments are covered in great detail as well.

Berkhof has a writing style that can sometimes be difficult to follow, but with a little effort, every chapter in this text is easily understood. As is the case with any good 'systematic' text, the information is formatted in a concise but also compact (meaning not too much in each section as to allow the reader to get lost) way that makes for easing reading and comprehension.

In my theology collections, I rank this text in the top 20 of systematic theology texts and I highly recommend this work to Seminary students and lay people alike.
