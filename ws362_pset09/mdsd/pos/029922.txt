While my book club enjoyed this book, and it did give us a lot to talk about, I think that the writer missed several key points. Firstly, the mother is unsympathetic b/c she just wallows in her grief instead of trying to help her (assumedly) surviving children deal with it. It's like the writer assumed that since she lost a child, the mother must be sympathetic. Instead, she's merely pathetic. Also, I found the blase racial slurs, like the Japanese one above, offensive. Also, there were numerous typos that should have been caught by a proofreader.
