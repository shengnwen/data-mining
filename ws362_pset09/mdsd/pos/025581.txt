Feinman does a nice jobe of presenting the basic organization of law as taught in the US. However, there are certain biases that are seen by what is included and what is not. In addition, issues of controversy, such as tort reform and abortion, are touched upon in a less-than-even-handed manner. I suspect that this is a fair reflection of how these controverisies are presented in the nation's law schools, but Feinman's audience is different, and I would think requires a more open-minded approach. Overall, a good book that lives up to its billing.
