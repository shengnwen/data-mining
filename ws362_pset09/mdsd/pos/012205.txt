Itten, himself is one of the greatest color theorist of our century, and the masterful mind behind the Bauhaus School.

In this book Itten describes his color theory and the facts of his famous "Color Star", which is one of the most strongest tools for color harmony for designers and alike.

Most color books have samples of color harmonies you choose from when you design, or talk about complementary colors, but cant tell you why u use such combinations or so.

If you have an analytical approach to design, rather than just copying what others do, you will love this book. You will begin to understand the language of colors.

Have u ever heard of "the Seven Color Contrast", if not then it is time for you to get familiar about it.

This book is an evaluation of Ittens masterpiece "Art of Color". The chapter on subjective experience of color is very limited in this book.

If you are willing to invest more on color matters buy "Art of Color" 

If you are happy to stay with the basics then this book is adequate for your purposes.
