Gallows View was my first inspector Banks mystery and I have to say that I enjoyed it thoroughly.  A peeping-tom incident, and a murder and several house burglaries occur in the same time period in their quiet neighborhood, and inspector Banks begins to wonder if they are not related despite any apparent connection.  Banks solicits the service of a beautiful psychologist to help get into the mind of the peeping tom and begins to fall in love with her.  Meanwhile the pressure for him to solve the case escalates when it is his wife becomes the next victim... 
A good read for fans of the mystery genre as there are plenty of twists and turns and the reader is guessing until the very end.  Gallows View is definitely worth a view on a rainy night in my opinion.
