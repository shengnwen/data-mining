Everyone knows this event was controversial.  It is the tasting that allowed premium U.S. wineries to begin the meteoric rise in quality (and price) that we see today.  Arguably, it is what launched the globe's infatuation with the "New World Style".

This is the story as told by the most reliable source available.  Author George Tabor was the only journalist to attend this epochal event in 1976.  He was a young journalist in Paris at a time when ex-pats gathered at the events held by British Wine Merchant, Steven Spurrier.  

When Spurrier organized a daytime competition between the wines of California and France, no journalists answered the invitation.  It is lucky for the U.S. wine industry that Tabor decided to attend at the last minute, or the results of this tasting would surely have been re-written by the shocked and embarrassed judges.  A great read for anyone who loves wine and/or history
