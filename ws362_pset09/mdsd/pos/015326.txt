I purchased this copy of the gita because I wanted a simple, accurate translation of the gita. This slim volume gives me precisely that, with an excellent explanatory introduction, and brief chapter introductions.

What I like most is his sensible perspective - there is little bias and what is said is just enough to allow the reader to grasp the deeper significance of the words in the gita, making the reading an active and exciting process. I believe this is how the Gita is to be read, no matter how much accurate and helpful analysis is available, because the value gained from the words is  in discovering these insights for yourself. 

There is a little bias in his interpretation. While he elaborates on Sankhya and Jnana, his views on the exalted status of Karma and Bhakti show clearly. I also feel some principles have been toned down. The ultimate goal of the Gita is a state beyond likes and dislikes, and external enjoyments. Were the whole world to collapse or attain some form of utopia, the realized soul would be undisturbed. Easwaran's suggestions fall far short of that state, for though caring for the world is noble, it too is a source of attachment and misery. Therefore, Easwaran's guide is best for beginners, and that too only those who are instinctively attracted to karma yoga and bhakti yoga.

I encourage you to start or supplement your study of the gita. I give it four starts purely because I feel the devanagiri script is essential. Hardly a problem for those who are interested only in the english translation
