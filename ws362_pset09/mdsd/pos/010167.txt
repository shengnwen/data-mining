I would just like to comment on how thrilled I am with &quot;The Doctors Book of Food Remedies&quot; ! My husband and I are big believers in natural healing and preventative medicine and we have found this book an excellent  resource. It explains in detail the different benefits of many common foods  and it is very easy to understand. I also thought the index is very  thorough and it is very easy to look up a specific condition. I also liked  the fact that recipes are included at the back of each chapter, which show  how easily these foods can be incorporated into your diet. We have  purchased other  books in the past that have talked about the healing power  of foods but none of them have been nearly as comprehensive and easy to  use. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in  improving their health. It is a great resource
