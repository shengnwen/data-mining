Eat less calories and burn more of them through exercising.  It sounds simple, but it's not easy to do.  So I turned to South Beach diet. I've found this to be a very practical diet. After the initial first two weeks (the strictest) I've lost about 5 pounds. But, I've done no exercise whatsoever and have eating quite a bit which accounts for the lower than the average weight loss.  Check the net for more FREE info
