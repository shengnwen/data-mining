If you are looking for a feel good book, this is not it. But if you are looking to understand how powerful people think and work, this will give you a glimpse into how they use others. Without moral judgements and prejudice, Robert Greene disects historical and literary examples of how people use other people for good or ill. Whether you are looking to use others or just avoid being used, this is good place to start. The game of power unvarnished in all its ugliness.
