I am an owner of a few rental properties which I kind of stumbled upon but which have provided me with some steady income.  I was intrigued and decided to pick up Mr. Loftis' book.

My experience has been in lower class neighborhoods.  While Mr. Loftis touches upon investing in areas such as those, he prefers to buy triplexes/fourplexes in "yuppie" areas.  He clearly states that the monthly income from the lower class areas is usually higher, but that the appreciation in the higher end areas more than makes up for that.  

Loftis' explanation is quite detailed.  He explains how to use the GRM to help you find a suitable property.  By fixing up your property in a high GRM neighborhood, you can build considerable equity.  

He also explains how he chooses his renters and has some example leases that you can use.  He debunks some of the "wisdom" spewed out by many of the real estate "gurus".  He explains how to use a 1031 exchange to free up some capital for further investment and how you can use refinancing to do the same.  

In short, there is everything here to get you started on your way to being a successful residential multifamily property investor.  Give the book a try..
