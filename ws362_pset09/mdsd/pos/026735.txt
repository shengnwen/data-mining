I must agree with a number of other reviewers here...don't start your reading of Dickens with this one, but once you start, you need to add this one to your list.  This is not one of Dickens' most noted works, but it is one that needs to be read to understand the authors evolution as a writer.  I had the pleasure (?) of first reading this one in a volume, years ago, which was printed in the late 1800s and which was printed for mass distribution.  Fine print, two columns per page, printing all the way to the page edge...you get the picture.  That was years ago...I am too old to even see the print now, much less read it, but it was worth it at the time and is certainly worth it now that I can afford a nicer copy.  The work can be criticized, with some justification, for being a bit wordy, but for my taste, that is one of the charms of the novel.  It certainly fits the times and the style of the times.  Recommend this one be added to your list when again you get into the Dickens thing.
