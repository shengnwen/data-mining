I read this book after watching the movie (staring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio). Before I started I knew I liked the story, but I didn't realize how much. I loved reading Abagnale's account of his life of crime. I enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot, a doctor, a professor, and a lawyer. I also liked the novel's open frankness about the author's misdeeds. 

However, I thought the book was not especially well written. Abagnale recounts his adventures dryly and with little emotion. I also felt somewhat deprived with the novel's ending. Frank Abagnale went on to work for law enforcement and securities firms, but that is only mentioned in a question and answer with the author after the story. I would have liked to have heard more about how he crossed from the wrong side of the law to the right.

All in all, I would recommend this book as an easy weekend read
