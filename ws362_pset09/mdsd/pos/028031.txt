I read this book some time ago, then read everything else by the author, then read this again. Both times I was stunned by the power, the honesty, the poetry, the passion, and the raw talent of Ms. Yamanaka's writing. I felt that I was in the presence of a major new literary voice and looked for the recognition I was sure she would receive nationally. Instead I fear that this book and others did not receive enough attention because the author happens to be from Hawaii, rather than, say, New York or L.A. I'm a writer myself and can only wish I had a tenth of the ability of this writer. I think Blu's hanging is a classic
