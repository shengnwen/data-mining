This material is very valuable for someone who is just learning about how to network-- especially for young adults, new college graduates, etc.  We use this material as a standard part of a curriculum on networking we do for college women.  It's true that we don't use or recommend his exact tools but a large part of learning about how to network is adopting the mentality of recognizing the opportunities, and of recognizing reciprocity.  I think his material is inspiring and fun to listen to, and I highly recommend it for "beginners".  His examples of networking success and networking blunders are eye opening.  I like this material, and I recommend it
