Blackmask is to be commended for republishing a lot of pulp era fiction which has gone public domain.  The downside is that apparently they seek out a copy of the original, scan it and then OCR the images.  This causes a lot of typos; in this book, for instance, the word "time" is almost always rendered as "tune", and sometimes you have to figure out that "bun" means "him".  Of course these are all real words, so they are not caught by spellcheck..

That aside, this is an engaging little mystery, and perhaps the Chicagoest book I have read.  Brown gives you enough clues to figure out more or less what's going on, but the real draw is the engaging character of Sweeny.

One reviewer below called the book homophobic.  I think that's an overstatement.  A book from 1949 is not going to have a modern view of homosexuality, but the atitude is very "live and let live", and Sweeny does come to respect the shop-keeper a bit.

Is it hard-boiled or an action thriller?  Not really.  Sweeney is a man of culture as much as deeds, and is only really in danger once, but Brown makes shoe-leather as interesting as shoot-outs
