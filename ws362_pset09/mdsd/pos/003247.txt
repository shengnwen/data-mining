I love this book. I am struck by its simplicity. How can a book be so simple, yet so clear in delivering the message, in a topic that is considered to be complicated? Computer architecture is not easy, but with the help of this book I was able to build a very solid foundation when I took the course. And even though it is an introductory book, I still refer to it in more advanced courses and related topics.
