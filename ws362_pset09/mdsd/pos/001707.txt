There are two problems with this book. The first is that it should have been longer. For the first four hundred pages Wolfe builds up our interest in a host of great characters. The book shows every inch of Wolfe's narrative abilities and he delivers a terrific page-turning pace. But then he seems to tire and all the loose ends are clumsily tied up as the last page nears. Up to that point the book had been wonderful - as good as the Bonfire of the Vanities and more believable than a Man in Full. The second problem is that Wolfe seems to lose his nerve with the subject. Why doesn't he subject the odious Quat to the sort of biting satire that the Reverend Bacon received in Bonfire of the Vanities? You know that a satirist has lost his way when he starts picking only on the easy targets
