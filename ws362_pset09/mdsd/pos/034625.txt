I first learned of this book when my oldest daughter started grad school.  It was a tremendous aid for her, and I decided that whenever I got around to grad school, I would read it again.

Second and subsequent readings have proven to me that this is the best tool any student can have.  I recommend it often.  It was just as vital to my daughters years ago when I first read it, and it is still timnely - - right now.   

You cannot expect one book to cover everyone's area of interest, but you can find whatever you need in general or specific terms for any degree being pursued.    It is just a guide - - with many helpful ideas and tips to help get you through - - or at least make you start thinking, and motivate you to research deeper.  It is not a cure-all type of book that can cover every single subject that every single person needs but it provides the impetus to look further.   I have 3 copies - - 2 of which I loan - - the other is MINE ONLY
