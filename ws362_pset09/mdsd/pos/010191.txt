in an age where it seems to be accepted that ronald reagan won the cold war against the evil and godless commies, it was wonderful to see such an openminded history.  walker tells it like it is, regardless of what the american establishment would want you to think.  which isn't at all to say that this book glorifies the ussr... stalin's purges and gulag are given due space, as are the atrocities of eastern europe.  but walker does not shy away from dean acheson and john dulles's dishonest exaggerations of the soviet threat, reagan's illegal wars and democracy-toppling, the stupidity and moral hypocricy of vietnam, and the strongly political machinations behind the scenes in washington.  walker has done his research, and his arguments are fact-based through and through.  the only person who really comes out seeming good is mikhail gorbachev, although even he was eventually phased out by his own revolution.  definitely worth looking into, especially if you want to be able to understand the cold war objectively
