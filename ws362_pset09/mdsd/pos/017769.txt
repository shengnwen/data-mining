As a long-time practitioner of Zen I am always interested in new Zen books. This one does an excellent job of communicating the deeper essence of Zen. This is always a challenge for writers because Zen is beyond words, something to be experienced. This book points readers in the right direction. It also offers a great deal of information about the topic so that readers will come to have a sense of the variety of experiences and areas where Zen makes itself known.  The authors teach in the traditional way with Zen stories to lead the reader toward an inner experience. They also provide exercises, meditations, arts, and other ways for people to find an iroad that speaks personally to them. For anyone interested in learning Zen or in deepening their experience, I highly recommend this book
