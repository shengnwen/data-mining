I like John Rubenstein's readings of Kellerman's many crime novels, which have continuity with old and new characters.

I listen to the audio versions on c.d. & cassette, and don't need the printed versions.

It's a pleasure to let Rubinstein do the heavy eye-lid lifting.

These novels tell everything I wanna know about Los Angeles-- more than is necessary but I luv Kellerman's trivia as much as anybody can.

Hey, I'm now an expert on Detroit too, thanks to Loren Estleman's crime novels.

The gifted writer cleverly weaves in clues and plot developments via conversations in 
 coffee shops, utilizing personalities of waitresses, defenses/offenses/justifications of psychological theories, the conceits of academia, human-being cops, advantages/defects of state-city-county governmental administrations & bureaucracies, harsh realisms of ordinary real life, morgues, urban sub-cultures, human-being shrinks, delicious mundane steak-houses, Delaware's 1970ish Seville, street driving in L.A., and, heckfire,  it's  overall entertaining fodder.

I couldn't do it as well; while fortunately the novels are usually not beyond comprehension.

Because, RAGE keeps my attention, as twisted and complicated as it gets, while nevertheless compulsive fun.

So RAGE is my latest rage, and
others should enjoy it.
