I taught preschool for years and now have a 6 month old.  I have read Chicka Chicka so many times that I can quote it verbatim from the first "A" to the last "Boom".  The thing about this book is how easy it is to make it exciting and fun for the listener. Anyone who teaches knows that reading to kids is almost as much about the acting as it is about the words and the pictures.  This book lends itself so easily to sign language, volume changes (BOOM BOOM!), tempo changes, humor, and body movements...if you're not willing to twist yourself "ally-oop" like "O", you may not grasp its greatness.  If you are, your listeners will be hooked on Chicka
