It's unusual for a playwright to produce his or her best work in late-career, but that's what Albee has done in *Three Tall Women.*  The essence of Albee's genius has long been his ability to get language to do what he wants, rather than being constrained by what language wants to do.  But in *Three Tall Women*, unlike in *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf*, there's something urgent and concrete at stake: what, exactly, was the meaning of a dying woman's ninety-two year life?  It's this question that fuels the gripping conflict between the play's three characters, "A", "B", and "C", who represent a single woman at ages 26, 52, and 92.  

There is so much in *Three Tall Woman* for brilliant actresses to exploit that the play seems virtually certain to be a hot ticket for as long as live theater exists.  It's the kind of play that, if properly cast, could sell out the National Theater of Mars, or a similarly remote venue.
