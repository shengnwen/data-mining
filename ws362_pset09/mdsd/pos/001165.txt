Sometimes, when one has high expectations of an author, one can be dissapointed with the final work.  Not so with Robin Hobb's Ship of Magic.  This is the fourth of Hobb's books that I have read and I am becoming more and more of a fan with each one.  

While the Ship of Magic begins very slowly, the action and intrigue pick up quickly about half way through the book and don't let up an inch the rest of the way.  The characters and storyline are wonderfully compelling and full of emotion.  Believable interactions between characters and the way that Hobb gives a glimpse of their true thoughts gives the story a very realistic feel.  Human misery, hate, joy, and love are described in a way that a reader can almost feel, really bringing the story to life.

I strongly reccommend all of Robin Hobb's books
