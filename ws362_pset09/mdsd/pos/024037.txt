"The EC Archives: Weird Science Volume 1" is a worthwhile purchase for those interested in comic book/illustrated fiction history. Those familiar with EC Comics probably think of Frederic Wertham, congressional hearings, the Comics Code Authority, etceteras unjustly destroying it. I disagree with such judgment and thankfully the book says little about the subject, choosing instead to focus simply on reprinting the stories.

The book wonderfully reproduces the comic book art and stories on thick, glossy pages and the hardback binding is durable. "Weird Science" also includes letters readers sent to the editors of EC Comics as well as some newly written historical commentary.

Perhaps the most fascinating part of "Weird Science" is the story near the end of the collection entitled "The Last War on Earth." The basic plot of this short story is nearly the same as the finale of Alan Moore's "Watchmen." The same or similar ideas can occur in more than one individual, so I certainly wouldn't accuse Moore of plagiarism, of being influenced by, or even being aware of "The Last War on Earth," but I was fascinated to see this story told years before Moore's (overrated) tale. I never knew this story existed and I'm curious if many others are aware of it.

"The EC Archives: Weird Science Volume 1" would be worth the purchase for the general history alone; "The Last War on Earth" makes it even better
