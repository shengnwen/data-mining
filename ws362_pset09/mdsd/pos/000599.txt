I bought this version, because I've wanted to read the Old Testament (chronologically), but just coudn't seem to make it through the first few chapters of Exodus before I (sadly) lost interest.  Now, the Old Testament comes alive for me, and I'm having fun reading the events in a vernacular I can understand. 

That being said, some of our favorite verses in the New Testament, and in fact, I've even noticed a couple in my OT reading, get lost in translation, and the beauty and power of the original text gets watered down.  For example, Romans 8:28+29

NIV:  And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.

CEV:  We know that God is always at work for the good of everyone who loves him. They are the ones God has chosen for his purpose, and he has always known who his chosen ones would be. He had decided to let them become like his own Son, so that his Son would be the first of many children.

Overall, though, I think this is a great Bible for beginners, for those new to the faith, or for people like me who struggle with cubits, thees, thys and thous. :
