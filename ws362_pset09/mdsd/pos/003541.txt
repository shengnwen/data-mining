To start this is NOT a detective story.  This is NOT a standard fiction novel.  This is NOT a nouveau roman in the style of Alain Robbe-Grillet's "The Erasers".  What this is, IS a stylized version of a man's endeavor to encounter himself and survive.  OK, this sounds almost as ambiguous as the book itself.

To my feelings (and IMHO), Auster is trying to look into the 'soul' of a character in a novel and bring him into our own thought processes.  It may just be a way for him to tell us about himself and how he has searched for himself, in a very unorthodox way.  His search is the story itself, and the wanderings of Auster/Quinn is his own anabasis.  His time in the alley and dark room, would then be his exploration of what is the minimum we truly need to survive, and not what we want in the ways of creature comforts.

He tells us what he IS trying to do in the book in his discussion of the Auster character's essay of Cervantes "Don Quixote".  He explicitly states the proposition there are questions as to who is the author of DQ.  Whether Cervantes is really DQ, and the whole story of finding the book in a bookstall and translating it into spanish from arabic is Cervantes way of giving up ownership to see how it will be perceived.  

I don't think that the naming of the wandering character "Daniel Quinn" (DQ) is anything but a direction by Auster to this idea. That DQ uses his name, as Don Quixote represented Cervantes seem straight forward.

The next two volumes should make this clearer as the follow-ups are supposed to do in a trilogy.
