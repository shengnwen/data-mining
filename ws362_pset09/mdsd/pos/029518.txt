This is a great book for those who want to read stories.

Milton Erickson was perhaps one of the best hypnotists in modern times.  And his work should be studed by ANYONE who wants to compeletly understand what is possible with hypnosis in therapy.

Read in conjunction with the works of Richard Bandler and John Grinder, the reader should be able to deepen their understanding of hypnosis in a very useful way.
