Hank Thompson from Huston's sensational debut novel Caught Stealing returns in this even more violent, a little bit more farfetched but very entertaining sequel.  If you have not yet started reading this book and haven't actually read Caught Stealing you should put this novel aside, find a copy of Caught Stealing and read it first as Six bad Things gives away substantial chunks of that novel's plot.  Saying that though because it does give away this information, Six Bad Things can be enjoyed as a stand alone novel however you are missing out on a sensation read with Caught Stealing.

In Six bad Things, Hank is now living a quiet but comfortable existence in an isolated part of coastal Mexico with the cat (Bud) and the four point something million dollars. One day his anonymity is shattered by a Russian backpacker named Mikey who wants to blackmail Hank, the price for his silence, one million dollars!  Hank isn't thrilled but accepts this scenario until Mikey tries to up the stakes by threatening Hank's parents.  Mikey learns that Hank is no longer the pushover he used to be and corrupt Mexican police convince Hank he must flee back to the USA.  So Hank posts the cash to Vegas and sets out for the border on a journey where he will soon learn, everything so far has been a picnic to what he is about to endure!

Six Bad Things isn't as smooth as read as Caught Stealing and to be honest doesn't quite meet the high benchmark of the first novel.  There's a lot more violence in this one as well as high levels of drug use by Hank and others.  Still hooks you to keep turning the pages though. Nothing will stop me checking out the third novel in this gripping series!
