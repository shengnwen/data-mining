Anne Fadiman (b. 1953) is that rare writer - she speaks directly to the mind of the reader. Though we don't know her, she seems to be our best friend. I even think she'd be pleased that I read the 162-page volume the way I'd pick at a delicious tinned fruit cake - savoring each morsel-filled page. Emerging from an eminent literary family - and knowing enough, though happily married - to keep her own name - she recounts childhood days of compulsively proofreading menus and enjoying the art of reading a Toyota manual. An entire chapter is delightfully devoted to the library of former British prime minister Gladstone (1809-98). When "leadership pressed too heavily on him, Gladstone did one of 3 things: felled large trees with an ax; walked around London talking to prostitutes; or arranged books."  Arrange your own bookshelf or nighttable to include this beautiful lime-colored volume, with little Anne sitting atop a pile of books, our next-best teachers on how to live our lives. Her wit and humanity abound
