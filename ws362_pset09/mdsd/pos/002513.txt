The book is well done.  There's no way you could please everyone when attempting to explain the kernel of an OS, but I thought they did an outstanding job.  It makes &quot;grepping&quot; through the source much more pleasant and understandable.  Chapters 1 through 3 present the flow of  processes in Linux and introduce the operation of system calls, wait  queues,etc. The chapter on the file system was very well done, however, the  chapter on memory management left me with more questions than answers...it  needs a little more work.  The book requires a pretty good knowledge of C  and some prior knowledge of OS's in general
