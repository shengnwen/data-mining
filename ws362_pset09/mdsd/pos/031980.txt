Ms. Crimmins has done a huge service for homos and heteros alike. After reading this fun, witty, touching, and ultimately enlightening book, the reader will come away with a newfound appreciation for this latest "immigrant group". Far from being a political tome, Crimmins accomplishes what many have tried and thus far failed. By highlighting the many, and varied, accomplishments of gay men, accomplishments that have ultimately been co-opted by "straight" socieity, the reader is left to question why homosexuals have been unjustly denied the civil liberties afforded "everyone" else. A must read for politicos and pop culture junkies!
