This book is solid.  Shell is obvioulsy not just another Ivy League intellectual pontificating from the safety of the "Ivory Tower".  You can tell that he has spent significant time in the trenches in tough negotiations.  My only gripe is that he didn't go into more detail with some of his examples, or show more of his research. But it is probably just as well since too much detail would have probably bogged it down.  This is always a tough balancing act for authors. What Shell has done is write probably the best single book on negotiations for the popular market.
