This is basically an excellent book.  A lot of very useful stuff.  Unlike the online PHP manual, it is on this technology called a book.  This comes in handy on say a NYC subway train, where you want to brush up on some PHP, or find the solution for something you are working on.  

One major warning though: all the database stuff (about 20-30 percent of the book) depends on the PEAR DB class.  That is a great thing to use as are many of the PEAR classes.  But there is certainly great PHP code that doesn't rely on PEAR DB.

Besides the db stuff the book has great examples with strings, numbers, I/O (files and directories), dates, etc.  And being that I used to be a Reptile Biologist - you got to love that Iguana.  If nothing else, just buy it for the cover
