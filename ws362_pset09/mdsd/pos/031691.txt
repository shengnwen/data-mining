  After hearing that Naomi went to Eastern Kentucky University- where I graduated from with a degree in nursing, I wanted to buy her book.  I was touched at all the obstacles that she had to overcome.  Like being a non-traditional student.  I was a Resident Assistant at a dorm for non-traditional students. I admire her courage  to stand up to the plate and go for her dream.  This courage and drive has been transmitted to Ashley and Wynonna too.  They are all very powerful and inspirational women of faith! 
     I have included her book in my listmania, "Books That Have A Bang!
