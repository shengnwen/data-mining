One of those books I've always meant to read someday, and picked up at a bookstore one day when I had more money than time. I had a choice of two (or three?) abridgements, and picked this one. It got schlepped to the beach and not read, but when a mountain bike accident made sitting still for a long time imperative, I had a good excuse to patiently read Gibbon.

Fine through Chapter 14 - full of great pull quotes and interesting connections - but then he got to Christianity and I absolutely lost interest. I'd like to finish someday ... but I'd like to read through, because I'd hate to miss the gems by fast forwarding ... and there's so much overburden to sift through to find those gems.

Fun fact: Early Christians taught that the state religion of Rome, the civic pantheism of 'we all worship the same gods, whatever we call them and however we worship them' was ... demon worship. Now, there's a two fisted bishop for you! 1, Zeus and all the rest were just demons playing on credulous pagans, and any efficacy a sacrifice might ever have had was due to demonic action. And 2, all your good, civic-minded neighbors doing their civic sacrifice to the gods (they may have stopped believing in) are demon worshippers, clearly to be shunned.
