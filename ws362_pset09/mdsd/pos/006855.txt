This is a rather large biographical sketch of 40 people who were traveling on United flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco on 9/11/2001.  As most people know, four Arab hijackers took control of the aircraft and turned it around aiming it in the direction of Washington D.C.  The hijackers never made it to their intended target because probably 5-6 passengers decided they were going to take the aircraft back.  The hijackers either lost control of the aircraft or plunged it into the ground.  
Almost all the passengers were detailed in this book.  Many of them had made last minute phone calls to their loved ones to say good bye, and these were tear jerking moments to read.  That is why I rated this book a four star.  Most of the other material was rather pedestrian.  
The problem I have with this book is that the author leaves much of the material out about the probable struggle aboard the aircraft.  Perhaps not much is known, but it would have been  interesting knowing the possible scenarios.  What we get is sweet memories from relatives of their lost ones on Flight 93.
This should be known, but the struggle needs to more detailed in the book
