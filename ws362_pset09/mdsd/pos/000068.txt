WWI is massive in scope and often, non-fiction accounts can be a cumbersome read.  Shaara mixes fictional narrative and non-fictional fact to tell the story of WWI in a manner that is engaging, personal and memorable.   By employing real-life characters, we see the motivations that these characters took into the war and, in the epitaph, we learn how their lives (and the course of their nations) were effected in the years after the Armistice.  I believe that this is such a "must-read" that I'm buying copies for 2 of my friends as Xmas gifts.
