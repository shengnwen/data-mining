This book is very well researched and interesting.  It traces the history of American success literature from Ben Franklin up to the time of publication.  There is a lot of interesting material.  The only downside is it reads somewhat typical of books of its time period.  It is a little dry and even though the material is good, the book isn't a page turner.

What makes the book worht reading is that it is comprehensive and it is about the only book on the subject.  If you are at all into today's success books, read this one first for a nice historical perspective
