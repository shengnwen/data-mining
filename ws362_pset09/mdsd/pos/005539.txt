Ages 12 and up.The title "A Step From Heaven" first does not say a lot to you, until you start reading the book. The main charcater Young Ju is a 4 year old korean girl who is about to move to america. With innocent and creative mind Young Ju has, she does not understand the meaning of America. The reader will see Young Ju  growing up,getting in understanding of more things,and slowly learning a new language. You will read everything through her mind, how she compares one thing to another and how she thinks.
 The book is not unrealistic because Young Ju is able too adapt to the American culture, but she is not perfect nor her family life is perfect.

The book is not the easiest book to read after all you have to understand a 4 year old's to a 20 year old's thought process. Every chapter in the book is a little event in her life and the book goes through 4-21 very fast.This book of An Na is a challenging and beautiful book to read
