If you are intrigued about "what really happened at Enron" and "were they evil or just stupid", there is no better source than this. The authors not only manage to track the extensive history through the lives of various characters, they also manage to explain some difficult business concepts lucidly and to maintain a consistent voice of reason (rather than bias - which is as easy when you talk about scum like Farlow or Skilling as this!).
I would rate this book higher than "The den of thieves", "Liar's poker", or "Barbarians at the gates" - each of which is an all time classic in the genre.
It is through gems and authors like this that Fortune continues to be a great magazine. Hope they can do it more often that they already do. 
I wish authors of a similar calibre and diligence can write a book on the Bush Administration and the single-handed destruction of human lives, safety of the planet, and international law. One can find many parallels with Enron about misplaced sense of power, self-worship, arrogance, and basic lack of morals - no wonder some of them were back-slapping buddies. Kenny Boy, indeed! Sadly, this bunch won't be sentenced and no cost can be recovered that people of this world already have paid, some with their lives
