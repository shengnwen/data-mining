Overall this is an excellent version of an audio Bible, but the voice of Jesus is offensive to me - at times He sounds either weak, viscious, or just downright laughable!  Since I've heard His voice, I found this very distracting.  The voices of the disciples and patriarchs aren't what I imagined, and the voices of Satan, the pharisees and the demons all sound alike.  But these are subjective observations.  The undramatized portions are narrated very well.  The music is unobtrusive, if you can hear it at all. (I would have preferred some crescendo in the more dramatic passages and I don't consider it "fully orchestrated" as described.)  On the whole, audio Bibles are great for listening to and help enormously in recalling scripture.  But if you've heard the Lord's voice, or even have a preconceived notion of what it should sound like, I highly recommend that you go to other websites, i.e. biblegateway.com, thebiblesource.com, where you can hear audio samples of the different versions before you purchase one.  Had I done so, I would have bought the same version in undramatized format.
