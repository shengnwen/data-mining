This manual is an authoritative reference which gives clear explanations of the basic throws of Judo. It is not a book for beginners because it has so much detail that it could be confusing. For example, there are multiple versions of each throw shown, some of which are quite different from the basic technique. It helps the reader distinguish between throws that are similar, and distinct variations of each throw.

It is best used as a reference for further study of techniques learned in class. It is not really competition oriented, and is more geared to technicians and those interested in understanding the official position of the Kodokan regarding each technique. Only approved Kodokan techniques are shown, and of course no matwork is included
