Raha's book is pretty good but has some flaws nevertheless. The author seems to be too harsh on non-indie musicians, as if nothing of any worth has ever come from any of them. 
Also, she seems to be trying to write objectively, but her opinions and tastes come through in her writing sometimes. Just as an example, she doesn't seem to be too fond of Bikini Kill's music(maybe that's just my impression but she seems to feel the need to justify their technical flaws, despite the fact that they weren't any worse than many bands in this book, let alone in punk in general, and the fact that technical aptitude is far from being extremely important in punk. There seem to be some omissions as well, among them neglecting to mention how Mia Zapata of the Gits died and how it affected the community. Still, if that's in order to concentrate on her life instead of her death, then omitting the information was a good decision.
Despite all its flaws, the book is very informative and serves as a great testament to some of the amazing punk/indie women of the past and present, who, despite their talents, efforts(in many cases both musical and activist) and influence, constantly get overlooked in most punk/indie chronicles.
