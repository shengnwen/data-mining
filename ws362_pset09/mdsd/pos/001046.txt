There appears to be something about this edition that invites reviewers to disclose their background, so I'll follow suit. My background is as a behavioral health practitioner (i.e., "shrink"). In addition to my clinical practice, I work with leaders of all stripes. Been practicing Aikido for 17 years. No military experience (but certainly have wondered what it would be like).

I find this book very fascinating and re-read it every few years or so. I've recommended it to many clients, both military and non-military. Every client I've given the book to has found it very helpful. The book has much to say about violence/non-violence, men's issues, life in the military, consulting in organizations, and other facets of life. The thing I most appreciate about this book is the author's willingness to disclose so much about his personal experience.

DISCLOSURE: I've never had the priviledge of meeting the author (hope to change that some day), but he graciously agreed to write a foreword to a new interpretation of the Tao Te Ching that I'm writing (The book is scheduled for release in 2007). I'm not writing a favorable review because he wrote a foreword for me ... I asked him to write a foreword because I have so much respect for his work
