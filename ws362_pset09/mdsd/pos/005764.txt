This a light and wonderful read - especially if you have experienced any significant part of the world about which Trillin writes - be it the mysteries, nuances, surprises and joys of being a connected parent - or the  delightful pleasures of real New York City neighborhood living - and, even  if you have missed those things, Trillin wings you lightly along on his  entertaining personal flight - great literature, no - highly enjoyable,  yes
