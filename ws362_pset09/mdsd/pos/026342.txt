Most people think that Stephen King just writes stories about monsters and gore, but if any of them actually read all of his books they would see that his work is so much more.  Different Seasons is a perfect example of this.  It is a book with four novellas in it and each one has it's merits. The first and third are Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption and The Body, both which have been praised not only for the novellas themselves but for the films based on them.  Both of these stories are interesting, compelling and a joy to read.  In these the proof that King is a master story teller is evident.  His ability to write characters that jump off the page is inspiring.  The second story Apt Pupil was a surprise for me, in that I enjoyed it so much. The story is about a young boy Todd, obsessed with the holocaust who blackmails a German man who worked at the camps and illegally hid and came to the US.  The great thing about the book is that you truly can't say who is the actual monster, or for that matter the worse of the two, the man or the boy. Excellent reading! The fourth story The Breathing Method is perhaps the weakest of the 4.  It's pretty straight forward, about old men who have a club and they sit around and tell stories, usually of disturbing or weird nature. Don't get me wrong it has its moments, creepy ones at that but compared to the other 3 stories which are fantastic and hard to follow The Breathing Method is so-so. Overall you should read this book, all of the stories are fast paced and interesting. A must read, even if you're not a fan of horror or King. Give it a try
