Seduced as I am by the highly glossy, supremely compact and wonderfuly illustrated DK Eyewitness Travel Guides, I suppose I am somewhat biased as a reviewer. The combination of succinct text, numerous useful details, spectacular photographs, eyecatching 3-D graphical images, and user-friendly maps make the Eyewitness Travel Guides uniquely useful, distinctive and even collectable. The new Singapore book is no exception to these considerations, so much so, I wish I had it my disposal when I visited there last year, if only for the invaluable details it provides. Now shortly before leaving for Singapore once again, I have recently acquired this book, and it has whetted my appetite, by reminding me of the places, the colors, the smells, the greenery, the heat, and the vibrancy I had already experienced. It has also made it quite clear, exactly how much I missed last time, particularly in terms of wildlife reserves, museums, and galleries. The book contains a brief, but informative overview of the history and multi-cultural nature of this exciting island country. As with other titles in the series, the guide enables the user-traveler to gain maximum benefit from his or her visit, by highlighting THE places to visit, and what to expect from these experiences. If I have any criticisms of this, and indeed with many other Eyewitness Travel Guides, it is a shade small, with tiny text font, and it is a tad too short for my liking. But I guess they have to fit comfortably into your pocket, and, in any case, you cannot have too much of a good thing, otherwise you may just stay at home and gloat over the marvellous pictures
