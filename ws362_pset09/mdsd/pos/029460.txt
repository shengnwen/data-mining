In "Gods and Generals" Jeff Shaara has quite a time explaining the actions of 4 great Civil war officers, Robert E. Lee, Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson, Winfield Scott Hancock, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.  Although the story is loosely based on these characters, Shaara fits many different, interesting, and mostly fictional characters into the book.  The book features real civil war battles such as the battle of Fredricksburg and the battle of Chancellorsville.  
There are many twists and turns in this book and, although not historically accurate at times, it is a great read.  I hope that anyone a little interested in this book and the civil war will read this and come up with there own opinion.
