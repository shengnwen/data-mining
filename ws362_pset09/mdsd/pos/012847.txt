It's a wonderful book - I won't write a review, I just want to point out that I think it was released previously (in Britain?) under the title "The Silent and the Damned". I know two people who tell me they bought this book thinking how very prolific Mr. Wilson has been lately, only to discover they'd already read it. But Wilson is terrific and I love the way his hero Falcon manages to be emotionally layered and macho at the same time. It works as a police procedural too, but a remarkably complex and satisfying one. I'd give it five stars except I loved his earlier, "A Small Death in Lisbon" even more
