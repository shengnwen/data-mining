The two authors have done an excellent job, not only of selecting truly beautiful shells from all over the world and doing an outstanding job with the photographs, they have also written very informative text for those who are new to shell collecting. The types of shells are representative and nicely organized. 

While this may not be the first book you need  to identify your beach shell collection if you are a new comer to shell collection you discover shortly to compare your own sheels to these and realize that in fact your own may compare well.

I especially enjoyed the collages of limpets turned on both sides with the wonderful greens and blue greens of quite ordinary Barbados Limpets.

I would recommend it as say a fifth purchase after some good idenfication compendia and shorter books on just starting the hobby, if you are a beginner
