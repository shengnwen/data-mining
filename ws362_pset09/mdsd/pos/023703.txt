This is a very well written book for the new father to be.  It breaks everything down "Barney Style" so you can understand it.  I liked how it told you what was going on with your child and partner also.  You got just a better understanding of what she is going through.  The side notes in the book also had very helpful bits of knowledge.  Before this I never knew people could store Cord Blood or what it was even used for.  If you are a father to be, I would highly recommend reading this book.  As a first time father this book taught me so much I will carry with me for a long time.  The main point of the book is this "Stay involved" and enjoy this time with your partner you have no idea how special it is.

The only reason I didn't give this book five stars was that it never mentioned it should not be read by men deploying overseas.  If you are in the military deployed over seas DO NOT read this book.  It will only make you miss your family even more and a piece of you will die knowing you are not there sharing the experience with your partner.  Like I said if you are deployed DO NOT get this book, run away from it as fast as the French run from a fight.
