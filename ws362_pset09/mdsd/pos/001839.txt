I have been reading the Heartland books for quite a long time and they have been all good but this book is DEFINITELY my favourite. This book has alot of things going on in it and at the end it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I can't wait to read the next book(Love is a gift) and anyone who is a horse lover will simply adore this book
