H Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain is a man who has been 
"trading, hunting, fighting, and mining" for most of his 55 years. Writing in the first person as Quatermain, Haggard goes on to tell that one of the major reasons that this book is being written is because he needed to spend some time recovering from a leg injury sustained while shooting his (no kidding) 66th lion. Nevertheless he calls himself a timid man.
 
The adventure starts when Quatermain meets Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good. Sir Henry's brother disappeared in Kukuanaland searching for King Solomon's mines. Off go the adventurers along the African Umbopa. They engage in an elephant hunt, nearly die of thirst in the desert, nearly freeze to death on the mountains, and nearly get killed in a massive civil war in Kukuanaland where 20,000 Africans die. After all of this they finally make it to King Solomon's mines which is guarded by pillars... stalagmites created by limestone and water dripping upon the corpses of kings of Kukuanaland. And then the evil old witch (doctor) Gagool seals them in. Don't worry. The story doesn't end there.
 
If you're looking for the character played by Sharon Stone, "there's not a petticoat in the whole history," says Quatermain. If you're looking for the Sean Connery character in "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," he isn't in this book other than by name. If you're looking for a classic adventure, this is the place
