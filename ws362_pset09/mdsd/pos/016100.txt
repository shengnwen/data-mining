In Manhattan Laura's daughter Anna attends the prestigious Metropolitan private school on a scholarship.  However, Laura does not know the other class mothers until they are to work together on an auction.  Most are so pampered they offer nothing to the endeavor, but three want to be the commander in chief giving orders to everyone else especially the scholarship mothers.

On her second spouse Bronwyn seems happy with her wealthy husband and their perfect kids.  Dominique knows her spouse adores her with a passion.  Finally Kim is a successful financial advisor.  The three women fight for supremacy until a disgusted Laura uncovers a threat to the school that the mothers better become a band of sisters if they want to thwart the attempt to shut the place.

The mothers with their common relationship woes involving spouses, children and other relatives in spite of economic and social differences makes CLASS MOTHERS a fine look at Manhattan's elitist schooling.  The tale is intelligent and amusing when it concentrates on the mothers of the students especially the comparisons between Laura, Bronwyn, and Kim.  When the story line spins into a save the school against a conspiracy it loses a bit of its bite.  Still as she did with THE YOGA MAMAS, Katherine Stewart provides a smart look at upper crust education.
