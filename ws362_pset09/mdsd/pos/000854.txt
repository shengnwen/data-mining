Easy reading. The book delivers exactly what it promises: good techniques to develop creative ideas. I was expecting a little bit more of a case study, but the examples helped me understand the concepts and see how they worked. Some information on how the new ideas made it through the company, from the marketing department to the final product, would be a fine addition.
