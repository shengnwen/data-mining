This has to be the best book out there, the pictures alone make it worth having, but there is so much more to this book...almost every book I've tried so far had nothing but drawings (this one has incredible full color pics of your growing baby)...it's full of practical advice even as far as lists of meal ideas, remedies for most common problems like heartburn, right down to an entire chapter on diaper changing, care of the umbilical cord etc. I also liked the way this book focused on how to do the right things during your pregnancy, rather than the way most of the other books focus on everything that may or may not go wrong until you become scared and end up with nightmares! Definately buy this book, you won't be disappointed. And I just have to mention those amazing pictures once more!
