Although there are a few similar books that focus on Sea Kayaking safety; this author's approach is my favorite.  He approaches the subject from the perspective of managing risk rather than "being safe".  In other words, he takes a real world approach to being out on the water where things are rarely "cut-and-dry".  There are plenty of introductory level books, some with useful information for intermediate paddlers willing to look for it.  Lull's work is clearly intended for the paddler who wants to develop their skills and "sea sense".  I recommend this book to any intermediate sea kayaker
