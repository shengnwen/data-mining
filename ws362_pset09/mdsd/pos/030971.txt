A wonderful way to learn the alphabet is using nature to represent each  letter.  Jerry Pallotta has offered yet another text with this format to  add to his previous fifteen Nature Alphabet Books.  This time, Pallotta  marches out different species of butterflies for each letter, from &quot;A  is for Apollo&quot; through &quot;Z is for Zephyr Metalmark.&quot;  The  text on each page invites children to pour over pictures of butterflies  while associating each butterfly with its name.  Readers must look closely  to discover hidden characteristics, hunting , for example, to find the  poodle face on the &quot;Dogface&quot; butterfly's wings.  Realistic,  colorful pictures display each butterfly as if momentarily suspended before  a reader who dares not breath for fear of frightening the creature away.   The older butterfly guru can learn new information about butterflies, where  each lives, and a fact about each-the Magdalene Alphine lives high in the  mountains and has black wings that absorb sunlight and keep it warm.  For  young elementary children, Jerry Pallotta intertwines reading and learning  as he provides pictures and information about butterflies from all parts of  the world while teaching the alphabet
