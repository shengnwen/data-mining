Binding is always a key question for a book publisher. Spiral is useful in recipe books and, occasionally, in software tutorials and art books. Newspaper design, however, is kind of in between. Although I do respect the publisher's decision, I believe the book should have a conventional binding so one can shelve it and read the title on the edge. With spiral I will rate it as a four star. With conventional binding I would rate it a five.

Otherwise, I congratulate Tim Harrower for a terrific handbook. I find his material to be appropriate and tastefully presented and am sure many of my friends working the late nights on their community newspaper will benefit from this, the best newspaper design book.

Oh, and I believe the correct choice was made regarding the paper. This finish provides less glare to the user while also providing excellent reproduction for viewing photos and illustrations.

Further, until I find its equal in magazine design I will probably be asking my staff at LJ's Breaking Free - yes, ljsbreakingfree.com will soon be up and running and will be publishing a print version by Fall 2005 - Bill Anderson.

Incidentally - I have purchased two copies of this expensive book. One for myself and another for my staff to share and learn. Seventy bucks is cheap when one pays staff members by the hour or when one has to stop the presses due to graphics or design errors. I know this from experience.
