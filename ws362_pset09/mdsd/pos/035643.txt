After reading this book, I came away with a better understanding of why Africa is in the precarious situation it is in.  After years of leaders making and breaking promises, the people have had little progress.  This book follows the path of this story, which is told in a clear , readable manner by the author who clearly knows his subject matter.  From independence to the Big Man rule, to glimpses of hope the author explains it all.  Just read the book through if possible, otherwise you could lose track of what you are reading.
