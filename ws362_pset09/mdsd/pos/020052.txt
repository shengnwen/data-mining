Dick Staub's written a "gem" of a book, here, and he tackles life from his own perspective, and along the way, he's given a great deal of thought, and reading, to trying to figure out what the Christian life is supposed to be, and the answers he has come up with are astounding.

He covers topics from relating to unbelievers, to trying to build empathy with others, to building bridges, and the culture war, among other topics.  He has written a deeply moving and compassionate book, and my own feeling is that it was too short.  I'm looking forward to his next book.

This is compelling reading, and thoughtful as well.  He is a reader and a leader!!
