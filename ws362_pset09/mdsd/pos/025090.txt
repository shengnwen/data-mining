A psychiatrist and amateur cellist, I salute Prof. Higgins for clearing the philosphical brush from the field of ethics and writing a sophisticated but clear and humane book for general readers. I learned much about 19th century thoughts and prejudices (Hanslick, especially), about sclerotic narrowing of philosophical categories, and the liberating but also disciplining aspects of music.  Thank you
