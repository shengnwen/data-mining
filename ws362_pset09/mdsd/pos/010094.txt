This is an extremely light read from Rupert Everett.  I've always loved his acting - he does a marvelous job playing droll English aristocrats.  This is more of the same, and even though it doesn't live up to the caliber of his acting, Everett's fans will enjoy it.  Parts of this novel are clearly autobiographical (not all, one hopes), and those are the parts that are the most successful.  Especially adept was his portrayal of the vain neurosis of a semi-young, handsome actor.  All in all, I prefer Stephen Fry's take on the modern English comedy of errors novel, but that only seems fair since I prefer Everett's acting
