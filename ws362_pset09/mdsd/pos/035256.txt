Charles Phoenix has obviously spent countless hours researching this book. The amazing photos and memorabilia gathered here are priceless and worthy of more than a mere cursory examination. Where else could you see this stuff? His text evokes memories of innocent times we'll never see again. I'm giving this book to co-workers, family, and friends as holiday gifts. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't treasure this book - I want everything Charles Phoenix can dish out! More pleeeze
