This book is quite simply superb in every conceiveable respect.  It is written by a scholar who understands and respects Tolkien's own scholarly passion for philology, the science and stories of the evolution of words and language.  This is very different from the humanistic field of literary criticism, and Shippey explains at some length what a philologist can and cannot do.  The close reader will end Shippey's book with a wistful feeling that some very wrong turns have been made in academia over the past one hundred years, and one of the reasons for Tolkien's greatness in his time was quite simply his refusal to accept or acknowledge that these wrong turns had been made.  At bottom, a scholar of literature is, or at least ought to be, someone who loves words.  We will always have a few of these people among us, and Tolkien's and Shippey's works remind us that no overgrown pathway is ever truly lost
