Robert Parker's books are almost always mysteries set in modern day Boston.  This is not a mystery and it is set in 1940's New York.  It has what Parker always does well - strong tough guy main character, shadowy criminals, and good dialogue, but the book is about far more than the good tough guy beating the bad guys - although that does happen in a terrific and clever way.

Burke - this novel's tough guy - is a wounded WWII veteran who returns to find his wife has left him.  He moves from one underworld enforcer type job to another and then to being a bodyguard to a spoiled daughter of a mob boss.  From there he is hired to protect Jackie Robinson.  He is the "nothing left to lose" stoic.

The plot follows Burke protecting Robinson during his first year in the major leagues.  There are lessons to be taught and learned by both while the mob is after both Burke and Robinson.

It is always a slippery slope to incorporate a real person in a piece of fiction.  However, Parker pulls it off well.  There is nothing about Robinson that is unbelievable.  A fictitious character might have been used, but it would not have given the novel the legitimacy that using the real Jackie does.

Interspersed through the book are very brief autobiographical sketches by Parker as a boy, baseball fan, Jackie fan and pubuscent adolescent.  They add another feather in the cap of credibility to the fiction.  The real box scores add more credibility.

There are lessons on love, friendship and race relations.  However, the book never gets preachy or sanctimonious. This is because the characters learn through experience rather than lectures.  This is the true talent and trademark of Parker: the story - and here the lessons - are moved along by action.

Highly recommended
