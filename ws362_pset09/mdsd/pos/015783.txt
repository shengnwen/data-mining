This book is sooooooooo good.  It is like being enrolled in a decorating class --- except you learn and study at your own pace. This is helpful to me since I do not have time to take a class.   I have never seen another decorating book that even compares to this.   She breaks everything down into steps and categories.  Everything is illustrated using actual rooms and real situations.  The information is very usable and I will be applying the principals learned in this book from now on. I think it will save me $$$$ by keeping me from purchasing the wrong accessories that do not work in my home.  The book is also attractive and fun to look at so you could approach it by just looking at it and getting ideas the way most decorating books help us This book will help you learn what works and what does not and why. Again it is the best decorating book ever because you can casual use it to flip through and get ideas.  You can also use if to really study and learn how to decorate.  Either way you will not waste your money on this one.
