After some lovely color photos, John Willis and Ben Hodges delve into Theatre year 2003/2004.  Photos, cast lists, and running dates for hundreds of shows.    Shows are also grouped according to theatre company.  At the end are more photos of Theatre World award recipients, past and present, as well as the longest running shows on Broadway (CATS comes in first, with 7, 485 performances.  yikes.)

A must for any theater fan!
