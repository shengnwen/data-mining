For years I have enjoyed the previous edition as a source of information and reference.  It is a good adjunct to many of the courses in Chemistry to give additional background.  The authors seem to anticipate what you will  need to learn. The inset boxes are excellent in that they call attention to  practical industrial chemistry and I know of no other text that so  successfully stresses applied chemistry while most texts give no insight  into the real world of the practical side of Chemistry. Do you know how a  match is made? Chemistry of the Elements will educate you!  Harry Persinge
