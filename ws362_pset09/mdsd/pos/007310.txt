This is a great book! I am in 3rd grade so I am an angel. This one boy was sad because he was a rat and he wanted to be an angel again! But his friend liked to be a rat and started to be messy! He talked his friend to be messy,mean,and brave. Let me remind you that it is a great book and I hope you like it too
