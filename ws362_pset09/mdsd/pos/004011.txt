Even those who disagree with P.J. O'Rourke's conclusions will usually tell you that his manner of expressing those conclusions is highly entertaining.  O'Rourke's dry wit and bizarely appropriate analogies are absolutely hysterical.  I listened to this book at the gym and had several of those "weird guy laughing at nothing" moments that can make you an outcast in a hurry.

But besides being funny, O'Rourke applies sound fundamentals of economics and history to a very logical dissection of the world around us.  Being written in 1993, some of this book's examples are dated, but the logic used to analyze them is just as instructive today as it was then, and most of today's issues possess close parrallels in O'Rourke's 90s examples.

The book reads lightly, but O'Rourke traveled to Somalia, Haiti, the Amazon, Vietnam and other hot spots in writing this book - he did serious work and has a serious philosophy underlying his humor.  

Give this one a read and see the world the way the politicians would rather we didn't
