Nouwen is at his very best in this classic work. Readers will be captured by the spiritual depths of this book as Nouwen probes the three movements of the spiritual life.  I have taught this in a small group format several times with great response and discussion.  This book ranks in my top five favorites of all time, a book complex enough to provide fresh meaning each time it is read. Highly recommend
