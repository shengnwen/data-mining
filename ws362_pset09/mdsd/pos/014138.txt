Simple? No.
When I was a child I received this book as a gift from my Dad.
I knew I would cherish it always. Even though I was young, I knew there was a deep message there, one I could grasp easily with my child's mind, and more that I knew would be uncovered for me as I grew older and more experienced with the world.
Through countless moves and relocations I held on tightly to this book and even now, as a 32 year old woman living across the country and worlds away from where I began, Hope for the Flowers is still a favorite read of mine. And the messages this book has to deliver? Still coming, even after all these years. Buy this book for yourself, and for someone you love. Write something special for them inside, because they will keep this a lifetime..
