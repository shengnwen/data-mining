Rachel created a saga of facts about what damage we have done with insecticides and herbicides throughout the US without any thought to the environment or ourselves. She showed in this book our many errors in judgement and backs everything up with facts. She also tells about some new ideas(back then they were new)that would fix some of our "bug" problems but not with chemicals that will ultimately hurt people. Too bad it took so long for us to START paying attention to what she wrote so many years ago.
