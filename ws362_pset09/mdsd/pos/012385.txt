I really enjoyed reading this selection of ancient Egyptian writings from the Middle Kingdom.  Parkinson did an excellent job in editing and writing those opening introductions to each section.  I really loved the one on the Maat and the king, though all of them were equally interesting.  It's great to read ancient Egyptian writings. It really gives you a feel for what these people thought was important.  Lots of small tidbits you would never have thought exixted. An excellent book for all to read, a must for the Egyptologist
