Friends,

I suffered from Prostadynia over 10 years ago ( 24 age) and it lasted for two years. The pain was mostly in my right teste and it was very bothersome. I went to a few urologists and they ran the gamet of many different tests on me. In the end, I was told that i had no infection and that it was non-bacterial prostititus. One even told me I had a cyst on the right testicle. Alot of medical talk with no answers. 

Eventually I started to heal my self using exercise, biking, and just relaxation. I made the effort to heal my self through my own ways and experimentation Mind you my pain use to be so bad that I would be in tears sometimes. But i made myself get through it.

This last year, I went through a bunch of bad stuff in my life and the pain came back slightly but enough to bother me. I was so upset and knew i had to relax. However, this time around, my life problems were so different and I felt that I did not have the right tools to deal with my pain. Enter this book.

About a week ago, I picked up this book.  All i have to say is WOW! MAny times while reading it, I shake my head and go "yup" i know that feeling.

It's been about a week now, I have noticed about a 50% cut in my groin pain. The exercises help ALOT and so do the relaxation methods. Breathing, accepting the tension, allowing your body to communicate with you...these are very crucial in getting better.

Look, if your going to drop money on Doctors to keep examining you or are contemplating suregery. Give this book a chance.
I found this book to be very useful and great.

There is hope. Trust me. This book helped me again and if anything is a good read.
