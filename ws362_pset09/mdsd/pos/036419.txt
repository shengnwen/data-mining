I have the previous edition of this book, and it was the only reference (beside some tips from friends on things to do) that we used to find our way around and find cool things to check out while in San Francisco last December. The photos (yes, there's a lot of them) were actually pretty useful, I thought, since they served as a very good guide for what to look for when we hit a particular neighborhood, in terms of landmarks. We found the guide also to be right on in terms of restaurant references and pricing information, and if you want to stretch your trip to San Fran a bit, it also provides useful info for excursions into Napa Valley and the like. All in all, a nice little guide I totally recommend: not your street-by-street atlas, that's granted, but very useful nevertheless
