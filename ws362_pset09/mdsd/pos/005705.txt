One of the oafish ladies in my wife's Big Readers Book Club recently had twins (one boy, one girl) and she could've really used this book before naming the screaming mutants "Cooleena" and "Rupappy".  I suppose that's better than what her equally idiotic husband named their blue heeler ("Muttplug").  Lansky's book really could help a lot of people.  Provided they receive it in time...
