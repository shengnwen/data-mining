Yes, there is alot of sex scenes in this book. There is also alot of character development. I started out from the beginning of this series and if you enjoy adventure, mystery, and romance(sex)then these are the books for you. I thought that in her early books when anita is always rushing from one crisis to another that they often had alot of gore and blood and violence. It is not just the sex in these books that adolescents should not be reading. This series is definitly for adults only
