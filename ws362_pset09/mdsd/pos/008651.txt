And for my money, Dirk Gently definately belongs to it. All right, he fails to rule out the impossible. In this book, that would probably have been the worst thing he could do!

Like several of the other reviwers, I think this book is, in many ways, funnier than the Hitch Hiker's Guide. I only wish Douglas Adams had written more about Dirk. Or Vlad. Or whatever his name is. 

It's a nice, quick read, and though others have complained about how short it is, I think this book comes in a perfect little package. I don't know how Adams could have stretched it out any further, or if it would have been any better for it. Besides, there's always the sequel.
