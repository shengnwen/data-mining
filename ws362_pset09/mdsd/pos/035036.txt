  I'm an avid reader. Hundreds of books have traveled through my brain, some good, some great and a few have been failures. I try to pick books that I believe I'll enjoy and learn something in the process. With this said I must say that "Bye Bye Bertie" is one of the best books I have ever read. Hands down. It should be passed down through the generations as one of the best pieces of Christian literature ever written. It is incredibly clever, laugh-out-loud funny (every sentence of every page is a riot), satire at its finest, interesting characters, whacked-out storyline, but most of all it's a compelling look into the heart of the Christian...our struggles, thoughts, cultural influences and idiosyncrasies. This book is a MUST for every believer. If you're a one-dimensional thinker, trapped in the bonds of the typical mega-church you may find it offensive but if you think on your own and know the Word of God you've love this book. 
  Now for the bad part; it's too short. 168 pages is not enough. And I feel really bad for Rick Dewhurst. How is he ever going to top this...his first book? If you read this Rick, get to work. I'm waiting for your second attempt.
