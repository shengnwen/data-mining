Age of Kali is a fascinating read. I have been to or lived at many places Dalrymple writes about in this book and so I can relate to what he says. 
I must admit that insights that he brings out are much deeper than my own even when I spent years living in those places. The most interesting chapters are that of Vrindavan, Sri Lanka and Hyderabad. The section on Bombay was a bit of a drag, particularly when after having written so brilliantly so far he got stuck with Baba Sehgal and Shobha De (the latter only a few English speaking people know anyway) and missed the pulse of Bombay. 
Both Bihar and Pakistan were equally depressing (not because of Mr Dalrymple), though insightful at the same time. 
This is a great read, cover to cover but appears more of a collection of essays written at different times rather than a fluent continuous travelogue. Imran Khan's story could have been cut short by several pages and the author's journey into Reunion Island, though fascinating in its own right, seems like a chapter from another book. 
There are flashes of brilliance in a wonderfully written piece but also dots of passable text. 
Overall a brilliantly written book about an extremely complex people and difficult times with the elegance of a master story teller and pathos of a native.
