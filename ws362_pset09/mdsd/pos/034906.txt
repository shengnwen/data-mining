David Maister's book "Practice what you Preach" describes the results of a statistical analysis of successful professional service firms. Maister concludes that the successful firms are those that commit to a strategy of teamwork, high standards of quality, and employee development. In summary, employee dedication leads directly to improved financial performance for the firm. 

Besides the statistical arguments, Maister provides case studies of the firms to show how firms implement success on a tactical and micro-level. These case studies seem to demonstrate that the most successful managers are energizers of the workplace, able to encourage standards of excellence and develop excellence in their staff. Profit follows from this position, rather than the other way around. 

The conclusion that integrity, excellence, and participation create a profitable firm seems reasonable and well argued. The question then becomes, why don't all firms appreciate this and enact policies that will energize the company in this way? The last chapter discusses this issue, and for this reason I found it the most interesting.

If the formula for success is so obvious, then why don't more firms enact it? Maister states that what these firms lack is courage, or more specifically the inability to choose long term work focused "on strategy" versus quick, short term profit. This conflict, Maister says, is inevitable. Coming up with good ideas for success is not the hard part - it is failure in execution and follow through of the strategy that dooms those plans. 

The lesson Maister draws is that managers may believe that their greatest value is in creating a vision, and this is false. The greatest value of a leader is in implementing vision.
