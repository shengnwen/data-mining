This is the most balanced account of the relationship between the Indians and the early settlers I have read.  It is an excellent book for someone who is interested in both sides of the story, Indian and Puritan.  Vaughan  tries to portray the truth of both people's viewpoint and doesn't get  bogged down in politically correct rambling so prevalent in modern  renditions (i.e. Greg Nobles). A must read for those who desire to be  balanced in their view of History
