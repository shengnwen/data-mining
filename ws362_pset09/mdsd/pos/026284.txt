I read this book here in Brazil.It is available free on internet.This book has many chapters talking about the money pumped by famous americans, to Hitler's gang.
Good work, but this book didn't showed you openly, that the same banks and companies, who gave money to Hitler, also gave money to Lenin or were big USSR's costumers before.To example, Ford Motor Company gave money to Hitler, but this happened after big business between USSR and Ford Motor Company.In fact, before Hitler took power, in 1933, if didn't gave money to Hitler's gang , you couldn't be a great USSR's costumer.
