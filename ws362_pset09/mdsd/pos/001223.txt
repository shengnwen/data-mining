Frank Peretti's THIS PRESENT DARKNESS transcends the normal realm of 'good verses evil' by blasting headlong into the Angelic Conflict. The reader is taken on a spiritual journey that is a virtual tug of war between Angelic warriors and demonic forces with a tiny American hamlet and its' citizens as the rope. 

Though Peretti does take some liberties with dispensational reality, the book flows nicely and story will keep you flipping pages long past your bedtime. Peretti displays his literary power in enticing the reader to press on with alacrity to see what happens next, only to be propelled further still into the abyss.  There exists as well, much to be said for Peretti's ability to introduce seemingly mundane and miniscule segments of information only to have them later on, blast back into the story with enormity.

Peretti did seem to have some slight lapses in research. Some things just weren't too logical, such as covertly searching real estate company records to determine property ownership when the logical source would have been the County Deed Records that are available to the public without the need for undercover work. However, such discrepancies do little to detract from the overall story.  

This is considered a classic novel of Christian fiction for good reason. This one is worth reading on many levels. The story is far from ordinary, flows nicely and entices the reader on to the very end.
