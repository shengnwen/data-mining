I'd seen the basic "Worst-Case Scenario" and got quite a kick out
of it: Reality-based solutions to highly unlikely -- but within
the realm of possibility -- situations.

When I happened on "The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook:
Dating and Sex", I had to buy it.  The laughs alone should be
worth the price.

And the laughs were indeed worth the price ($14.95).  The chapter
on how to avoid or get rid of excessive gas is a hoot.  (And
P.S., I learned a thing or two between giggles)

(I don't know if the signs of tsunamis were included in that
first issue, but if they were, the authors might have been
responsible for some survivors of that recent devastation around
the Indian Ocean.  I heard today that a twelve year old girl who
had learned about tsunamis in school figured out what was
happening and was responsible for warning and saving 100
tourists.  So that makes these "Worst-Case Scenario" books feel a
little more serious than the "Humor Section" might suggest.)

These books have a wining premise: They appeal to everyone's
paranoia, those fears that occupy the dark recesses of your over-
worried brain, and then give good solid advice to the questions
no one dares to ask.

Here's what this book starts with:

How to Determine Whether Your Date is an Axe Murderer
How to Determine Whether Your Date is Married
How to Determine the Gender of Your Date
How to Determine if Your Date is a Con Artist

Don't you want to be able to answer these questions?  I'll bet
the authors have even thought of a few you haven't imagined yet.
And best of all, they've figured out the solutions so you don't
have to!

If you want some good laughs along with some real, concrete
solutions to your most bizarre dating worries, this is the book
for you.
