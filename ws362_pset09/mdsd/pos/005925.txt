Published in 1995, this 125 page volume is considered a 'delayed King's  Gambit'. Move order for White usually consists of 1.e4 2.Nc3 3.Bc4 4.d3  5.f4 6.Nf3 and 7.O-O Unlike the King's Gambit though, the F pawn is  protected on it's release by the Queen's Bishop since the Queen's Pawn is  previously moved to d3. The King's Rook at some point should have a  half-open F file to manuever on, which does have it's advantages. The  downside to this opening is that it doesn't place pressure on Black's King  Pawn immediately, giving Black more room to breathe so to speak in the very  beginning. White has a choice of quiet strategic lines and violent gambits.  Fun to pull out to surprise your opponent
