If anyone wants to know what living in post-revolution Iran is like for a woman, this is the book.  Great detail is given to how the messages of western literature apply to life in the theocratic totalitarian state. The scariest thing, for me, is how closely the vision of Iran held by muslim extremists conforms to the stated vision of the U.S. held by christian extremists.  This touched me with reality the way The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood touched me with fictional possibility.

I have to say that I felt undereducated where her literary criticisms came in
