My story is about ayoung man who takes a camping trip to the vast candain bush to vist some old  Indian trapper friends . Along the way he picks up a wounded indian wolf dog ,that has seen better day. Senseing that somthing is wrong, Brian quickens  his pace. When he arrives at the camp he finds it abondoned, noticing that his new sompanion is growling at somthing on the ground, cautiously Brian approaches and finds a track of a obivious rouge bear . Following the tracks into the dark forest, he soon finds himself staring into death itself eye`s. Brians hunt is a fine book and I give it 5 stars. I recomednd this book that is old enough to read!!!!
