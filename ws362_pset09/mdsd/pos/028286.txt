Enjoyed this book tremendously, especially since the author herself indicates she is divorced so why should she be considered the expert but I found that I couldn't put the book down.  It was filled with lots of tips,  ideas and referenced other books I could refer to if I wanted further  information.  I finished it in just 3 days.  Easy to read, easy to  reference, lots of tips at sustaining relationships with partners as well  as other family members.  Especially enjoyed the chapter on clearing your  space and her frequent references to other books written by authors.  Good  reference book.  I liked the part of keeping the bedroom, the bedroom!   Good book if you are trying to sustain and build on your relationship
