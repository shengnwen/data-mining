This book was marvelous! All who work in the Medical Field, no matter what their position, should read this book.  It not only tells about the differences in Lori Arviso Alvord's cultures but how they believe and how  medical doctors/surgeons have the ability to keep their patients calm  during emergencies or surgeries.  I think that anyone who is planning on  going into the medical field in the Native American area should definitely  read this book, so that they can get an inside of how the Native American  cultures believe and what to expect.  The language of the book was down to  earth without confusing medical terms and was easy to understand.  All the  stories that were presented brought back memories of my grandmother who  died at the age of 96.  A very good book
