This book is so magical... so wonderful that I couldn't put it down (sorry professors). The book was written so well that I could smell the food every time they were eating... (or maybe it was my Chinese take-out that I was drawn to buy while reading this book).

Excellent Book!  I highly recommend it!  Also the audio book makes it even more real!!
