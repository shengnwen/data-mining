Sitting here is Baghdad, one hears often a simple solution to the counter insurgency problem.  Usually it's some combination of winning hearts and minds and killing terrorists.  The solution may be closer to burying money in the sand.  That idea came from John Maynard Keynes who faced far larger problems than the war in Iraq.  It's been 21 years since I read Keynes' General Theory, eighty years since it was first published.  (My Econ department believed in teaching both major economic choices of the day:  Capitalism and Communism.  So I got some look at both.)  What sold me on Keynes was his General Theory.  What turned me against Marxism were my visits to Eastern Block countries where I could see its effect...on the economy and on humanity.  There is a heart inside Keynes book, the General Theory, the same heart that wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace. Keynes does get blamed for failed economic policies of those Keynesians of the sixties and seventies who believed they could tinker the economy into perfection.  Mistrust developed in Keynes General Theory.  But when I read his book, from start to finish, I came to the conclusion that people just didn't finish the book.  They must have skipped over the second half to believe you could just spend your way to prosperity or reverse bad times with clever monetary policy.  His theory has worked for 80 years.  The book may not be for you, but it is a masterpiece, something to be savored as the seminal work which transformed Classical Economics at a time when the world needed saving, when the alternative, Marxism, which stole the heart of half the globe, but would prove capable only of impoverishing and dehumanizing. The world owes more the Keynes than it acknowledges.  If you love the history of ideas, it's a must read or at least it adds a credibility to your library which a select few can appreciate
