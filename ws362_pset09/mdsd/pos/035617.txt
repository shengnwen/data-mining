If my above mentioned words didn't offer what this book is about I don't know what will.  Cheryl and Webb Garrison have assembled a great book featuring Civil War slang, lingo and material names.  Words such as chinch (bed bug), hardware (weapon), leg case (desertion) pop-skull (whiskey) and yaller dog (coward).  These are just a small few of the many words in this great book on Civil War era language.  This book would be great for reenactors or anyone studying the war and learning more about how people communicated or gobble talked
