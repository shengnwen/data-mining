I really enjoyed this book, it's really a four and a half stars.  I had read some of the other Blossom Culp books first, and enjoyed having Alexander as the narrator, although I think I prefer Blossom.  I loved the setting.  This was a funny, exiting, and somwhat spooky book.  I recommend it to pratically anyone
