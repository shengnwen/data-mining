This is a better story than today's youth will ever realize.  REAL men, REAL heros and REAL Texans are all dead and gone.  You can buy muscles at the local gym but guts can't be faked or flown in on Daddy's jet.  That a true hero's story is preserved and that we can hear his voice and watch his body launguage is a gift.
This movie is as modest as it's hero
