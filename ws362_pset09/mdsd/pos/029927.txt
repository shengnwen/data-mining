This is by far one of the best study Bible's out there.  I really like it.  I also use a Zondervan NASB Study Bible.  I actually think I like this one better, though I haven't switched over yet.  The best part about this Bible is that it sheds light on some of the more difficult passages and also has lots of theological sections that explain how different groups interpret the difficult passages that deal with difficult topics
