The book Memories of Summer is a great book about a young teen girl that has schizophrenia. Lyric and her father have to learn how to control and take care of their delusional family member, which becomes harder and harder for them to do. This book is really good, and it goes deep into the topic of schizophrenia. This book has very strong parts and is powerful at times. Ruth White writes with great passion which makes the book more enjoyable to read. I thought that this book was really informative, but at the same time compelling. Definitely worth 4 stars
