I read an article that cited this book and Fisher extensively.  It piqued my curiosity enough to check it out.  The beginning of the book started off with brain chemistry (not my strong suit), but quickly delved into anthropology and the history of love and its purpose in our biology.  The book was very informative and interesting, though slow to read at times.  It actually helped me understand myself a little bit better.  Not a book I'd recommend for someone who's broken-hearted though.  It might be a little too much to process while thinking about lost love
