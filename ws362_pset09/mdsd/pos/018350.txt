Lora O'Brien does an excellent job of combining an easy to read style, a plethora of practical information, and a very accurate accounting of the rich history of witchcraft in Ireland. 

On the rare occasion when she does incorporate a wiccan element into her practice, she is very clear about the distinction, and does so only to "fill in the gaps" to make her Irish witchcraft tradition more full and well-rounded. What some of my American counterparts may not realize, is that this very specific "borrowing" and making it "Irish" - is very typically *Irish* in itself! I have no doubt that had our Irish ancestors run across some practictioners of Wicca, they would have done the same thing. 

In short, an excellent book, very well researched (anyone who quotes Proinsias MacCana is A-OK in my book), a joy to read, and I plan on heartily recommending it to anyone with an interest in Irish Witchcraft, as well as on my own website, aheartease.com.

I look forward to her next book, too
