"Hardcore Self-Defense" is not your standard self-defense book.  There are no pictures or illustrations, and the book is not really intended to teach techniques.  What "Hardcore Self-defense" does teach is concepts and principles that will help anyone learn to protect himself or herself from a violent attacker.  

"Hardcore Self-defense" also offers numerous tips and ideas for improvised weapons.  When I first read the book I found some things (like belt fighting) which seemed like a pretty good idea, and when I practiced them they worked out OK.  A couple months later I was looking at "Hardcore Self-defense" again and found a couple more ideas that I liked (adapting large steel washers as a thrown distraction weapon; and the idea of hidden body armor beyond that of the `bulletproof vest'), that again after practice worker out quite well.

There is also a very interesting introduction to knife-fighting, where the author points out some of the finer points of using a knife in combat, such as the need for a longer blade (6+ inches, ala James Keating's American Blade Concepts / Riddle of Steel instruction). 

Overall, I found "Hardcore Self-defense" to be a very interesting book with several good ideas for anyone interested in self-defense to consider.
