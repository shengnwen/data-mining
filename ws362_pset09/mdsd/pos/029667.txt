At least as early as his classic novel Childhood's End, Arthur C. Clarke has been imagining what the human race will become when it finally grows up. In The Light of Other Days, humanity is advanced not by evolution, but by the invention of the WormCam, a device that eliminates all personal privacy as well as allowing the whole of human history to be viewed as it actually happened. It's Clarke's imaginings of the truth behind major historical events as well as his character's personal histories that makes this a book worth reading. Much of the other action is less compelling.

The story of the life of Christ is revealed, but the centerpiece of the book occurs when David traces his brother Bobby's DNA backward to witness his family tree (or, rather, his grandmother's tree), leading ultimately to the origins of life on Earth, complete with the requisite startling evolutionary jump we've come to expect from Clarke.
