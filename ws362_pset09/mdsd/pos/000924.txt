Cay Lang is a working visual artist, whose works have been shown internationally, and an accomplished teacher. The book is based on an actual 6-month long class she designed for other students ready to leap.

From the preface: "As my art career unfolded, from showing in nonprofit spaces, to national gallery representation and publication in books and magazines, and eventually to being seen in international museums and galleries, I picked up more pieces of the puzzle. By 1990, I had been teaching photography to university students for some time, and every new batch of students would ask me, 'How can we get our work seen and sold?' The answer was too complex for a ten-minute conversation, or even a semester's length class, so I started the Taking the Leap program, condensing ten years of information picked up in the trenches into an intense six-month practicum."

"The class was designed to be effective. I didn't want to create yet another situation where students dutifully attended a class, took great notes, and then filed them away somewhere for future use. I wanted things actually to happen for the students in a measurable way. I wanted them to experience the thrill of metamorphosis from art student to professional artist within the time line of the class itself, and I wanted to be there to hear them come bouncing in to announce that they just sold their first piece, or got their first show, or won an award. I decided that the class should meet weekly for no less than six months, limited the enrollment to twelve, and interviewed the students ahead of time to determine whether or not they were ready to market their work. The class turned out to be amazingly affirmative, with a high percentage of the artists going on to international art careers."

"This book is designed to recreate as closely as possible the experience of the class."
