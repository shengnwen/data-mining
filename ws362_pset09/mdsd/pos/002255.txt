This book was recommended to me by a resume writer and job coach ([...]). I was floundering trying to "figure out what I should be". Gail recommended several books to read, and I got this out of the library. Well, Iliked it and bought my own copy. It gave me a better understanding of myself and why I am in the career I have chosen. I also understand co-workers and my boss better now too. A good read
