Rise and Fall is a bit dry. It's a workmanlike text book but I enjoyed it. If you're coming to this book expecting romance, high drama and emotion go find another book. The author treats Anne like a politician or a warrior. She shows what steps Anne took and offers a theory as to why she took them and finally, the author shows why Anne fell. You'll probably enjoy Lady in the Tower or The Concubine better but if you collect Anne Boleyn books this is a worthy one for your collection
