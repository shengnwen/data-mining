When contemplating purchasing my first rental, I bought this book as well as The Landlord's Kit by Taylor, Every Landlord's Legal Guide (Nolo), Every Landlord's Tax Deduction Guide (Nolo), and a legal guide specific to my state published by a local legal firm.  The one specific to my state was the most necessesary but "Landlording: A Handy Manual..." was the one that I was able to really sink my teeth into.  There is a lot of narrative belaboring a lot of the author's thinking, which I skimmed, but the book addresses all of the real issues I was going to be dealing with.  I also thought the forms were, for the most part, practical and reasonable.  Can't say the same about the Landlord's Kit by Taylor.  That book was way too gimmicky and the forms were not formal enough for my taste. I would reccommend buying the Tax Deduction Guide by Nolo with Landlording  - I read Landlording cover to cover and still feel I need an education on tax issues, which is where the 5th star went.  For me the Nolo's Legal Guide wasn't too useful because I have a good state-specific guide.  Do buy "Landlording" - none of the other books cover everything this book does and none of the others, including the great state specific law book I got, have the real, human, reasonable approach that really answers your questions like this one does
