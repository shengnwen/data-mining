Eugenides may reserve his talent of epic tales for his second work (also brilliant, in my opinion) but The Virgin Suicides  drips with the beautiful mythological tragedy that my new favorite author manipulates so well.
I have recommended this book (and Eugenides' Middlesex) to every reader I know.  (I've also made the mistake of loaning them out and can't seem to get them back. Presumably because my friends have formed emotional attachments to them. But I digress.) 
While tempted to use the word "poignant," I will add that Eugenides manages to sneak in his sense of irony as well.  Giving the Lisbon family the same name as the famed city of embarkation to America and relief from the European struggle with WWII can be read several ways: as tragically ironic or as a parallel to relief from a horrible struggle with existence.  I suspect that this book is rich with even more such delicious invitations to interpretation than this humble reader has identified.  I challenge any pleasure reader to dislike this book
