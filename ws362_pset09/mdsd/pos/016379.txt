This is an astonishingly beautiful books of color photographs of Guatemalan people (and their animals) amidst their traditional woven textiles. The introduction gives a respectful and knowledgable overview. Vecchiato: &quot;Mayan weaving is a celebration of feelings shared in common by an entire ethnic group.&quot; He provides background and a brief description of the harsh political climate of Mayan Guatemala. The pictures are full of life and joy. Market scenes; babies, children, parents, old folks; processions; plus tender and intimate moments - along with the statement that &quot;they will never reveal themselves completely to any one of us.&quot; This is a wonderful book
