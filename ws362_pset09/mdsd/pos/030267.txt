Carol Spinney is a poet at heart. He personifies the kind, feeling character he brings to life--because he truly is that character. Milligan and Spinney touch our deepest humanity in a book of both lightness and depth. This is a book for you to enjoy and give to those you love. Spinney's sketches are a lovely bonus
