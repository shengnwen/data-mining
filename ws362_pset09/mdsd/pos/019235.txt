Although I was skeptical about this title, I decided to go ahead and buy it. Well, I was not diappointed! I found that the amount of information provided was beyond my wildest dreams. You DO have to do some digging  within the book, but I have used SEVERAL of the ideas and feel that my  meetingas are more focused and on track than ever. Especially when it comes  to technical trainings (which I do!), the book gives a grat deal of info  regarding training issues and how to keep people interested
