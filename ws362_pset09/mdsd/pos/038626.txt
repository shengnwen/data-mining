Even though I am not a professional counselor like the author, I did find the title to be an informative read on human nature.  The book covers basic Christian viewpoints of human nature:  we are fallen and yet are on a search for deep and lasting fulfillment.  

The book is divided into 3 major areas:

1.  A Sufficient Bible - Finding answers in scripture.
2.  Understanding People - A tarnished image and broken relationships.
3.  Growing Toward Maturity - A restored image and healed relationships.

The book covers principles such as:

1.  Different positions on how the Bible addresses problems.
2.  Describing human nature (we are emotional, free to choose, personal, can truly change).
3.  How we and our relationships can be improved (move out of an emphasis on self-protection from pain and become more involved in other people's lives, realize that pain is a normal in life and we should not expend too much energy trying to feel good, and realize that Christ is our sufficiency).

Understanding People is an enjoyable read and is recommended for the professional counselor, minister, or anyone who wants to know more about human nature from a Christian worldview.
