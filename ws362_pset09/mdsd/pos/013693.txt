These diaries and journals are incredible.  To read the words of these children is life changing. Their honest and powerful words present a very different picture of daily life during WWII than anything I have ever read.   Some of the children were in ghettos, some in camps, some in hiding--their  words are pure and honest.  After reading their stories, you will not think  about the Holocaust in the same way you did before
