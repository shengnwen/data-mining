The Saltwater Cowboys are at it again, as they are charged with the rescue of 120 passengers on-board a hi-jacked plane which is forced to land in Kazbekistan. Joining the SEAL team in the covert operation is FBI hostage negotiator Max, agents Jules Cassidy (who merely is window dressing again) and Alyssa Locke, who continues her tortured romance with Lt. Sam Starrett., and Reserve shopper pilot Teri Howe.

This time out, it is crusty Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok who gets the love interest, though he tries numerous times to blow it by setting her up with hunky Lt. Mike Muldoon. Teri Howe is the pursuer, while Stan tries to steer clear of the whole enlisted verses office fraternization rule (which does not apply to reservists). Each step Stan tries to take away from her, she takes two steps forward. It is nice to see the least romantic of the SEALs show his softer side.

This one is fraught with so much tension and a pretty harrowing assault of one of the passengers (as the negotiation team has to sit by and watch and listen in abject horror). Negotiator Max wrestles with his growing feelings for the hostage, who is nearly 20 years his junior, and his inability to save her in time. 

One thing I can do without is the WWII junk. I just skip over that stuff. It does not add anything to the story line other than additional pages. I like when they use an alternate font so that skipping is even easier!

I usually do not like serial books, but this particular series manages to make each book stand on their own merits. You really get to like the characters, and they pop up all over the series, but it is not a forced inclusion like some of the other stories I have read. I look forward to each new installment
