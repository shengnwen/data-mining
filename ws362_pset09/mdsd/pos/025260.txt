I've recently discovered and began to enjoy Nora Roberts' books. 'Private Scandals' kept me entertained, but the identity of the stalker/obsessive fan/murderer was easy to figure out, since I'm HORRIBLE at solving mysteries and my guess turned out to be correct. The book did drag at spots, certain things became repetitive and were more in depth than necessary. The abundance of sex scenes became annoying. I don't think that for normal couples, every little kiss morphs into a ridiculously passionate lovemaking session, but then again, this was in part a romance novel. But these parts were not necessary to the plot and I began skimming over them after a few. Other facets of the book were somewhat far-fetched, but again, it's fiction. Worth reading, but check it out from the library instead of purchasing the book
