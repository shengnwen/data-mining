I am using this book with a young man of 7 years old and he is learning to play the drums the right way - reading music, counting, the whole deal with very little effort or pain. I highly recommend this book as well as the original Realistic Rock book (for older kids and adults). Excellent teaching materials! That being said, I still feel strongly that a drummer needs a good rudimental foundation - so I use the Haskell Harr book in conjunction with this one
