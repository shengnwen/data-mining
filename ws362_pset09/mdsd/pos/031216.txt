During vacation with our daughter in Connecticut I even felt closer to Home of the Big Bird! The first of 7 new books hooked me by the cover picture and title... Even the intimate story of Caroll Spinney: "Playing Big Bird has been my job for half my lifetime. It is a fabulous career- more than I ever hoped for, yet everything I believed it could be. Going to work everyday is a joy. The people I work with are tremendously talented...to educate and inspire young children is extremely motivating." 

"Jim Henson's office held an imposing mahogany table with carved lions for legs as his desk. Over the fireplace hung a majestic papermache`& wire moosehead looking down on us..." Caroll Spinney paints an intimate, friendly picture of gifted and creative genius of Jim Henson: "I pictured making Big Bird a large feathered creature-who is very funny and very silly. Oscar will be a purple Grouch, a furry creature that lives in a pile of litter and trash in the gutter." 

When Bob Hope invited Big Bird and wife, Debra to go to China with his Show, he saw Big Bird for the first time. Pointing at the Bird, "Wow! Look at that!" Big Bird looked at Hope, and said, "I thought I had a funny-looking Beak!" Bob burst into great guffaws of laughter! Big Bird followed-up, "Gosh, I didn't know you'd be so Short!" Hope quickly summed-up his meeting with the Bird, "Let's open-up with those lines, they are funnier than our Stuff!"  

Finishing my second reading of Big Bird, I was deeply moved by his quoting Emily Dickinson, "Hope is the thing with feathers."
Others like, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, "I just can't Dance" and Flip Wilson. As Big Bird learned to dance by pretending, "I can count in-my-head and still dance!"  A delight to both read and discuss with my grown children and grandchildren! Don't miss it!
