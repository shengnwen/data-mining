This is an excellent book, but I don't think it's quite what the publisher thought it was.  The previous reviewer is right in saying that this book does not support Copernicus' heliocentricism in any way.  It is a discussion of motion, not astronomy.  I would agree with the previous review in saying that the publishers probably meant to publish Dialogues Concerning Two Chief World Systems, which does in fact discuss heliocentricism and support Copernicus.  How one manages to publish the wrong book I have no idea.  Did no one read this before they published it?  And how on earth did Stephen Hawking not notice either and write about the wrong book?

Well, it's a good book anyway, just not what they say it is.  I recommend reading it if you want to understand the developments of science (esp. motion and mechanics), but if you want to learn about the Copernican Revolution and Galileo's conflict with the church, then the book you are looking for is Dialogues Concerning Two Chief World Systems.  I would also recomment Galileo's Daughter as an amazing biography of Galileo based around a correspondence between him and his daughter.

Overall grade:  A for the book, F for the publisher's description
