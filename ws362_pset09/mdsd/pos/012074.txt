Dr. Vivian Bearing states at the beginning of the play but she does anyway. Though at the start this may not break your heart by the end of Vivian's journey it does. She is a woman who spent her life studying and teaching Donne's metaphysical poetry now she is the one being taught. She has to learn what the cancer inside of her is doing but most importantly she learns to be afriad and human. At the end of Ms. Edson's moving play the reader is left wishing there was a different end for Vivian. This play is definitely worth the read
