I've never read Smith's classic (other than a few academics, who has?) - but I have read O'Rourke (other than a few academics, who hasn't?).  P.J. does a good job of crafting a readable overview and interpretation of a classic that would probably put most modern readers right to sleep.  The stop-go flow created by alternating wordy Smith quotes and snappy O'Rourke one liners is a bit unnerving in the early sections, but the material is so interesting that you keep reading and eventually take the style for what it is - a witty modern writer trying to boil down an Enlightment era blabber fest into a weekend read.  The only glaring weakness of the book is O'Rourke's personal lilterary curse - his frequent reference to current political news and news-makers.  This instantly handicaps the timelessness of the works - though is does make them glaringly humorous today - probably a reasonable tradeoff to make if you are interested in prehumous book sales.  Those interested in reading this book to gain a basic understanding of economics might consider pairing it with Hazlitt's excellent "Economics in One Lesson"
