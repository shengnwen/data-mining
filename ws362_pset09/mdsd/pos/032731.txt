I read this book when I was still learning how to speak English and I honestly could not put it down. This is one of the books my teacher made us read and was actually my third choice but read it anyway. The book takes you back to Civil War era in a Southern IL farm through the eyes of a nine year old boy, Jethro. He has brothers fighting for the Union Army but one chose to fight for the Confederate so his family was harassed by neighbors and people from other towns. The book is very accurate on historical facts and invites the reader to think and contemplate the views and beliefs of the North and South through the eyes of an innocent child. A reader who do not care to stop and reflect on the feelings and emotions of different characters will obviously find the book boring. But this is the opposite when you know how to appreciate a writer's creativity of bringing the story into your mind. The book also used spellings to closely portray how people in the setting speaks which actually caught my interest as I was still learning American English. Very interesting and entertaining at the same time. A must read for every American child who needs to learn his/her country's history and appreciate that he/she can actually read contrary to slaves in Civil War era who were denied that skill
