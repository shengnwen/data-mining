Though the serious researcher or folklorist won't find much new content here, it's a fun and easy read with a unique format and a wide variety of entries. Most of the entries have associated stories, and some wonderfully unexpected things turn up (yes, Jung's Shadow is identified herein). And for that serious researcher? The bibliography is priceless, and I will probably go bankrupt amassing it. Do not, however, confuse this with an occult volume. This is simply legend and folklore
