Sophie's World is a book about the history of philosophy. It is through the eyes of a fourteen year old girl named Sophie Amundsen, who is the main character of the book. She has had a perfectly normal life until one day she gets a mysterious letter from a complete stranger. He becomes Sophie's philosophy teacher. His name is Alberto Knox. Throughout the book, Alberto writes letters to Sophie. Each day, Sophie has her philosophy course through the letters that he writes to her. Sophie sometimes dozes off into her own world where she only thinks about philosophy and where the world came from. Sophie's deep interest in philosophy and history makes her friendship with her friend, Joanna, fall apart, and also make her mom think that she is on drugs. In my opinion, Sophie is a wonderful, bright girl who has a brilliant mind and a logical way of thinking.
	Part of this book is about the science of philosophy, and another part is the history of philosophy. While I read the science part of the book, it was a review for me, because I had already learned the material in biology. When I read the history of philosophy, it got me really interested. I especially liked when Alberto was talking about the myths that people believed in long ago. There was a myth that I really enjoyed reading. It was about a god named Thor and his hammer. Thor was a god of fertility, and he controlled the weather with his hammer. For instance, if he was swinging his hammer, that meant he was bringing rain on earth. It was interesting to see how people long ago believed how the world worked around them.
	I didn't like how the book had big amounts of science information at once, because those parts were not so interesting to me. It felt like I was reading a science textbook instead of a novel. Other than that, the book is very interesting and exciting. If you don't know anything about philosophy, and you want to learn it in an enjoyable and exciting way, this is the book for you.
