This film is difficult to categorize and even harder to discuss in simple terms.  Author Chion devotes a lot of space in this book to comparing each of Malick's three films to one another.  Hard to tell if Chion is very insightful or just grabbing for straws sometimes.

Of note, Chion wrote this text in French and only later was it translated into English.  It is significant because the same translation issue comes into play watching the film with French subtitles.  Some of the characters' inner-monologues in the film have words and expressions that just aren't directly translatable into other languages.  Chion, being bilingual, has the interesting perspective of experiencing the film in both languages and can make comparisons between the two, noting subtle and not-so-subtle differences in interpretations.

I believe that to get the most out of this book one should have seen the film multiple times.  But if you are thinking of buying this book, chances are you have already seen the film mulitple times anyway.

And for good reason.

Recommended book, though a large percentage of seems to be more about Malick's body of work than this particular film
