I've read numerous accounts of religious cruelty, but it never fails to amaze me how religious zealots will stop at nothing to force their beliefs on others. But what is more amazing is how they will even kill each other over trivialty of doctrine. The extra history concerning the printing press and the evolution of books was a bonus. Now with the internet and the information age at hand it will be more difficult for the church to control the minds and bodies of intelligent people.
