This is just a good old-fashioned action comic which benefits greatly from Jeph Loeb's solid writing. There is dual narration from the perspective of both Superman and Batman. This is a really cool device, as it it gives us some interesting insights into their thoughts on one another. The chemistry between the two is developed well by Loeb. But as I wrote above, this is mostly about the action. And the action is good.

The art is undoubtedly cartoonish, but it fits the story so well that I don't understand why anyone would consider it a negative. This isn't supposed to be gritty or highbrow, and Ed McGuiness' illustrations are perfect for this type of story. 

Overall, this is a great start to the Superman/Batman series. There's just enough substance to satisfy the more serious-minded superhero fan, and a ton of action for those of who who still read comics for the escapist excitement. 

In closing, I must admit I may be a bit bias in favor of this book because my four-year old son loves it so much that he requests I "read" it to him at least four times a week. Of course, I only improvise my "parentally approved" version of the story as I go over it with him. In that regard, this is a pretty good intro for younger ones too.
