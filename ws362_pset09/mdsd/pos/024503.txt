This short simple story of a young Border Collie learning her craft in English sheep country is beautifully illustrated and will win the hearts of any dog lover, particularly one lucky enough to know Border Collies themselves.  When her elderly owner gives her to his son she must make the transition from a town dog with little responsibility to a working country dog. She longs to play with the farmer's children but her job keeps her busy. The artist's wonderful examples of canine body posture and facial expressions speak volumes. Check it out and discover how Floss adjusts to her new life. I think you'll really enjoy it as I did
