This little book is important reading for any one who has or is desiring to write. One of the best things that I could say about the book is that it is full of examples that are juxtaposed. Every element is clearly defined in such a way that any one can easily see the difference between the examples given. This book is a "how to" book for proper use of english in written form. It seemingly covers everything you could imagine from the use of commas and omiting needless words to expressing yourself clearly and not overwriting. The five chapters are: 1. Elementary Rules of Usage 2. Elementary Principles of Composition 3. A Few Matters of Form 4. Words and Expressions Commonly Misused 5. An Approach to Style. 

First written in 1919 and then added to in 1957, it has clearly withstood the test of time. After reading it I could see why. There is not a wasted sentence in the whole book. The 85 pages make it a very quick read.
