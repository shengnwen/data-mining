I first read the Scarlet Pimpernel years ago. The writing style is florid and archaic by modern standards, it takes a bit of patience to get used to, but the Baroness wrote a classic. Using the horrors of the French Revolution as a background, Sir Percy Blakeney is a worthy successor to such dashing heroes as Robin Hood, using his wits, courage and disguises to foil the plots of the evil French Revolutionaries and save the lives of the condemned nobility. Do not expect a balanced view of the actions of the French Revolution, this is a story of adventure, with a dashing hero, and a beautiful heroine. 

Lord and Lady Blakeney move in the inner circles of English society, friends of His Majesty, the Prince of Wales. But by night, Lord Percy, who seems no more than a fashionable fribble, becomes the dashing and resourceful Scarlet Pimpernel, who with his faithful friends, rescues condemned French nobility from the very jaws of death. 

Marguerite, Lady Blakeney, a former French actress who was once naive enough to be tricked into helping condemn a French aristocratic family, is blackmailed into helping the villian, Chauvelin, unmask the Scarlet Pimpernel, unaware that he is none other than her lazy, indifferent husband.  She and Percy have become man and wife in name only since he discovered her part in condemning the aristocrats. He loves her, but he cannot  forgive her for lying to him about her part in such a brutal and pitiless act. All that goes by the wayside when Sir Percy is forced to act to save both his wife, whom he truly loves despite his behavior, and her brother, not to mention his own life, from Chauvelin's trap. 

This is old-fashioned high adventure, and it does seem silly at times, but the relationship between Marguerite and Percy is touching and romantic. A great read for a lazy afternoon that takes you back to a simpler, easier time.
