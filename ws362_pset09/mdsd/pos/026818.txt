There probably isn't too much more to say about this book that the good reviews above don't already say, but I had to chime in in agreement. I picked up a paperback of Vampire High off a Halloween table because of the engaging cover, and bought it because of the clever conceit and a brisk first chapter. And I'm so glad I did - I devoured this book in all of a day and a half, and found myself hungry for more when it was finished.

Quoted VOYA comparisons to Rowling and Snicket on the back cover aren't really fair to the individuality of this book. Yes, it has the clever wit of Snicket, though here it is channeled through a likeable teenage protagonist and isn't overdone. Yes, it immerses us in a school for exceptional students - in this case, of course, vampires - down to the odd yet enthusiastic teachers and administrators, but expectations for Cody are certainly not what they are for Harry and the gang over at Hogwarts. Instead, challenged not with being a "chosen one" but a "meaningless one," Cody chooses to rebel - which in this case means doing his best to make the grade.

What I liked most about this book was how it blended a bit of what's being done with contemporary vampire horror fiction by adult authors the likes of Dan Simmons (namely in Children of the Night) and contemporary YA fiction. I cared equally about Cody's relationships with love interest Ileana and new best friend Justin as I did about the tantalizing hints of vampire social structure in America.

This is a well-conceived and entertaining book that should appeal to both boys and girls, and I for one hope there are more books like it to come from Mr. Rees
