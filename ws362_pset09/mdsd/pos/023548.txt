As a drummer I was needing something like this material. There are many jokes about drummers and one of them is the typical : "Drummers are the best musicians friends". So in some way it used to be true for me, because I was always feeling my lack of knowledge in terms of music theory and all the stuff that you are supposed to know as a musician. So I've found in this book (even though I've just started studying it), despite of the basics, that I already know , that all the others issues inside it are very clear and very easy to understand, as well as the cd that is very useful to clarify every exercise or example in the book. So, in my opinion, this is a great material to take advantage, and I recommend it for those who want to improve their ability to understand music.
