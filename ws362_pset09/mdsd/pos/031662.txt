George Washington was a complex man- and became, even in his own lifetime, an icon.  However, Ellis, author of the book Founding Brothers as well as American Sphinx (about Thomas Jefferson), does an excellent job of helping us understand Washington as a young officer, a Virginia squire, the commanding general of a revolutionary army and finally the first President of the newly formed United States of America.

But Ellis superbly paints Washington's character-- what he was like beneath the surface.   First, he found an  ambitious man with strong self-control. He explores this self-control and the effect it had on Washington and those around him. 

Ellis also describes Washington as a visionary who understood, far better than Jefferson & Hamilton, the future of the young American nation.  Ellis believes that this is one of the most defining things of greatness in Washington- and I would agree.

I have two other books on Washington in my library.  This one is head and shoulders above the others and is one of the better books I have read in the past five years
