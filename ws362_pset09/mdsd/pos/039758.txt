Cornwell takes Uhtred north in volume 3 of the Saxon Tales. Initially, he's looking to get away from King Alfred but plenty of adventure soon follows. 

Not wanting to spoil the fun for other readers, I will refrain from going into plot details. Suffice to say, there's plenty of action but it fails to live up to the drama of being with King Alfred in Volume 2. The battle scenes are solid but do not live up to the epic struggle of the Battle of Ethandun described in "The Pale Horseman." That's no knock, however, since I cannot imagine you could produce that in every book.

What this series really needs is a good map. The maps in this series are just about worthless. Many of the places they travel to are not even on the map! What's the point of including it, then?

I give this one a grade of B+
