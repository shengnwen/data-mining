i just bought this cook book to accompany the quick and easy south beach diet book.  most of the recipes are quick in this book as well, and it gives a nice variety in each category.  if you are hardcore on the diet, or just looking for some healthier alternatives, this cookbook is nice.  we have found that everything we have made so far does not taste like it came from a "diet" cookbook.  do'nt let this fool you into thinking that the recipes for muffins, pancakes, and sausages are going to taste like the real thing.  these are alternatives to the real thing.  we are using wheat flour, oat bran, turkey bacon and sausage and they taste like just that...wheat flour, oat bran, turkey bacon and sausage.  these are meant to be a healthier alternative, not an exact replica of what's bad for us to eat!  as long as you keep this in mind, this cookbook is great.  the main entrees are much better than the breakfasts because there are less "replacement" ingrediets.
