I checked this book out from my Library, and have to say I was very pleased with the contents.  Nothing mind-blowing here, but reinforces (and reminds) of basics.  Provides great examples of situations and how to be consistent with follow through, which I sometimes have an issue with.  Really usable.  I put it on my wishlist so I could easily reference for all the upcoming issues with the kids
