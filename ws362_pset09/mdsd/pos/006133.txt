Define "Normal" is a book about a girl name Antonia who goes to peer counseling and ends up with a girl who is totally different from herself.  Antonia's mother gets very sick, Antonia and her brothers end up in a foster home but they eventually go back home with there mother.  My favorite part of this book was when Antonia's mother comes home from the hospital, Antonia and her brothers then get to go home with thier mother.  I recommend this book because it could help you if you had a similar problem.  It shows that you should not judge people by how they look but you should get to know them first.  Also, if you have a problem it could help you if you talk about it.  It shows you about how if you just give things time, it will be alright
