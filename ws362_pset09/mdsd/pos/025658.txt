This book was fairly good. Muna is a boy whos mother just past away. Because Muna's mother past away, he decides to search for his father whom Muna knows a little of. Muna learned from his mother that his father was a samurai and had a chrysanthemun tattoo on his shoulder. After his mother's burial, Muna leaves on his adventure. I think this book was fairly good because it had a great storyline. The end was the most terrific part because no one would have saw it coming
