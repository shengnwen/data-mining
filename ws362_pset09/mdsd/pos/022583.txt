I have to be honest. I am a comic book geek. When you're raising two kids (and one of them a two year-old) you just don't have the time to dive into a novel like you used to. That said, I've always been a Batman fan. He's arguably, the single greatest comic book hero and has been subject to some of the best comic book stories ever written.

In one of the most talked about comic stories of the Decade so far, Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee's epic story arc, "Hush," introduces a new and very menacing villain into the Batman villains pantheon. In this case, expectations were met for the most part. "Hush" is a thrilling, fast moving story and a perfect showcase for Jim Lee and Scott William's fantastic art. It echoes in certain ways to some of Loeb's earlier Batman scriptwork for The Long Halloween and Dark Victory, being the penchant for bringing in most of the rogues gallery (but when you have what is arguably the greatest selection of villains in all of comics, well, the temptation to bring most of them out is overwhelming) into the story.

If any problems are with Hush it's with the story. SPOILER ALERT. I had no problem with Tommy Elliot being "Hush," the problem is that you never glimpse his inner menace. Instead (that is, when the bandages are off) the audience should get a look into his darkness. But then again, maybe that's what Loeb and Lee intended. 

Anyway, my gripes are minor. I've read "Hush," more times than I care to count. And isn't that the real test of a good story well told? 

And if I could, my review should be four and a half stars.
