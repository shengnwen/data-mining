De Tocqueville's observations of America in the early 19th century remain surprisingly relevant to America in the 21st century.  As some reviewers have pointed out, his predictions are uncannily accurate.  However it is De Tocqueville's understanding of what America is - and isn't - was what struck me most powerfully.  Essentially De Tocqueville wanted to find out what made America "tick" and present an arguement as to why our democracy would not work in Europe.  (The author was a nobleman, mind you.)  His observations remain true to who Americans are, and serve as a reminder of who we hope to be.  

Among the uniquely "American" features De Tocqueville writes about are our society without rigid class lines - that each citizen understood himself to be the equal of all others; the nobility of work (or rather that work - and working hard - was not only expected, but looked forward to); the informality of address (and of dress).  The sense of social and economic opportunity that America provides through these attitudes, and the vast space and immense resources the country has that enables Americans to literally make (or re-make) themselves.  And perhaps most importantly, the seriousness with which Americans took their rights - most notable among them, the right to vote and run for public office.

There are, of course, specific instances that remind the reader that these observations are over 150 years old - the carriage driver who nearly comes to blows with a German duke, or the graphic telling of the volumes of tobacco juice spraying passengers on a sternwheeler come to mind.  However it was refreshing to see that what it is to be "American" essentially has not changed since Jackson was President
