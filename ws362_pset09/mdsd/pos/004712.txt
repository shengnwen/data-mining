As someone else posted, IT'S A JOURNAL!!!!!  Do you normaly go out and purchase a journal that someone else has written in.  The whole point of this book was to get the customer to experiment in the kitchen and create their own recipes.  Maybe watch his show on TV and jot down some of his hints and tips.

Does anyone bother to read the book description before purchasing.  It clearly states "viewers--now have the perfect place to jot down their favorite tips and quips-as well as their own food notes."  Nowhere in that description does it say that Mr. Brown has written all his pearls of wisdom for the reader to use.  How hard is that to understand???  I think this is a great cook's journal and a wonderful addition to any serious chef's kitchen
