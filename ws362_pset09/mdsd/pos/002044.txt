My previous favorite trashy movie guide "Cult Flicks and Trash Pics" by the Videohound (see listing elsewhere) has just been superseded by Wilson's Razzie guide.  Written in tongue-in-cheek fashion and filled with lots of juicy tidbits about each film it discusses, this is a great read.  The originator of the Raspberry Awards IRazzies) given to the worst movies of the year, at around the same time as the Oscars, got his start in 1980.  Although not all Razzie Award nominees are covered here, for that matter not even all the winners are represented, Wilson does a great job with the ones he does cover.

He even goes back into Razzie pre-history, digging up such wonderful gems as 1977's mondo horror joke "The Car", and several exploitation films from the drive-in scene of the 1950's, "Glen or Glenda?",  High School Confidential", etc.  And Ed Wood, that maven of bad movies is represented here on more than one occasion (although "Plan 9 From Outer Space" is missing...too easy a target?)

There are even a couple of Oscar winners that get the Razzie treatment.  Ubiquitous Easter movie, "The Ten Commandments" is torched, and deservedly so.  Not because of it's message, its just that some of the character actors and actresses in that movie are just plain ridiculous.  (Why does Edward G. robinson play every character the same way in every movie?)

To my shame, I saw some of these movies when they first came out, originally thinking they were great movies, but to my credit I was young and naive.  I have seen "Xanadu" and "The Jazz Singer" in recent years and wondered "What the heck was I thinking?"  I intend to see more than a few of the movies in this book now just for the laughs.


All-in-all a very good read.  Besides any book that manages to mention the greatest drive-in movie critic of all time, Joe Bob Briggs, deserves a look.  Anybody with that kind of taste gets my vote
