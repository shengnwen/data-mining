The book was informative laid out well with great ideas.  The problem is the use of black and white photos for the before pictures and color for the after.  I found it distracting and a less than credible way to have her makeovers look impressive.  It is my opinion that before and after pictures should be the same...either black and white or color not mixed.  With that said I do not believe home decorating is a black and white photo situation
