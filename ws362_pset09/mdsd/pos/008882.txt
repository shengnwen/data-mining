I find  Thomas O'Loughlin's handling of the material refreshing. I practice Celtic Orthodoxy everyday in my own life as a deacon serving in the Celtic Orthodox Christian Church (an Eastern Orthodox old calendarist jurisdiction using translations of the Stowe Missal and other liturgical materials). Because I practice it, the theology of the old Celtic Church has become a part of my living tradition and my heart's expression of love and worship of God. O'Loughlin understands our Christian heritage  intellectually and I recommend it to be a part of anyone who wants a deeper understanding of the Orthodox Christian faith from a Celtic perspective. Of the other authors (who have commercially published on this topic), I could only recommend Ian Bradley. The fad of Celtomania seems to have begun because for the longest time academia largely ignored the heritage of the Irish, the Scots and the Welsh and placed emphasis on Anglo-Saxon in the English-speaking world. Then along comes various ethnic studies limited to minorities. Celtomania became the place for any crackpot theory. Now Celtic studies are finally becoming serious. We can do without the immature romanticism of New Age, the neopagans and the various anachronisms we have had to endure about our Celtic heritage. We can lose the scholars who contend that there was no Celtic Church. We can lay to rest the notions of Pelagianism as &quot;Celtic Theology&quot; without giving into the notions of Augustine's predestination. Serious scholars need to read O'Loughlin's book
