I felt like writing a review because it's been probably 2 years since I read this book and I still think about it from time to time (and somehow keep reccommending it to my friends).  Aside from its dystopic classification, this book is a study in dichotomy.  The depravity of some of the characters in a pristine community. How disconnected it seems from real life and any semblance of morality.  How sometimes the crisp, white pages of my book seemed to be covered with a greasy film.  I originally read this book because I was looking for something different, something that didn't have a happy ending.  I got what I asked for--I had to put it down several times because it made me uncomfortable to read.  But I always picked it up again, I couldn't stop.  I hated the characters, but I had to see what happened to them.  Ballards writing is uncensored, unemotional and sterile, but full of beauty at the same time.  The way his prose seems so disconnected (purposefully, I might add) from the events of the plot, the way he mixes the clean and sharp with the oily and jagged nature of things is unsettling but somehow you keep turning the pages.

The novel is not very long and I finished it quickly, I found out what happened to the character's I despised.  The ending was not what I expected and left me unsettled.  I still don't think I've reconciled what happened in the book, but not because it was badlly written, it is because it was so well written, so complex, and challenged my morality so thoroughly (but I assure you, my morality remains intact).

If you are looking for a feel good story or a light read--stay as far away from j.g. ballard as you can get.  But if you are looking for a truly interesting experience, pick up a ballard novel.  I'm not sure I'm ready for my next one yet, but I have one working its way to the top of my stack of books to read
