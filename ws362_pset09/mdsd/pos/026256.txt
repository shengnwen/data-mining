There's an old saying that predicting the future is difficult, but being right is hard. This book is an attempt to predict one future. It's an excellent read, a combination of fictional senarios with observed data. It's the conclusion he comes to that is rather hard to swallow. 

The sub-title of the book says: 'Why China Wants War with the United States.' I'm afraid that I don't believe this. Sure, China has some foreign poilicy ambitions. They is going to be friction between the US and China. But a full fledged war, I think unlikely. 

The first senario, for instance, is what would be the real result of China's attempt to take over Taiwan by military force. Would the US really go to a major war over Taiwan? What if the Taiwanese government decides that they want to join China, there is already a movement in Taiwan to do that? 

One of the things he forsees is an 'unholy alliance between Communist China and radical Islam. This I kind of doubt also. Under the  Cultural Revolution under the pretext of unification of national education, Islamic schools were closed and their students transferred to other schools which taught only Marxism and Maoism. Other outrages included the closing of over 29,000 mosques, the widespread torture of imams, and executions of over 360,000 Muslims. I don't see the radical Islamic people quite so easy to forgive and forget and to enter an alliance.  

Very interesting reading, but a big time war, I don't think so. I hope we are smart enough to not get involved with a land war in China. And they don't have the blue water navy capable of doing much to us
