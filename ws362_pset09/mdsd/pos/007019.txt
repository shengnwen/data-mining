I picked up this book about a month ago, and have already gotten use out of it in the short time since. Many of the reading tests are an excellent fit for students with serious reading difficulties. However, I'm not sure if these tests came about as a result of research or not. As readers may know, if a test or intervention is not scientifically based then it's not viable under the auspices of the Response to Intervention model which means I'm not sure how much application this book will have in the future. It would be great if he'd write an update and include some new materials; although, this book contains many items which are helpful when working with lower functioning students.
