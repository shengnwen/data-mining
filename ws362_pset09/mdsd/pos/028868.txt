This book is a must have book for all pet owners.  I have owned pets all my life and could not believe the things I learned from this book.  There were many things in this book our vet never discussed with me.  I use alternative medicine for myself and my family but never knew I could for our family dog.  Dr. Messonnier provided traditional treatments along with alternative treatments in a very easy to use book.  He provided valuable inforamtion on pet foods and the pets diet that our vet never discussed.  I would recommend this book to every pet owner
