I have lived all my life in Maine and I'm ashamed to admit my ignorance about the Maine Indians. This book was a pleasure to read and very comprehensive. Neil Roldes does a wonderful job at untangling the web of politics and controversies in their history that I think would have otherwise bored me to tears. I'd recommend this book to all Mainers, as well as anyone interested in Native American history or understanding the the Maine Indian Lands Claims Settlement Act.
