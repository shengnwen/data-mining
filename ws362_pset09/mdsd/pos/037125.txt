This is the second in '911 Newpointe' series and also the second book I have read by Terri Blackstock. I was a fan after reading the first book in the series but this just confirmed it. I love the suspense and intrigue she puts into her stories. All the ingredients that make up a good suspense/mystery novel are here. The story also shows the importance of friends and of their trust in you. In addition, it portrays the faithfulness and total reliability of God when people can be cold and accusing.  A brilliant book
