Just finished reading this book and found it interesting. There's no question Maj. Winters was a leader, but the author left me puzzled. I'm inclined to think Winters and Sobel must have had something personal between them to cause such lasting animosity. Also interesting was the fact that Winters seemed to criticize anyone with authority above him, even into his later life, working at different jobs and then with the filming of "Band of Brothers", he just never seemed to be satisfied with higher authority. (He even criticizes Gen Taylor for taking leave...) He gives the impression that only his decisions were the right ones. I think he liked Nixon, because Nixon would do almost anything Winters suggested. Don't get me wrong now, I'm convinced Maj. Winters was a hero. I'm just puzzled, that's all
