To me this book was a mixed bag. Air Frame is about a woman (Casey Singleton) who is sent to investigate a near crash of an air plane for the company that she works for. The thing about that is the fact that the way the plane crashed made no sense. When the crew looks at the nearly destroyed plane, they're suprised to see that no evidence points to why the plane crashed why it did. Add that with the fact that the flight crew was acting very weird and the media is getting all over it and it turns out being a very good book, but this book wasnt perfect. There are a few points that werent very entertaining to read, but it never takes too long for something to happen and pick up the suspense of the book. For me, what turned out to be what i thought was a boring read at first, in the end turned out to be a very good book
