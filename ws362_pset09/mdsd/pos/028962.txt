This book was not quite what I expected, and I am so thankful for that. Most books I've read in this vein are usually overly emotional and sappy, protraying the key subject as some over the top saint that is just too good to be true. Not true with this book. 

Author James McBride has written a well-rounded memoir of his mother, one that can be truly appreciated. He presents his mother as a woman of courage and conviction, yet also with her fair share of flaws. He made her a real person and some one interesting to know. This is not a woman who achieved greatness in the eyes of the world, just in the eyes of her family. And I feel fortunate to have "met" Ruth McBride Jordan.

There are no shining, she did everything perfect examples here. In fact, at times I found myself feeling frustrated at this woman. However, one cannot deny the strong bond of love between her and her children and the triumph of that love over the years. And that is where the true power of this book lies. This woman's story might not be the first, or the most significant, but the feelings of a son for his mother are real and genuine and tender and to share in that is indeed something very special.
