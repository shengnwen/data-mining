Do you know the first rule of writing a novel that'll scare the bejesus out of anybody who reads it? Have fun! Okay, maybe that's not an "official" rule, but it's great when an author does it. BLOODY MARY is an excellent example. 

I've lived in China since 1999, so I'm completely out of touch with any urban myths in the US. But TW Miller has taken one, and created the best story that could possibly be built around it. It'll give you goose bumps. 

"Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary." You stare into a mirror and call her name. "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary." The room is dark, because that's the only way she can come out. "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary." Your reflection begins to distort. "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary." You begin to hear noises. Are they coming from the mirror or from your friends behind you? "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary." Now you see the image of a withered old crone, Mary Tudor. You want to stop, but you can't. She's in control. "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary." Hands reach out from the mirror and toward your throat... 

But, this isn't just a horror story. It's also about four kids who you will recognize. You may have even been one of them. They're up against some seriously evil people, though, who I hope you've never faced. But maybe you have, if you've dared to chant Bloody Mary's name into a mirror in the dark. Please, don't do it again, okay? If you survived the first time... 

TW Miller also has a gift for visualizing everything that happens in his novels, and for bringing it all to life. He also has a subtle wit that will catch you when you least expect it, and a way with words that is simply a pleasure to behold. 

In short, I love everything about this book. Get it! You'll never look at a mirror in the dark again.
