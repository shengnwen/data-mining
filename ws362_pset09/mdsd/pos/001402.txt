This is a fine story for middle readers, readers of fantasy, those who like family stories... Janet Taylor Lisle's latest story blends fantasy and reality in this story of coping with death and loss.  The characters are wonderfully crafted; Ms. Lisle's use of language is superb, and the story  moves along quickly.  Readers hardly notice the movement from reality to  fantasy and back, as the story  progresses from two little girls mourning  their mother and missing their father to a story of girls who have a  mission...finding the &quot;lost flower children&quot;...to the little  girls who accomplish this mission, getting to know their &quot;Great Aunt  Minty&quot; along the way.  The surprise at  the end fits, and the reader  says, &quot;I should have guessed&quot; and then...&quot;maybe I'm not  really so sure&quot;..
