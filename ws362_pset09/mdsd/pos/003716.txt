I think that a lot of reviewers missed the boat on thisbook. So many focused more on Lucy's knack for entering into lousyrelationships than on the real meaning of the stories in this collection: that after years of making bad choices, she is finally coming into her own and accepting herself as a single woman. Believe me, in a society where you are considered a freak if you're a single woman over age 30, that's no mean feat and Houston really understands this. Yes, Lucy feels sorry for herself. Yes, she dates jerks again and again. Well, guess what? So do we all at some point, but one has to go through this in order to learn all the necessary lessons and eventually find the right person. I think the character of Lucy is a very realistic portrayal of a person searching for love, finding what she thinks is love, and being disappointed. I love the advice that Lucy's friend Ellie gives her about men (paraphrased): &quot;Find a place where the ground feels like goodness under your feet, snap the right picture, and a man will walk into it.&quot; The best part about this is that at the end of the book, Lucy realizes that SHE can be the one walking into the picture. Having been through similar experiences myself in my thirties, this was a very uplifting and satisfying conclusion.  I recommend this book to anyone, but understand that if you've never been in Lucy's shoes it may not resonate for you as it did for me and for the other reviewers who've been there
