I have been waiting for years to have this superb book to be transferred to CD.  There is no difference between this and the cd version they are exact except maybe a better sound quality.  

As for the book much has been said about it.  I would say if you are interested in student teacher relations, history of budo this is your book.  This is NOT or NEVER was intended to be a book about Kyudo but more a book on the authors first hand experience of training in Japan before WWII.  One of the best books you can find on the subject.

Ralph Blum is one of the best narrators and makes this even more of a classic by his rich full voice
