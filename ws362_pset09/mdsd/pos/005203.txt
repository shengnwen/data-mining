I was so enthralled with this story in 1957 when my 2nd grade teacher read it to me, that I read it to my children when they were small.  My 26 year-old son asked me recently to remind him about that wonderful adventure story I had read to him as a child.  He said that, of all the reading we had done, this story was the most memorable.  This copy is for him so he can fly to Basidium and rescue the Mushroom planet all over again
