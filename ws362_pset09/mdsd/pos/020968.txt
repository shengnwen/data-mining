John Ortberg, in my opinion is a master at taking the obvious and turning it in such a way that it becomes real. He has taken areas in our lives that we sometimes don't wish to talk about and brought them out in the open.  You will not be disappointed in this book if you have read any of his other books.  I have read several and each one is just as good as the others.  His style is easy to read and yet insightful.  John, write more books... you're doing great.
