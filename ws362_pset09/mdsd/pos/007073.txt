I'm not going to write a lengthy essay of praise; others have done that quite adequately. I'm simply going to say that this book is one of the very finest non-fictions I've ever read. By the time I finished it (about 2 hours ago) I was in tears, & I've been melancholy ever since.

If you have never read it, do so. There's no higher praise I can offer
