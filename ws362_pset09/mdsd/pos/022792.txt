Took this book on our trip and found it to be very helpful. Loved reading the history or background, gives you a better understanding of how and why before you visit the sites.  Restaurant recommendations were spot on.  If I had to change anything, I would be more specific on location of restaurants. Instead of saying go towards ocean and turn; street names would be beneficial as a lot of the streets cross in different directions. Otherwise, a great book to have for your trip
