This is a novel that challenges and rewards in equal measure, a saga of Cleveland, a panoply of engaging characters who grapple with the twists of fate in the city and its defining crooked river, The Cuyahoga. How Winegardner weaves his story is impressive, bringing together mobsters and politicians and journalists, and how he makes us care about their fate and Cleveland's in their wake is the magic of grand storytelling. Any attempt at a faithful summary would require more space than I think is justified in giving my opinion here. Others have done well enough.
 
 Winegardner has a great ear for speech. His dialogue is spot-on. He also has a fine sense of what drives people's deepest ambitions. His characters are large and complex. And he obviously loves baseball, America's first sport of choice (which has yielded to football).
 
 I'm currently in the early stages of reading THE VERACRUZ BLUES, his &quot;baseball novel&quot; that's far more than that, akin to Malamud's THE NATURAL in literary strength. He's hooked me again.
 
 Now I understand Winegardner's selection to pen the sequel to Puzo's THE GODFATHER. He will write a worthy book, most likely far better than the original. I can't wait. I've never read Puzo's book, but I will as preparation, call it a warm-up, for the sequel.
 
 This writer is good and here to stay
