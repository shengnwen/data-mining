As a professional counselor, I was interested in specific ideas on helping parents & children of divorce.  This book had some very concrete ideas.  It is aimed at parents, written in 'plain-speak'.  There's nothing new or eath-shaking here, but it is a pretty all-inclusive little book for parents interested in helping their children deal with the issue of divorce.
