I've been swamped with homework in general, and have been behind in many classes.  So, often times I won't have the foundations to understand the current concept my calc teacher is explaining in class.  However, with this calc book, the explanations are so clear, and the in-text examples and practice problems so plentiful, that I can truly say I'm confident in my calculus skills, even without any teacher instruction.

Which isn't to say you should [AP] advanced procrastinate like I'm doing right now.  But..

It's really a superb book, and possibly my favorite HS/technically college-prep textbook ever.

The only downside, though, is the online supplementary material doesn't seem to work for me no matter what I do.  Maybe it needs teacher intervention for things to show up?  It seems like it'd be a great source of extra problems, but all I can seem to find are flash videos for a couple sections a chapter.  Oh well.

But again, this text really makes me happy.  Get it, it's def worth your time, and a spot on your bookshelf
