Sign of the Beaver Review


I'd give this book 5 stars because it wasn't too hard or too easy.
This book was about a boy named Matt who's dad leaves him in the woods where encounters an Indian boy who teaches him to hunt, make snares, and to survive. Will Matt survive? Will Matt's parents ever come back? Will Matt join the beaver tribe? Find out if you read this book!
