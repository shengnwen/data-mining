Designers, don't let the title scare you.  This is not a dumbed-down guide for amateurs.  Yes, it's a great resource for amateurs and they will understand it, but it's also a wonderful guide for professional designers who need to review professional-level typography.  It's a must-have reference in my library.  Includes lots of ideas on layout, fonts you can use in different situations, fonts that complement each other, increasing legibility and special typographic effects
