I was lucky enough to meet Will Eisner this summer and get my copy of A Contract With God autographed.  It is one of the most amazing pieces of comic art I have ever read.  His characters are amazingly real, the stories are everyday tales of life you can relate to.  Even though the stories take place almost 70 years ago, they retain a timelessness that is unusual in today's pop culture
