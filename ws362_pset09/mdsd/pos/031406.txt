We have enjoyed  this book for several years. My second grader and my fourth grader have both memorized at least 1/3 of the poems.  They have both taken up writing poetry now because they realized it can be so much  fun.  This book is a must have for any young family.  The only reason I did  not give it a complete 5 stars was that, while cute, the illustrations are  not spectacular
