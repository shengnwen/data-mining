We recently had our first granddaughter and this is one of the book sets we want to provide her to read.  Even though she is only 6 1/2 months old, what a great gift!  My parents bought my first daughter the set in the 1970's when the series with Melissa Gilbert was on tv in first run.  She was just learning to read and we would read the books together!  She still has the books today!

I even remember reading some of them from the school library in the 1960's!  They are TIMELESS!   

In a day where many children see so much violence and moral YUK all around - these books will be invaluable in instilling values to children.  

By the way - if you are ever in the South West Missouri area - coming though the state on I-44, you might want to detour to Mansfield, Missouri, not far off of Hwy 65 near Branson, MO, to tour the home that Almonzo and Laura built and lived out their married lives in. It was this home in which she wrote the books! It's a musuem now and a great place to spend some time.  We will take our granddaughter there when she is old enough to want to go see where Laura lived.  You can get information on it from the Mansfield, MO Chamber of Commerce. 

I totally recommend these charming books!!
