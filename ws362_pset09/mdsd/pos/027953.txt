Let me start first by saying I love this series.  If it were possible I'd say I probably know it better than the authors, but as a writer myself I know there is little chance of that.  The characters are alive, and the message is powerful.  Though Glorious Appearing is my actual favorite book in the series (after all Jesus comes back in that one), this book stands tall at number two, and if for no other reason because of the Character Chloe Steele Williams.  Her testimony during her incarceration had me praising the Lord.  I am especially fond of when she sings in her cell with Caleb the angel.  But the best part is when she gives her final testimony before she is executed.  When Caleb kills Jock, it is sweet justice served, and when Chloe is killed (though she walks unescorted to her death) it was time to sing Victory in Jesus.  Though Chloe is just a fictional character I often wonder if I would have such courage.  It should be a question every Christian should ask themselves.  This is an extraordinary book.  Read it
