I have read several diet/nutrition books through the years, and this has to be one of the best.I had already put into practice many of Dr. Sears advice by eliminating junk food, eating grass fed beef, wild salmon, and more green vegetables.  
I was especially impressed by the chapters on exercise.  I have never been a fan of extened cardio, so I will now be using the PACE program in addition to the weight training that I am already doing.
In the past, high carb and high starch had caused me to gain 20 pounds over four years.  Now, with Dr. Sears' program, I have been dropping a steady pound a week with no hunger problems.  Plus, I feel much more energetic.
I would definitely recommend this book
