I read this book since i wanted to understand the business world. This book was very insightful about open book leadership and motivating employees with numbers and equity in the company. I saw some comments from others stating the chaina product price will beat all these principles. I think this guy got partial truth in his statement. A good business will do business using resources from chaina and focus on the advantages they have locally (Marketing and Selling). Principles are principles anywere. Awesome way to start the game. :-
