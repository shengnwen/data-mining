I've just passed the CCDA exam with this book as my primary resource. The book is fully packed with information so that every sentence has to be read thoroughly in order to avoid overlooking some important facts. The author's style of writing is a little dry, so are the topics itself. Fortunately the are many case studies that will help you to apply the theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios which is vital for passing the exam.

Even though this book covers everything I would not recommend using it as your only resource. It will leave you alone with this overwhelming density of information and avoids giving some advice which topics are important in order to pass the exam. Titles like "CCDA/CCDP Flash Cards and Exam Practice Pack" or "Top-Down Network design" will help you in getting the "big picture" and serve as final exam prepartion tools
