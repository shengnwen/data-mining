Dennis Lehane, to me, is one the most gifted fiction writers of our time.  Patrick and Angela are not your cookie cutter detectives and A Drink before the War is not your ordinary mystery/thriller.  It's hard to talk about this book with out giving too much away...but trust me when I say that you won't be sorry when you read this book.  And when you're done-you'll do what I did--buy the entire series
