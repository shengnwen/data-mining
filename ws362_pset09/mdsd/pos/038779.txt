This is one very good science book.  If you would like to do a seed project then this is a good guide to lots of young peoples questions about plants.  It has colorful illustrations about what is happening with your  project.  It is written in detail, but not like a boring high school  science textbook that goes on, and on, and on about one thing, giving every  detail that there is.  So what I'm trying to say  is that this is a good  book
