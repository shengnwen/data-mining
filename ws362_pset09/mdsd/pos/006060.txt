...critics of McWilliams writings decry that they are too simplistic and too broadstroking to really offer true solutions. But that is not exactly right. These books are offering solutions, if only to give the reader the confidence to live and to seek creative, positive solutions to some of the more serious problems posed to them in their real lives. The are meant to be inspirational and practical rather than some dried up clinical study with answers if you can follow these steps...actually that's the inside joke about this... This book is typical McWilliams. One page has his "don't no body bring me no bad news" examples, his easy to follow directions and text. The opposing page has a pithy quote from some hi-falootin classical philosopher or (more likely) a tv character we grew up with like Mary Richards or Fred Sanford--in fact in the age of Dr. Phil, I wonder if the McWilliams estate would be so inclined to upgrade this book for a younger generation. (...) but do yourself a favor by having hard copies of the books, too. You will want to carry them around with you a lot
