The language in this book is so magical.  It's one that you almost need to read in one sitting because of the flow.  It pulls you in and entangles you like the rose bush thorns in the story entangle Rois.  To me there were elements of such classic stories as those of Thomas Hardy and "Wuthering Heights".  This book takes you to another world and is poetically written
