I was read this book as a child in an elementary school classroom.  As anyone knows, in an elementary school classroom, a teacher may read up to three books a day to her students.  Out of all the books I was read through my elementary school "career", I am still amazed at this book.  Although it is unrealistic, it is magical and the illustrations are fantastic.  Just seeing the pictures again makes me feel like a little kid.  Out of hundreds of books that were read to me, I remember this book.  If you have an imagination and are able to let go of reality and enjoy a good book, this is an excellent read
