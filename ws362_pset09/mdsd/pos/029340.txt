Captain Shane Schofield, UMSC, call-sign "Scarecrow", returns in Matthew Reilley's second installation of another mayhem-filled Scarecrow-experience. Having been promoted to "captain" Schofield is now a keeper of the President of the United States of America. However, as a routine secret facility visit goes bust, with the President smack dab in the middle, it is up to Schofield and his merry Marine crew to save the President, and America for that matter.

To put this simply, do not ever read this book if you can't accept a work of fiction, no matter how amazingly unbelievable and fantastic it may be, as purely FICTION. Hats off to Reilly for once again allowing me to be free with my imagination with the help of his work. This book, having read prior to ICE STATION, is the only book in which I remember gasping and saying "Oh my gawd!" outloud. 

The action grabs you and, unlike other books I've read, the illustrations and maps help you understand exactly what's happening.

Unbelievable? Yes. But this IS a work of fiction that involves fantastic elements to put you in a *whoa* mood. I've yet to pick up a book that would do to me what Reilly has.

Why not a 5-star rating? Well, in all honesty, Reilly's attempt at the romance between Scarecrow and Fox fizzles and dies before it even begins. It's possible for him to be in a relationship, but the chemistry between him and Fox isn't even "warm". It seems that Reilly "struggles" to develop this romantic relationship although he started it off well with Ice Station. Reilly should take baby steps when dealing with relationships in his "Scarecrow" novels
