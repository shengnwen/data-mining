The Bible,Battle for the Mind and A Seer out of Season are my 3 top lifetime books.
A Seer out of Season is a sensitive portrayal of the life of a most remarkable, yet very ordinary, man. You get the full picture, together with warts. No over-sentimental, hero-worship here. Just a simple story, simply told - and simply full of wonder.
I remember well the author quoting Cayce as saying, &quot;I do nothing you can't do.&quot; A remarkable
 assertion when you see what Cayce did.
 And you will see what Cayce did if you read this book. It will change your view of self, life and
 eternity.
 Looking for a meaning to it all? Then have a read of this. You will find it cuts across all the boundaries and unites the mind and soul in a harmony you couldn't think existed. Journey into the new you and the new world of you with this book
