I browsed and scanned countless translations of this book.  I already had Mitchell's in mind because I had read his Bhagavad Gita and his Rilke and found it to be amazing.  But all other translations seemed to fall short.  This is by far the best translation of the Tao Te Ching out there.  It is eloquent and beautiful, and simply and subtle.  The poetry of the words is matched well with the unbelievable beauty of the accompanying art.  Buy this book.  Now.  This is the most valuable thing one can read.  If they taught this in high schools the world would be a better place
