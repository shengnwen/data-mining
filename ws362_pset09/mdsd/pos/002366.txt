I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a very pleasant surprised because I have found the last couple of dark hunter books to be very average.  I loved the character development, the building of their relationship and the secondary characters.  This was a great afternoon reading escape and has actually made me look forward to, rather than dread, the next episode in this imaginative series.  Thank you Sherrilyn
