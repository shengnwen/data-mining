I originally checked this out from my local library but liking it so much I decided I had to get one for myself. The "effectiveness" ratings for each recipe is a big plus and gave me confidence to try it out, (the effectiveness rating is based on people who actually tried the recipe and rated the recipe's effectiveness, how it worked for them).  I especially like the earth paste recipe, as it lasts a long time and I have a 4 yr old who takes baths in our tub.  It is nice to know that when we get his water ready that there isn't any harmful powdered clorox in his bath; that he is bathing in a clean bath tub, free of harmful harsh chemicals. So, I was not only thrilled to find this book but even more thrilled that the recipes worked, and I didn't have to spend a whole lot of money. The most expensive things were the essential oils and castille soap but for both, a little really does go a long way.  I've read some similar books on the subject and thought this was the most practical and easy to use book. It makes cleaning fun because, you make it yourself, and you can be creative with the scents and decorating the containers. Since I started using the recipes in this book my home has smelled better, to include the kitchen sink (we don't have a dishwasher/ I have to wash my dishes daily by hand, and I haven't had a smelly dishrag since).
