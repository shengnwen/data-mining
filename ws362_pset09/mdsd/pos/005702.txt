I found this book to be a good read. I like the fact that it is a continuation of St. Leger family. I thought the romance was good. The characters are interesting. I feel that The Bride Finder is a better book than this one. But this one is still an enjoyable read. You can read this as a separate story and be quite happy with it. Although I would recommend reading the Bride Finder first to get a better read of this book
