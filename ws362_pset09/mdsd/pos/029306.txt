     Mama Gena is not the blanket cure for marriage problems, but she is honest in her beliefs about how joy affects the lives of everyone. She believes in living in the moment, and to learn to accept responsibilty for the joy in your own life. She never claims to be a marriage band-aid. Yes, she is getting a divorce, but that has no bearing on her books.
     Some marriages have to end for the benefit of both partners, and she is a human being and therefore subject to the whims of life, just like we all are. I think it's sad whenever a relationship of so many years ends, but obviously it was in the best interest of the two people involved.      
     What the rest of us believe about them and their relationship, has nothing to do with the fact that she is a good writer. She has helped thousands of couples, and that there is a possibility that she is just what you have been looking for. She helped me realize that I cannot sit and wait for my husband to make me happy when I have never even tried to do that myself. That I cannot expect him to read my mind when I don't even know what I want. Sound obvious? When you become a wife, its amazing the logic that you allow to become fuzzy. Its sad that they are breaking up, but there is perfection in everything, she will find it in this. She never claimed to have a perfect relationship with her hubby. What do you think started her off on this course of marriage guidance. I'll bet she and her hubby had a wild ride before thy decided to part ways. She doesn't have all the answers, but she is a very intelligent lady
