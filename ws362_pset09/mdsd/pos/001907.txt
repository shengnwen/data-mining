A book by one of the most eminent writers on the psychology of death and dying, this volume goes through what the dying have to say to doctors, nurses, clergy and their own families. Other than the introductory chapters on the stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance, this volume is devoted to the interviews given by severely ill and dying patients to a class of medical and pastoral care professionals and those studying to fill these roles. The course was a collaboration between the medical school and college for the clergy; thus there is a strong Christian element. First, this grated on me a bit because of its exclusivity, but I soon realised that patients who chose to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and a chaplain would probably do so because of an already existing faith, which put things in perspective.
Munch of the information provided is enlightening and eminently current; much of the rest is dated - after all, this book was written in the late 60s.
I was particularly interested in the reactions of staff and other professionals to course and its results - I would hope that, with the evolution of medical teaching, there would not be a little less resitance, but I cannot judge that.
The second revelation were the family relationships and patterns revealed by the patient interviews - I'm currently studying family therapy ["Families and How to survive them" Skynnewr/Cleese] and this was highly relevant
