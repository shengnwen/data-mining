In school my class and I read the book the Wish Giver. This book is about three kids who each receive a magic card from a small, chubby, mysterious little man named Thaddeus Blinn. When each child makes a wish , the wish turns out the wrong way. The moral of the story is "Be Careful what you wish for". This was a very interesting book. I really enjoyed it. Bill Brittain was a wonderful author. I highly reccomend this book.
