The book is a series of lectures given by the author in 1901-02. The academic language takes a little getting used to, yet once accustomed the material is presented in an effective manner. This is a good book for someone who would like to explore rationale why different types of religions exist, their relation to each other, types of individuals that gravitate to each, and whether or not there is a creating spirit which resides in all. Dispells some of the notion "My way is right and if you don't believe it, ask me." Good for the person who is open-minded and seeking.
