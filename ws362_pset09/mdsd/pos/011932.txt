This is a great collection of short stories. Each one was like a little gem I could hold in my hand. Orringer's characters are well thought out and each story reads like it could be turned into a novel. Some I thought ended at the perfect point, while others left me begging for more. Highly recommended for fans of short stories, but also recommended to someone who hasn't liked story collections in the past. I think this book could change your mind.
