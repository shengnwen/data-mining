I'm still reading it but since the first chapter I found it  enlightening. Like many others I think this book is a milestone. If you manage sites it's a good idea to read it. I've already discovered and fixed some subtle mistakes on my site.
I previously read also "Call to Action" and "Persuasive Online Copywriting" and all of them worth consideration, but they seem rather a collection of articles
