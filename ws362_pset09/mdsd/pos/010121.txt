  The Moves Make The Man, by Bruce Brooks is one of the most dynamic books ever. Even though I don't like reading much, I enjoyed this book and I didn't want to stop reading it. Many times in the book it showed compassion and friendship. I think that is a great thing that all characters should share. 
  These characters had a special bonding that could not be broken. When Jerome first moved to the new school, he had to make new friends. Bix, a boy that Jerome met through the course of the year, became best friends with Jerome. They started to trust each other and I think that was shown when Bix starts to flip out in the classroom.
  I rated this book a five because of the friendship bond between the characters was incredible. Most books have a bond, but none were this powerful and thats what makes this book incredible. DeLarry A. Carte
