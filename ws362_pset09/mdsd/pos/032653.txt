Namath was a fantastic quarterback and a major icon of the 1960s and 1970s.  (I can recall when every kid on the playground wanted a  Joe Namath jacket or lunchbox.)  This book does a fantastic job of recounting Namath's career and the major influence he had on professional football.  No other player since Namath has made such a historical impact both on and off the field, and he brought some genuine style to the game.  For at least one generation of Americans, he was once upon a time the game's greatest athelete - and the coolest dude alive.  A well-written and inspiring biography that would probably translate nicely into a movie.
