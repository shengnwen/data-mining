If you feel troubled by the "real" world - take comfort.  In his final meditations, Anthony De Mello reminds us that it is all an illusion.  Whenever I feel like it's all too much for me I open up The Way To Love. In this beautiful, tiny volume you will find larger than life inspiration.  This book can and will change your life.

Here's my favorite quote from the book:

"...every time you strive to improve on Nature by going against it, you will damage yourself, for Nature is our very being.  It is as if your right hand were to fight your left hand or your right foot were to stamp on your left foot.  Both sides lose and, instead of being creative and alive, you are locked in conflict.  This is the state of most people in the world.  

Take a look at them:  dead, uncreative, stuck because they are locked in conflict with Nature, attempting to improve themselves by going against what their nature demands.  In a conflict between Nature and your brain, back Nature; if you fight her, she will eventually destroy you.  The secret therefore is to improve on Nature in harmony with Nature.
