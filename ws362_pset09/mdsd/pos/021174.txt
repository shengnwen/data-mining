I have read a number of Elmore Leonard books before reading Be Cool and have hears a number of people I respected tell me how great Leonard was, but I just never got it.  Sure, the characters were all cool and the plotlines exciting, but the way these people loved him there always seemed like there was something more. I couldn't find that in any of the books I'd read before this one, and so I just didn't get it.  Then I come across Be Cool.

The way I see it the book is more than Hollywood insider jokes and irreverant colorful characters and zany capers.  When Leonard writes about Chili Palmer he's really writing about himself.  Replace Chili with Elmore and you get what he's talking about.  You get the idea that Leonard is really telling you how he creates the novels he's written.  He finds a bunch of cool characters, puts them in the same room and find out what happens -- just like Chili Palmer.  It is so important that the characters drive the plot that it almost feels to him like they're writing the story and he's just taking notes.  And he seems to find the things about the characters that make them special -- mobsters in sneakers and sweatshirts in Hollywood studios.  And through all the marketing tactics and the different editors trying to change things and the money on the line, he's trying to keep his book true to itself just like the rock band, Odessa.  He hopes he succeeds.

This may or may not be his best, but it's the one that taught me how Leonard worked.  And I've gone on to reread some of the others I had read previously and got a little more out of it because I knew there was something more I could expect from the novelist, I just had to dig a little deeper.
