The best thing about this book are the illustrations. They are absolutely gorgeous with so much attention to detail and creating some beautiful scenes. The story is an interesting twist on the traditional Cinderella story that is well told with a story that is easy to follow and that many children will enjoy in the telling, especially with the illustrations to further bring the story to life. The only bad part is that it tries to rhyme throughout and sometimes some of the rhymes don't work as well as others
