I am just about to finish this translation of Tasso's venerable crusade and I just had to express how wonderful I think it is.  I have to admit I experienced a slight bit of trepidation before beginning this work, but I was found to be foolish.  Not only is the work readable, it loses none of its beauty in the translation.  I have found myself reading page to page hungrily.  Who needs mass market paperback best sellers when oen has such a unique and beautifully translated work at one's fingertips.  I wholeheartedly recommend this translation
