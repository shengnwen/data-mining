Light and Dark clash yet again
Up in the hills of Wales
They really are alive this time
There's music in these tales

Deep in a hill there lies a harp
The wondrous Harp of Gold
One of the Old Ones' Things of Power
It's High Magic controlled

It's Will again who has the task
To end the Sleepers rest
Welsh folklore joins with King Arthur
And Will's put to the test

His new friend Bran's a mystery
He's much more than he seems
His mother left him as a babe
And dashed a good man's dreams

The Brenin Llwyd, or The Grey King
Observes their every error
His breath it forms the clammy fog
His Milgwn provide terror

Caradog Prichard is obsessed
Something's killing his sheep
He blames the dogs who aren't at fault
His anger rages deep

Will they stand against the Dark,
Will they fulfill their quest?
"The Dark is Rising" rates above
But this one's second best.
