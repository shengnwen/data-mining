I bought this when I was reading Get With the Program but it is actually a great journal.

The front and back cover w/ Bob Greene's face can be removed w/ out hurting the journal. You then have a nice spiral bound journal that says "Daily Journal" on the front in blue lettering on white with a white cardboard back that is hard enough to let you write well in the journal.

The book has a good two page daily lay out where you can record you cardio, weights and eating habits w/ or w/out the program. There is also enough space to write your daily thoughts and/or listing of foods if you are keeping a food diary.

It is a great size and just a nice item if you are tracking your health
