Five years ago, my children and I listened, spellbound, to Darlene's taped testimony, and I was delighted to purchase this book a few weeks ago from our church bookstore.

Few experiences in my life have affected me as has this story.

Darlene's website, www.heronco.com is worth visiting to get an update and info about a new movie and book in the works.  It is exciting and humbling to know all that she has gone through and know that her faith, instead of being shattered, has grown brighter, purer and deeper in the fire.

I will enjoy spending eternity with Darlene and those like her. This world is not our home - sometimes we forget.
