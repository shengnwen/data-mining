I enjoyed soul Harvest, mostly because I am a sucker for action novels with apocalyptic events and I've come to like the characters, despite the fact that they are virtually interchangeable. In soul harvest Ray, Buck (the cradle-robber), and his college-girlfriend-turned-stepford-wife are in real trouble when the big quake hits and they are all separated. Can Buck find Chloe? Can ray find Amanda? Do we care?

I admit I never liked Amanda, and found Ray's mourning, and hand-wringing a bit annoying. Ray's obsession with proving Amanda's innocence was ridiculous, and reading about another saintly dead wife is a drag. Likewise Buck's frenetic search for Chloe reminds me of the last book when Chloe injured her foot in the quake. I'm not a big fan of Buck/Chloe romance either. He's way too old for her.

My reservations aside, I LIKED Soul Harvest. Much less preachy than previous novels, and some good characters were introduced.

I still feel LaHaye lacks the ability to write deep characters, as his Christian characters are too saintly and lack flaws. Once a character becomes a 'believer' it seems to make him a mindless flawless robot who all believe the same way. No variation. No questioning.  LaHaye seems to equate Christian=Zombie. Also the Trib force seems a little callous, and cruel. Towards the end of the book when they were badgering sick Hattie to "Find God" I was disgusted. It reminded me of the Catholic priests badgering the Hawaiians to convert as they lay on their deathbeds suffering from pox. It's up to God to judge who will go to heaven, not up to the tribulation force. When Ray says he believes Hattie will go to "Hell" because she hasn't been born again  I felt he'd crossed a line into a judgmental bigot. Only God will decide who will go to Heaven and Hell. Not Ray. 

4 stars. Read it for the action, and a bit of good religion. Don't expect much from the characters. They're all alike, and sometimes their sanctimony and pretension can be tiresome
