This book paints just one example of how our thoughts and our behavior on the same subjects differ greatly.  We all think we like the massive number of choices, and we want to go to the shop with the greatest selection and most flexibility.

The only reason that I don't give this a five star review is because his suggestions on how to reduce dissatisfaction when it comes to choosing are un-implamentable.  And given his clear research oriented critical thinking skills, Schwartz should have known better
