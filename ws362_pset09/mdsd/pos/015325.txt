Caldwell's stories are very sharp, concise and pointed. No word is wasted in his deceptively simple way of adressing Southern life in America. This anthology of short stories makes it pretty obvious that Caldwell ought to be read for years to come. Far more than a vulgar comedian; he is one of the very few writers that really manage to satirize the crudest, meanest, lowliest people you ever saw, and still come across as a story-teller who loves his characters
