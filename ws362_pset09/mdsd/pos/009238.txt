I'm too young to be a core Beach Boys fan, but my parents, their friends, and many in their generation seem to have an affinity for this sun & surf sensation that this band inspired. I was somewhat fascinated by the story of their lives; the turmoil, the magnitude of their fame, and the challenges they overcame - invididually and collectively - to become one of the most successful and recognized bands in history.
