Peters book ios a send-up of the classic English country house party mystery, featuring a super-woman sleuth (one thoroughly versed in history and Karate who knows all the tunes not only of Pinafore, but all of Gilbert and Sullivan), a bunch of silly characters, surrounding a totally implausible plot. As she gleefully indicates, this is no Josephine Tey investigation of history, though it does poke fun at those who take their history too seriously. Overall an engaging way to pass the time aimlessly
