Loved the book - use it with her videos and without -- find it easy to understand compared to most other patterns available today.  This book will never leave my library.  Her teaching method allows me to design my own patterns without a lot of fuss. Writes in a way that makes me feel like she is sitting in the living room helping out. She simplifies everything she can and makes knitting friendly again. --And that doesnt mean she is making simple sweaters - it just means she is making beautiful sweaters easy to knit.  Full price would be a bargain for this book!  Happy Knitting
