Harvard, Homosexuality, and the Shaping of American Culture is, perhaps, an unfortunate sub-title for the otherwise interesting The Crimson Letter by Douglas Shand-Tucci as it does not quite live up to this rather grandiose idea of shaping american culture.  The book, though, is still a fascinating stroll through the past hundred years of Harvard history.  It starts a little slowly with the author setting up two archetypes but gathers steam as the twentienth century takes flight.  The author does wander around the topic at times as the personality presented connections to Harvard are stretched or evidence of his homosexuality is tenuously produced but he keeps the narrative flowing in and among the varied characters populating this history.  A rewarding read for the anyone who sticks with it
