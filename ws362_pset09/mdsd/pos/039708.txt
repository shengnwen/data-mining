I really loved this book.  Leslie goes over all of her signature moves in pictures, there's a 6-week journal with assigned exercise and tips for each day and success stories.  Beyond the six week program, you also get two more walk schedules, suggestions for eating better, etc.  Plus it's all in color - which is always fun.  

The downside to this book - which is only why I took a star away is the awful 1-mile walk DVD that comes with it.  If I could rate both separatedly, the book would get 5 stars, the DVD only 1.  

Leslie works out alone and that's fine with me, but she constantly walks out of time with the music.  And the editing is a joke!  At one point, she's suppose to be walking and the screen abruptly cuts to her kicking and then quickly goes back to walking.  There's also a spot near the end where she's suppose to be doing knee lifts to the count of four but only does one.  No cooldown either!

Bottom line - do buy the book, but if you are new to Leslie, give her other workouts a try .. any but this one.
