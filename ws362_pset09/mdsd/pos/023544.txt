If you are looking for "management" book that recycles the organization scripts that appear in many other books, look elsewhere.  Mr. Koch's book successfully links the performance of the individual employee, the company, and societies progress in the battle for more freedom and less control.  This is a novel connection.

While all of the Market-Based Management dimensions are worth study, decision rights and incentives are two that really struck home.  Giving employees the freedom to make decisions is earned by good performance.  Employee performance is what decides compensation.  Many others preach this, but Koch Industries has proved it.

Incentives must be aligned by the manager to match up: What is good for me (employee)?, What is good for the company/organization?, and What is good for society?  This is a difficult task and requires critical thinking, but crucial and often overlooked.

This book works for those in the private sector as well as the non-profit world.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a fresh take on management.
