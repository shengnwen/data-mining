This book is an excellent resource for preparing for the PHR exam.  I would not count on using it exclusively, but when combined with other available resources, it has much to offer in exam preparation.  Not only does the book provide a great deal of human resources information, it also provides tips for studying, preparing, as well as many practice questions to let you know you where you need extra effort.  I know this book helped me in passing my exam
