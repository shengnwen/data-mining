Historian Philbrick's well-researched, well-written account retells the story of the Pilgrims sailing the Mayflower, starting in England, proceeding to Holland, and eventually arriving in today's Massachusetts for what I can only imagine to be the flu and cold season from hell. There's already an English colony in Virginia, a Dutch colony in New Amsterdam, but this is the first English settlement in what would be called the New England area, though it's hardly virgin soil. The land has been colonized and farmed by Native Americans, who have recently suffered a devasting loss of population due to disease, brought by European Traders. Despite this population loss, the Pilgrim settlement is vastly outnumbered and appears to be granted a gracious reprieve from massacre during its first years. Philbrick continues with the story we never learned or celebrated in grade school. 55 years after settling in Plymouth, the British settlers precarious truce with the Native American population collapses, and King Philip's War, a major conflict with ugly episodes follows. The British settlers seem to be on the losing side until they adopt the native population's military style and things turn around for them
