Intended at students, the feynman lectures in stanford were much attended by researchers. The same holds for the book. It provides a new way to teach physics that has kept its full originality. Not the least, it is highly pedagogical, introducing every new subject step by step. Emphasis is on the physics reasoning more than on the maths. As such, it is a great source of inspiration to physicists and physics teachers.
