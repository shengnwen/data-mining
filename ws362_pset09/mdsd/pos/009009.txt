The Elements of Style makes grammatical research so easy, you'll want to look up things you'd always wondered about but thought would take too much time. Recently someone asked me about the use of the serial comma, and, as it was about text we were going to put on the dust jacket of a book, it was sufficiently important to look up. It turned out to be the second item in the Table of Contents. First you get the general rule, in this case "In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last." The example given is "gold, silver, or copper." The sole exception is a series of names in a business: "Brown, Shipley and Co." There! With thirty seconds effort, the issue was adjudicated. I can't recommend it highly enough. Thank God for the Fourth Edition. My Third Edition is dog-eared with use
