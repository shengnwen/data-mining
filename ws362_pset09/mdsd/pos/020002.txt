This companion to the hugely popular television show provides good context and background for viewers (like me) of the show.  It would have gotten five stars, but there is more focus on the actors' histories, and some details were left out, otherwise, not bad.  I'd recommend the "script" book and the larger West Wing book.  The lines in "A Proportional Response", ironically, apply to the current situation in Iraq.  Check out the lines:  "...death of an American, any American, and we come back with total disaster..." and you'll see what I mean
