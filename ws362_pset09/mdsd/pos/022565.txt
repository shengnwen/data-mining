This book is very enjoyable. It not only explains what sacred geometry is,  it gives you exercises to do using basic tools like a compass, graph paper  and a pencil. After reading and doing the fun and educational  illustrations, you'll be looking for sacred geometry everywhere around you  as well as spotting it in famous works of art and architecture
