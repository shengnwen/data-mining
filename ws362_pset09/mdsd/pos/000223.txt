I would say this is my favorite Koontz book.  While it isn't heavy on murder and mahem to the extent some of his others are, it keeps you guessing and turning the page.  I have also found it's a good book to recommend to someone who isn't familiar with Koontz or hasn't liked him in the past.  I also have the audio CD, also very well done
