When I picked up this book years ago at a clearance center, I had no idea what a big deal it was. Now reading so many arguments about it, I have to lend my two cents. If I was a book critic or professional writer, I may offer similar words of contempt... but this book entered my life at the exactly right moment; I was young, self-absorbed, and still struggling to define the differences between passion and love and sex. This book doesn't lend any answers or insight- it just reflects those crazy feelings in a way that I found thoroughly, sensually entertaining. I did not care how well it represented asian culture, but having some asian heritage, I did find it refreshing to hear a strong young female asian voice.
