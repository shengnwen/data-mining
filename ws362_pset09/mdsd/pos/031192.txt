Junie B. Jones Cheater Pants is really funny! I think you should read it because.....  I just thought it was really funny and I just like reading Junie B. Jones. I showed my teacher alot of funny things and she thought it was funny too. Like when may was saying tin can instead of Cinquain and then she argued with her teacher about it. You should read it!
