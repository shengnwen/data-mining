Well, Sebastian Howell has laid it all out in black and white.  The author has described the process in universal terms, meaning you could apply her principles to any geographical area.  

This book is easy to understand and deals in both the basics and the more complex material.  It starts off with simple explanations and moves on to understanding the market and the business of making money through buying and selling houses.  It gives clear definitions of the legal terms and the jargon that you'll come across in the industry.  The author also clearly explains the various people you will associate with and their roles on your team.  I really appreciated the examples used in the book.  They help to clarify the material.  The section covered on financing is comprehensive and understandable with tips to pulling it altogether.

One the most beneficial sections in the book is a complete list of what to look for in a `flippable' house.

She deals with renovating properties and then moves the reader onto the selling process.  The added bonus to the book is the comprehensive index at the back
