Carolina Moon was my first venture into work by Jill McCorkle, but it certainly won't be my last.  I loved the characters in this book: Quee, Denny, Tom.  And it's been a long time since I read a book and laughed  outloud, not once but often.  There's more to it than just laughs,however.   I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys great characters, intriguing  plotting, and mystery.   And if you don't think that having great fun with  a book automatically means it can't also be great fiction, then this may be  the book for you
