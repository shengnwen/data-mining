Brick Lane is a novel about Nazneen, a Bangladeshi woman who moves to London for an arranged marriage with a Bangladeshi man who had been living there for several years before. In the background of the story is the pre and post 9/11 lives of Muslim immigrants in the west provided from Nazneen's perspective. The character struggles with the question "can people change their fate?" Nazneen herself was born as a very weak baby and was left to her fate by her family because they believed one should not intervene with what has been planned for them. But Nazneen also doubts "if one changes the course of fate, may be their fate was such that the course of events were meant to be altered anyway."
  
The book became controversial in the Bangladeshi community in London especially when a film based on the book was planned to be made. Some felt that the book or the film would give the wrong impression about Bangladeshi life in London.

This book was a difficult read for me since I did not really feel much affection for any of the characters. This may of course be because the author made them so real that they had all the faults that real people have
