After reading this book, I realized that part of me wanted a kitchen that would impress others.  That aim partly conflicted with my personal aesthetic preferences and the way I like to live and cook.  What inspired me the most in this book was seeing kitchens for cooks I revere.  The diversity of kitchens is refreshing because many of the design magazines these days are focused on particular "looks."  The pictures in the book are very good.  Paul Bertolli's kitchen is interesting in that it doesn't have upper cabinets.  I never considered not having upper cabinets, but it made the space feel much brighter and larger.  The author also presents a floor plan for each kitchen and I found this really helpful for understanding kitchen dynamics.
