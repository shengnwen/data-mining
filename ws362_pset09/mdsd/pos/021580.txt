Great book.  Essential read.
Journalistic Distance?  Discretion please!  After reading the Publisher's Weekly review of this book, I had to respond.
The Publisher's Weekly review of this book misses the point.  It wreaks of the sentiment in which "journalistic distance" and the pursuit of objectivity is the one and only noble literary path.
Perhaps the books sipmly violates the reviewers sense of genre and style.  Spare the public the small mindedness.
The author is a veteran writer, and in this time when the country has fallen over to the Right, there is no time to stand on the fence (or write from it).  It has all happened and is well personal... and for the most part our (US citizens) heads are deep in the sand.  "Distance" is what got us in trouble.
What nobility, or value, was there in those German journalists who pursued "distance" or objectivity during the rise of Nazism?
When things become as extreme as they have, it's time for some scholastic subjectivity.  Tell it from the heart. No more ivory tower b.s.
I write this assuming that the reviewer has a solid knowledge of history, and not only the versions written by the victors.  The consequences are too dire not to learn from history.

This is a crucial book in this time.  The mechasnisms which those in power employ to control and manipulate the public must be made transparent.  This is where change begins.  This particular method, through co-opting Christianity, is by no means original though.  After all, Emperor Constintine gave new meaning to the winter solstice.

Stand for something!  Truths and rights eternally!
Don't hide behind "journalistic distance".  Make it personal, intelligent, immediate and from the heart.  Come full blast and let the professional reveiwers struggle with their own sensibilities and alien perspectives.
The book itself is an important read.  Respect to the author of the book... Dan Wakefield.
