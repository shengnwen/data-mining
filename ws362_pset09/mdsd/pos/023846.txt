The other reviews cover most of the issues with this book admirably.  One could have appropriately, but less titilatingly, retitled the book "Unions in Pre-Modern Europe", since his study was fairly balanced between two-sex and same-sex unions.  It is certainly an eye-opener for those of the "traditional" marriage hue and cry.  "Traditional" marriage as we see it today was unknown until the late middle ages, although that sort of union among same-sex couples was known from the earliest.  The church did not recognize marriage as a sacrament until about 800 years ago.  Those today who speak of traditional marriage need to read their history to know whereof they speak.  I found his writing immensely readable and enjoyable.  Although I have not yet read his first work, it is certainly now on my list
