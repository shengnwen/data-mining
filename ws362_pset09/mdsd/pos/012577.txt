Stephen Pinker's revolutionary work and the resultant writings stand at the precipice of a new era of understanding into the marvels of being human and what it is that makes us "us". This work, and his most recent ("The Blank Slate") will one day be held out as the first tentative baby steps toward what will certainly be our greater unlocking of the secrets of the brain.

What really makes Pinker's work accessible is his breezy tone (and I mean that as a complement).  Many great scientists are good researchers but very poor writers.  Pinker, on the other hand, knows how to communicate his ideas in a facile and utile manner, allowing even those without a Ph.D. to quickly and effectively grasp his many cogent points and references.  By choosing not to talk down to, or over the heads of his readers, Pinker assures that more and more people will be drawn into his world of grand paradigm-shattering concepts and will grow to marvel and appreciate all that makes us who we are
