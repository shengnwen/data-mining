I wanted to know how to make a good movie on the cheap and turn a profit. Rodriguez shows us how. His journal arranges actors, cameras, and sets based on what's available. For instance, there's little dialogue, so there's no need for a sound crew. He writes the scenes around available locations. When blank rounds don't work on the "real" guns (rented from the police), he edits the scene to look like automatic weapons are used.
The guys that get shot in the bar are...local patrons. The guy who plays the bartender is...the bartender. And the bodyguard is played by...you guessed it, the actor's bodyguard/driver!
After finishing this book, I realized that Rodriguez isn't the first director to make a $7000 movie. Roger Corman did it for 20 years. He shot movies over a week and made 700% profit. Russ Meyer did it, the Italian Giallo directors did it, and India's Bollywood directors do it too. You CAN make a good crime drama or comedy if you have the following...
1. A great idea.
2. Carefull planning
3. A script/plot written with available actors/props/locations in mind.
4. A sense of self-mockery, so your friends and neighbors will happily participate in your insane project.
5. A 2nd hand camera, borrowed from a friend.
All Rodriguez spent money on was the film. The rest was all volunteer actors and cast-off doodads. In Once Upon a Time in Mexico, they didn't even use real gunfire. They shot Banderas with a black watergun and added the flares in the computer.
If you want to see an example of a micro-budget crime movie, rent anything from Maverick Films
