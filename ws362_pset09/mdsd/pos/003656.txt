I loved the insights and exercises given to help overcome the fear of speaking in public....and I don't mean just professional public speaking. Learning how to connect with others in a group, no matter how small, is something I always had a hard time doing...Roger Love teaches that posture, gestures, and breathing correctly, along with a positive inner dialogue can help you feel and sound more confident. The fact that this is on CD is so much better than if it were something written....he is so inspiring to listen to and his stories about his famous clients are wonderful and quite entertaining. This audio book will help so many people who are just a little shy and need to know how to communicate easily with others
