This book is a must have for anyone working in the Information Assurance/Computer Security field.  &quot;Big Blue&quot; was written by experienced professionals who are considered experts in their field. The book contains sections pertaining to every conceivable aspect of Infomation Assurance. I am currently using this book in my Masters program at Norwich University, and will continue to use it as a reference for many years to come.  Mich Kabay and Sy Bosworth are to be commended for consolidating all of this information into one superb book.  Great job!
