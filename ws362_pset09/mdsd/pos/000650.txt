This was the text required for my personnell management class. (200 level) I have the Bohlander 13th ed. which is a better text, being better organised. But after going through this book I liked it as well. The last chapter on international HR issues was especially helpful. I have adapted the expatriate worker technoques to address interdepartmental issues in my organization. I understand there will be a new edition out in June 2006. Perhaps it will be better organized
