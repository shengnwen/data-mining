This book is a great look at a part of history that is all but forgotten to us now.  We've all seen the Goodyear blimp flying over a Monday Night Football game and thought, 'that's pretty neat,' but few of us alive today can imagine a time when the great airships were seen by many as the future of air travel.  This book is a fascinating glimpse into a forgotten era, when the sight of a giant zeppelin overhead could captivate an entire town like New York, and bring traffic to a stop.  It was a time when the entire world was riveted by the around the world flight of the Graf Zeppelin as it made history.  If you are merely curious about zeppelins, this will make you a passionate fan.  If you're already a fan, this will put the struggle to create the zeppelins and their collapse during World War II into a greater contest that will show you how different flying could have been, if not for the time in which the zeppelins thrived
