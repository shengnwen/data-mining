Recently moved from California to the East.  Sibley's guide for Western North America was the guide my mentor in birding used the most, so I knew when I arrived at my new home that getting this guide for Eastern birds was a priority.  I was not disappointed.  It is my only guide for this area, and I have no need for an alternative/backup guide.  It is very user friendly for novice birdwatching identification, yet challenges me to go deeper with my general bird knowledge.  Strongly recommended to all birdwatchers, from novices to the experienced.
