I don't have a scientific background, so this book was a struggle for me.  There were many aspects of the similarities between Eastern Mysticism and Quantum Physics that I found to be quite interesting, but I have to admit that some of the scientific discussion was over my head.  I think the author did an excellent job of explaining a series of difficult subjects.  Mystic experiences are difficult enough to put into words, but I don't even think a language exists to explain recent developments in physics.  In any event, there is something to be gained from reading this book, even if you don't have "a scientific mind.
