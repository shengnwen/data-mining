Although I'm an avid reader, I usually don't read plays, but decided to give Death of a Salesman a try because it was supposed to be one of the best pieces of American literature.  After reading it, I have to say that it is quite deserving of that title.

To sum up the storyline without giving too much away, it is about a man who is dealing with his own pride in the face of failure, and his relationship with his son (who he deeply loves), who is also a failure.  More importantly, Death of a Salesman takes a hard look at the American Dream and asks: Is it worth it?

The thing that this play so great to me was the characters.  Willy and Biff Loman are two characters you won't soon forget (Willy especially).  As I really enjoyed this play (and as it only took about three hours to read), I'm going to have to scan Amazon for a couple of other plays to read
