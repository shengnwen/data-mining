At the very worst, The Martian Chronicles is a fantastic piece of Fantasy/Literature. At it's best, it is a masterpiece that simply succeeds at everything. While it may be a collection of short stories, Ray Bradbury molds all of them together beautifully into one coherent whole. This book is very dark but has a surprisingly optimistic and happy ending. The Martian Chronicles should be required reading in all high schools.

The Martian Chronicles is my third favorite Bradbury book after Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes, though in some parts it was more enjoyable than both books.

FIVE stars. Keep writing masterpieces, Ray
