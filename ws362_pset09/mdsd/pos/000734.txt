This book is to adult movie posters as Art of Rock is to music posters.  The posters themselves are great, and the book is in itself a great reference guide to exploitation films of the era. These posters are not obscene by any means, and so even if you are not interested in adult films you may enjoy the posters based solely on their artistic originality and merit.  They surely bespeak a more creative and exciting time in world culture.  I advise listening to some good lounge music and sipping an ice-cold martini as you flip through this first-rate book.  Truly, this will be a collector's item.

But I must add that I share a frustration with the other reviewers: Where is Volume II????  Once that is released and I have it on my shelf, I would like to extend my congratulations to the producers of this work: you did it right and created a valuable documentation of this aspect of 20th century social history, an interesting aspect indeed
