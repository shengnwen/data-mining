Hearing of this new Horst book I wondered how much new material there could be above and beyond his previous books? The answer is: a lot! This big new volume has ten chapters of  new or refined information that in many cases presented ideas I had not even thought of before with regards to climbing performance&gt; One slight con to the book is the at times technical nature but overall the book is loaded with practical ideas I can begin using this winter to improve my training&gt; There are also countless mental training&lt; nutrition and recovery tips I look forward to trying out on the rocks In the end its a wonderful book that I could not put down
