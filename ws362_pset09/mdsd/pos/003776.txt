If you want to try Joseph Finder's work, PARANOIA is a good place to start.  This is a fast-paced thriller about high-level corporate espionage.  It is representative of his current work, which is half thriller, half satire.  The plot is unrealistic and many of the characters are caricatures, but there is no denying that this is a highly entertaining read with a surprisingly original ending.

In my opinion, Mr. Finder is a really underrated writer.  He wrote several top-notch thrillers in the 1990s, including the novel HIGH CRIMES which was made into a major movie with Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.   Finder then took a hiatus from writing for about six years.  He then remmerged with PARANOIA in 2004, and is now known as a major writer of "corporate" suspense fiction.  His novels are always well done and excellently researched.

If you liked PARANOIA, I strongly recommend Finder's COMPANY MAN, which is my favorite of his books.  You might also want to try Harlan Coben's books, which are somewhat similar in style.  I also believe that the audio versions of Finder's novels, which are read by Scott Brick, are very well done
