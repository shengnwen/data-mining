I thought this book was excellent. As noted in the synopses, black women have been historically ostracized from such mainstream psychological research studies and it only refreshing for this group to finally be addressed, attended to and evaluated by such an intelligent, educated Black women, PhD. Her unprecendented conclusive evalutions provide us with a new voice in the realm of Black, Female Sexuality in a technical, medical and empirical sense, that each of us can identify with. The author, a PhD, also displays the necessary components, (i.e. character, concern for urban society, education, intellect) for a modern day role model. Praise to Dr. Gail Wyatt
