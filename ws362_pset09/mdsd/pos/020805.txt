When the author wrote this book string theory was very "hot"... it has since cooled a lot.
The main problem is that string theory is a limiting "scale".
Physically and geometrically that seems to be just wrong.
This book is somewhat better than the run of the mill Popularization or 
"dumbing down of physics", because he is faithful to history and names specific equations 
 ( mostly without giving them) like the modular functions of Ramanujan.
 I think the author could learn something about this kind of writing from Robert Kanigel ( biographer for Ramanujan).
This author  appears to be a pathological string field theory and superstring physicist in combo of 10 and 26 dimensions.
But he by being faithful to his materials gives even more advanced readers Google searchable names and important papers.
And unlike the Nobel prize winner Steven Weinberg , this author hasn't lost either hope or faith in the future or faith in humanity 
to solve impossible problems. The book has a sense of history and a likable tone of writing
