"The Negotiator" is the first Dee Henderson book I've read.  I've just recently switched to christian fiction and I've got to say this book was very well written and shows a lot of taste.  I've read many books from every genre and the thing that stood out to me the most was her portrayal of all the police, FBI, and U.S. Marshall services working together for the common good.  Most of the cop thrillers I've read show law enforcement in a bad light with fighting in between the agencies.  This was a refreshing change and I found the story went more smoothly with them working together.  The spiritual side of the book was refreshing and well done.  The only thing that left me hanging was . . . What did happen in her childhood??  Anyway, if you like romance, and cops and robbers, I recommend this book to you. I give it an A
