I have read almost every popular book on personal effectiveness and communication including "emotional intelligence," "7 habits," and Cialdini's "influence," and this is the most practical, eye opening, and helpful book I have read since I first read "how to win friends and influence people." 

- Mirroring alone and paying attention to where someone is looking will make you more astute at reading body language. If you don't already mirror people or have been told to mirror but don't know why, this provides some explanation for why it works
- I love the chapter on smiles, I have learned to get a read on someone and their mood by their smile (closed mouth, mouth-only no eyes, or a genuine smile) alone
- The explanation of hand gestures and arm positions is also useful for interpreting people and building rapport
- The description of seating arrangements (sit in a nuetral or cooperative position) has helped me build trust in both professional and personal settings
- A lot of the content is backed up by research studies (such as how people's reduced learning retention when their arms are crossed)
- It is clearly written with a sense of humor

This book will help you sense and understand how people are responding to you
