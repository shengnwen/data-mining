In impressive detail and stylish narrative this "Middle Sea" center of civilization and commerce, democracy and art for at least three millenia, from Homer to the 20th century wars, is written to provide valuable information for the sophisticated student and also an enjoyable meaningful perspective for any 21st century reader. The coverage of events, people and especially conflicts and adventures is outstanding. The prominent author's opinionated statements - Aristotle is provocatively and wrongly called "one of the most reactionary intellectuals - simply reflect the license of fame. In other instances, errors may be the result of the modern pressures to publish in a hurry:  the ancient island of Thera is now called  (the tourists' favorite) Santorini, not, as stated, the other way around; and - glaringly incorrect! - Mytilene is not the original name but just a town on the island known since antiquity (before the word lesbianism was introduced) as Lesbos. Except for these minor questions, this most recent book of the erudite lord Norwich is an outstanding contribution to our understanding of this "cradle" of our civilized worlds.
