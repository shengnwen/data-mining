If you didn't know much about this book before you got it, and simply purchased it because you love Bryson's travel tales, then you were probably dismayed to see it is a tiny book (49 pages) about a trip to one country (Kenya) in Africa. But when you read about the amazing things that the organization named CARE is doing in Africa and know that the money you spent on the book is going to the cause, you will not regret your purchase. Bryson is a keen observer, as always, and honest with what he sees. There is much in Africa to shrink from and fear, but there is much to be proud of and much that can be accomplished. He chronicles children who are intelligent and aspiring but unable to get the full education they need to succeed, women who need small loans in order to ply their trade and support their families, men who, with a meager 4 acres, can grow a lush abundance on their farm with a little instruction, and whole communities who are resurrected with a simple supply of clean drinking water. 

I would like to have read a larger book about more areas of Africa and more of Bryson's adventures, but considering the scope and goal of this book, it is enough
