This book was assigned to me in my British Literature class for a book club.  Shortly after being assigned this book, I quickly went out and began reading it.  While Fielding's writing style does seem to run on a bit, his narrative wit and dialogue is enjoyable.

I found myself liking the three main characters, Parson Adams in particular.  He told some interesting stories, and has kind of an older brother relationship with Joesph, making him a good side character.  The brief moments of action were pretty good in the story, as were the humorous bits.  Its easy to see why this novel will go down as one a classic in literature
