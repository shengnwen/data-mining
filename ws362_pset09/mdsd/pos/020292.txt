First, the few critiques- the historic quotes from famous men on the significance of the Bible contain several which have been shown to be spurious (esp the one attributed to George Washington); the archaeological supports for the Bible are debatable & dated; and the sections on Church History & The Book of Revelation are heavily Protestant, mildly anti-Catholic
(not at Chick or Hislop level) & totally neglects Eastern Orthodoxy.

That said, I prefer it to the NIV updating because an honest Church History has to take a few whacks at Roman Catholicism, and the Revelation commentary blends historical, idealist and futurist views, which I regard as a much fuller perspective than the heavily futurist one in the NIV version. I may get the NIV one to supplement my original Halley's, but I'll always go to the original Halley's in my Bible studies.

Btw, I totally don't know what the racism charge is about.
