Everyone is comparing this follow up novel to "The Three Junes" When a novel is as perfect as that, the follow up is rarely as good. However, I enjoyed this book a great deal.  The characters were genuine and very likable. I found it easy to relate to their stories, dilemmas and decisions. I would definitely recommend it
