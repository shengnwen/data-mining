As a new found Jane Austen fan, I have been reading about everything I can find having to do with her and her works.  My sister made the mistake of lending this book to me and is now having problems getting it back.  Although the plot is somewhat predictable and some of the background characters a bit shallow, the book on the whole is an enjoyable read.  If you are looking for an accurate description of Jane Austen's life, you will be disappointed.  If you want a hold your breath and day dream romance, this book will meet your expectations
