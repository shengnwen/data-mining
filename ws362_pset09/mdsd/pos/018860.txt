On the Road instantly became my favorite book after reading it a short time ago, and of course it prompted me to read more of Kerouac in hopes of attaining that same free spirted prose he is known for.  Lonesome Traveler delivers a much different experience to the reader than does On the Road, but is equally as moving.  The flow of this book can be hard to follow at first, but I found the more I read, the more I began to &quot;be&quot; Kerouac.  Many times I found myself reading a passage over and over again in an attempt to completely and fully understand the feelings and emotions Kerouac is trying to convey.  The end result is a longer read than the number of pages may suggest, but a priceless experience that is rarely found in modern literature
