This was originally written for a magazine in 1941 as novellas, later Heinlein did some revising resulting in this short novel.  This is a quick read and could appeal to the young adult audience as an adventure story but as is often the case with RAH's work, there is far more weight here than the thicknesses of the book would indicate.

The story opens as three young men are exploring their world.  It quickly becomes apparent that they are traveling on a space ship although they do not seem to be aware of this.  Somehow the crew of this ship has forgotten how they got there or where they are going.  One of the young explorers discovers answers, and more questions, in the most unexpected places.

This is very typical of Heinlein's work of the period, the heroes are young men who are questioning the rules of their society.  Their quest causes the reader to in turn examine their own lives and long held beliefs.  The biggest flaw that I see with this work is one that is sadly quite common with RAH's work from this time - he treats women as mere appendages to the men.  There is only one female in the book who has a (minor) speaking role, the others are merely property.
