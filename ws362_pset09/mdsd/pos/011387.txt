Being the "Orientalist" that I am, I simply loved "A Passage to India" E.M Foster does an excellent job on character development and the relationships that build up to fall; then of course, build up again. The entire book is a rollercoaster of friends and foes. The book will keep you puzzled at who really is the antagonist and protagonist of the story.  The book has many symbolic meanings within itself that deal with humanity and conflict in general.

My favorite character in the book was Mr. Fielding. He related to my own character in so many ways. He seemed to be one of the few who wanted to understand the Indians (Muslim and Hindu). 
The book is dealing with the conflict that the British and Indian people had when the British Raj was in power. Looking from both sides of the spectrum, it really exposes the prejudice one had for another. Not only is it a matter of separation in India by the Indian and British, but it also deals with another internal conflict in India with Muslims and Hindus. Truly, it was a divided India.

While sometimes a tedious read, "A Passage to India" plays out to be a very well-written story full of rich history, interesting characters, and very opinionated peoples. This book is highly recommended to anyone who would like to understand some very interesting customs of India. Check it out
