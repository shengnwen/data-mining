I don't usually read fiction, why, maybe it is because much of it plays fast and loose with the facts, yes I know, that is why it is fiction.  Anyway,  I was looking through a book catalog when I saw the title OUR LADY OF THE LOST AND FOUND: A NOVEL.  The descrtiption intrigued me, so I purchased a copy.  This is my first introduction to Diane Schoemperlen.  I liked the style of this book, part diary, part history, and part written meditation on God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Love, Grace, and Faith.  While I thought that the author did go off on tangents once or twice, most notably her chapter on FGM, on the whole this is an almost perfect book, for me.  I liked the story and could identify with the characters.  The main character being, my presumption, a reflection of the author.  Schoemperlen asks the questions of the ages, that have always been asked.  Those times at night, when we wake up and stare at the ceiling.  For a non-Catholic Diane Schoemperlen really has a grasp of what the Virgin Mary means to Catholics and their fellow Christians.  The book is a great little history of Marian visions and Marian devotion.  I consider myself on the conservative side of Catholicism and enjoyed this book immensely.  I can highly recommend it to Catholics and non-Catholics alike who wish to understand the part Mary plays in the life of many Christians.  This is actually 4 1/2 stars.  A definite buy
