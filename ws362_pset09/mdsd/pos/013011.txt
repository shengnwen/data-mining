For a novel without much action, intrigue or romance, "One True Thing" catches your attention and holds it until you turn the last page.  This skillfully woven drama tells of the evolving relationship between a young woman, her ailing mother and emotionally detached father.

Ellen Gulden unwillingly gives up her life and career to return home to look after her mother, and finds that there are many things she never knew about the deceptively strong and proud woman.  During the caring and bonding process, Ellen learns to cook, craft, and generally take over her mother's role in the house, while her cynical and sharp edges are unobtrusively smoothed away.

The death of her mother brings a new set of problems, and while Ellen insists on her innocence, she is accused of a terrible crime. During this trying period, her relationships with the people closest to her change considerably, leading to an unexpected ending.
