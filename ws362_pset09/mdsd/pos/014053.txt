A very good work on the Runes. The only thing that may be a bit troubleing is for one if you are using this as a definite reference point, it can be confusing because she gives multiple meanings of the Runes from different sources. This is actually a good thing, because it helps you understand the full spectrum of commonly held meanings, but again can be confusing for those who see the book as a definite reference point. Yet at the same time she really doesn't acknowledge that Runes themselves are symbols subject to a lot of personal interpretation. However it seems like a great book to use as a standard reference point, it has lot of good references to various lore and such and what amazed me most were the hymns in it. The other thing in the intro where it was condeming racism and such it said "the vikings were not racist... in fact they attacked people of all different ethnicities and took wives from them with equal enthusiasm" or something to that nature. That is not really true. The Vikings for example rarely ever interacted with the native inuit people of Iceland, which they called Skraelings, in fact it was because of their belief in cultural superiority that they failed to adapt some of the natives ways which were better adapted for the cold climate, and thus that is a large reason for the failure of many settlements during cold periods. There are ample records of trade with the middle east, and contact with inuite and such, but none ever of them attacking or taking wives from any of these people. And Vikings were not as war loving as they are made out to be either, typically when they met, for example the middle eastern arabs they traded with them peacefully. I could care less whether you feel this behavior is wrong or correct, but in the least be historically accurate. I hate when people twist facts to suit their personal views, this is called propaganda. Other than that one comment, seems like a great contribution to Asatru
