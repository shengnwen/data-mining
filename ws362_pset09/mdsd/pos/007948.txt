I found this book after getting Jorge Cruise's "3-Hour Diet" book. I wanted to add an easy workout routine to my morning that didn't take as long as a treadmill workout. This fills the bill. What I particularly like is that I don't have to decide which exercises to do in order to work some muscles and let others rest and build tissue. I also didn't have to go out and get extra equipment, since I had a pair of hand weights and that was sufficient to get me started. I may add ankle weights soon, and may need to get heavier hand weights at some point. 

Following the routine in this book, and working with the 3-Hour Diet book, I feel like I'm making better weight loss and fitness progress than I did with another popular diet book.

It's true that the bulk of this work is on weights and not cardiovascular, but he does discuss power walking--it's just not part of the 8-minute morning routine.

My only dissatisfaction with this book is the author's expectation that I write in the book itself to keep track of my progress. That might work for the first month--the number of exercise routines given--but what about those of us who want to keep doing that circuit month after month? I'd rather have a stand-alone notebook to write in and track progress from one cycle to the next
