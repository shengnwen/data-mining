David Mamet here displays the pugnaciousness of a Norman Mailer without the self-embellishing promotionalism.  Speaking for myself, I do not need the names and behaviors of those Jews who fit the ideal type self-abnegator constructed by Mamet.  They are to be found everywhere, including parts of my extended family and even in my own house.  But, unlike Mamet, I don't think Jewish self-hatred is only repulsive.  The true victims of Jewish ambivalence are the descendents of those Jews who internalize the self-mocking, Woody Allenesque gibes of their "wicked son" parents.  They have squandered their own birthright and are too ignorant about its content and value to understand what they've lost. If anything, though he pulls no punches, Mamet does not make the case strongly enough.  But for a solid opening salvo, I'd recommend this book to any disaffected Jew who doesn't at present understand the benefit of "showing up" to lead an obligated Judaic life and helping to make community.
