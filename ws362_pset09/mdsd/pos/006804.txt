Gypsies,(from Egyptians) or the more politically correct ROM or Roma or Romani have been around in Europe especially, have been the rug that you wipe you feet on before going into "Civilized" Eastern Europe. More than any group, except for the American Indians or Indigineous Peoples of Central and South America, the Rom have been looked at as being below contempt.  They are the epitome of dirt, thievery, illiteracy, uncontrolled procreation and uselessness.  

On the scale of untermenschen (underpeople) the Nazis listed them with the mentally and physically handicapped as chronically criminal and not worthy of mention in most of their racial laws. They usually qualified under the catchall 'other'.  They have suffered mostly because they are a 'people' without a history.  Who are they? Where do they come from? What is that language they speak? How are they all related?

Isabel Fonseca spent years with them, learning their customs and language and trying to understand what they are/were.  But even she will admit that it is impossible to understand the Rom unless you are a Rom. You are the ultimate outsider, without an advocate
for your rights of nationality and homeland.  

In 21st century Europe, where most post WWII nations are mostly ethnically homogenized (with almost all Western European nations having non-statistically significant minorities), they still stand out like a sore thumb.  Unlike Turks in Germany, and Arabs in France, what homeland would you repatriate them to? Egypt? India? Persia? if they won't/don't choose to assimilate?

This IS a great sociological study, written with compassion and finese. Read it.
