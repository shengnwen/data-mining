I received this book quickly and was pleased to see the pictures were exactly what I had hoped for and the words were exactly the ones used in the original "Yes, Virginia, There Is A Santa Claus".
  My little 3 year old grandson listened intently as we read it to him.  He wanted to see the pictures as the story was read and explained to him.  This book will become a treasure of our family, to be read and re-read year after year
