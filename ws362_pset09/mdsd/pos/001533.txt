This book is fantastic!  There is so much going on inside this book, you almost need to chart it, and maybe you should if you have an interest in these subjects.  Sure many things seem untenable as they don't fit into our little world concept of should be's, but the unimaginable is only a limit for those who cannot openly think. 
Although we all have a right to our opinions, I wish more people would research and connect ideas, thoughts and facts rather than espouse what they have been told or not researched themselves
