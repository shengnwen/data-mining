I'm a big fan of Mr. Joyce and really enjoy his writing.  I enjoyed just about all of Dark Sister, especially the transformation of Maggie, her kids Amy and Sam and Old Liz.  Old Liz is one of those classic characters everyone has to love and root for!!  My big complaint is Alex, the husband and father.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but felt that a number of his actions were not very belieavable, and also out of character.  It was as of Mr. Joyce needed another "villan" and ended up going over the top with Alex.  But, that's just my opinion.  One other note - I'm not sure I'd classify this as a horror book.  There weren't any scary parts per se, although dealing with witchcraft and the occult could have opened up more opportunities for a darker story.  All in all, Dark Sister was a very quick, very enjoyable read about a number of interesting characters dealing with the subject of witchcraft and how it changes lives
