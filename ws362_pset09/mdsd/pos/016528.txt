The Art and Science of Culinary Preparation is a good book for those  individuals seeking sound basic knowledge about cooking skills. The are a  lot of drawings to aid in understanding the principles discussed.  There  are some nice begining recipes as well.  This makes a nice addition to  anyones library.  This book reminds us of the needed fundamentals we use  every day in cooking.  A very sound value for the money spent.  This book  is the first book we use at my culinary school, and is used in the tests  for certification in the American Culinary Federation tests
