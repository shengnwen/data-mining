Each year I get an updated copy of Novel and Short Story Markets because there are always new opportunities found within its pages. The one thing I wish they would include but haven't yet is the e-book marketplace. Currently it is only if a major publishing house includes e-books among their releases that this shows up. Granted, they have e-zine markets, but I'd like a bit more for e-books. For those not interested in this grantedly small market, the book is an excellent source. I will continue to update my copy each year
