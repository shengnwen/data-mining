The National Museum of Women in the Arts has put together a nice collection of works of art by women artist.  The pictures are clearly photographed including works in all kinds of mediums from drawing to hand crafted items.

I must say I'm quite impressed with the variety of images and ideas placed in this little book. If you're thinking of traveling with it you can carry it in a purse but not in a back pocket.

Frida Kahlo is on the front cover and Mary Cassett is on the back.  Everything from etchings, Tea sets, drawings and paintings have been included in this chronological bouquet of womens work.  If you need to reference works of all kinds of varities of womens works this little book might get you far without costing you a whole lot of money or time referencing different sources.  I really liked it's simple format.
