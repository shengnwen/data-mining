It's a great book, a stunning portrait of the contrast between grandiose ideas and the realities of life in Iraq. The protraits of Iraqi citizens, their perspectives and experiences, is pretty compelling, and great reading.

The more interesting point, reflected in M.D. Livaccari's review, is the way the Right brands all criticism of the Bush administration as "hate." I'm not sure any party in US politics is ready to face facts, no matter where the chips fall, but conservative Republicans seem to have an outright aversion to facing unpleasant truths. Packer forthrightly says he was highly sympathetic to the aims of the war... Any ordinary business person can grasp the foolishness of poor planning behind a massive "product launch," and would hold executive staff accountable for the product's failure in the marketplace without adequate product design, research, marketing support, service and support staff, etc. Why is the Bush Administration exempt from these principles
