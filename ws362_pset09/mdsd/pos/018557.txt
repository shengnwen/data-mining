This book is more of an adventure story than it is a mystery.  Although it gets a bit slow in the middle, it still is pretty good.  Amelia and Emerson are wonderful as usual in this.  The thing I really like about these stories is the way these two complement each other when they are solving their mysteries or pursuing their adventures together.  In this book, we see Amelia and Emerson as well as their son Ramses on a wild hunt through the desert.  They are going to find out what happened to a friend of Emerson's that disappeared with his wife about 10 years ago.  Everyone thought they had died, but his father is sure that he's alive.  The humour is just as apparent in this book as in others, and the story is fun.  Amelia and her family are placed in danger again, but they manage to overcome as usual.  This was not my favourite Peabody mystery, if only because I had figured out the plot twists and turns before they happened, but it's still fun nevertheless
