This book reveals many answers to the questions even I asked when I started my career in cartooning. The interviews and thoughts, efforts put in to this book is one reason why even after 16 years as a cartoonist I still enjoy being able to read through this book and get something out of it every time. This isn't just for those starting out, it's also a reminder for those in the industry.
