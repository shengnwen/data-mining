The first Repairman Jack novel by F. Paul Wilson was written in 1984; the character would lie fallow for quite a while till the late 1990s, when Wilson started producing the Repairman Jack books on a more regular basis.  That first book was called The Tomb, and while a good book, actually had nothing at all to do with a tomb.  In contrast, the second book in the series, Legacies, has a lot to do with legacies.

In particular, the legacy in this story is a house belonging to the late Ronald Clayton - a brilliant scientist but generally unpleasant guy - and has been willed to his daughter Alicia.  Alicia, a doctor at a children's AIDS clinic, despised her father and would normally want nothing to do with the house.  When her brother Thomas, a loser who can hardly earn a living (and was cut out of the will), offers her a huge sum for the house, she resists, sensing something fishy.  Her brother then contests the will, and the people she turns to for help wind up dead.

After Jack does her a favor by retrieving some toys stolen from the clinic, Alicia tries to get his assistance.  Initially reluctant, he eventually decides to help.  It is apparent that there is something in the house that someone wants, and Jack wants to find it first.  He also needs to know who is backing Thomas with a lot of funds.  

Unlike many other Wilson books, this is a nonsupernatural story, but there is still some out-of-the-ordinary stuff going on.  In addition, we get a good amount of the suspense and action that Wilson does well.  On the other hand, there are times in the book that rescues come from out of nowhere which cheapens some of the story.  Generally, Wilson is a dependable writer of four star books, and I'll give this one such a rating, but it is a little weaker than his other works.
