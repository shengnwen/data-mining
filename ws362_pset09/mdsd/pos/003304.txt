The medical profession, for much of its lifetime, has been shrouded in mystery. For many, the words and judgements of a doctor seem infallible, which is why there is often such incredulity associated with mistakes.

In Atul Gawunde's book, we get a behind the scenes look at his life as a resident in Internal Medicine and some of the truths that people must accept take place when they enter a hospital. What amazes me most about Gawunde's writing is his use of anecdotes to perpetuate his arguments and ideas. His experiences have been so rich and varied that he is able to draw upon so many fascinating cases to highlight some of the great and some of the not so great aspects of medicine and of learning to be a physician. Anyone who would like to be a doctor - and especially those who want to go into any surgical field - will benefit from this open and honest account of what it truly means to be a doctor.
