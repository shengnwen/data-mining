I enjoyed this as well as the other Gentry Novels, however, it dragged on a bit too long.  Some of the story lines from the past book was just left off completely.  I was expecting them to pick up in this book, but instead whole new concepts were introduced making the whole sega confusing.  I understand the next book (Minstrel's Kiss) is pretty much a repeat of Stroke, so not looking forward to it, but I'm going to read it just the same.  I'm ready for Meredith to finally resolve a few things, then move on, and then get into some new and exciting action!!
