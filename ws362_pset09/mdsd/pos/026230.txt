          Brian's winter by Gary Paulsen is great, suspenseful, intense, and enjoyable book.  It is an awesome book especially if you like adventurous or survival books.  In this book Brian endures many animals such as a skunk who he becomes very fond of her and names her Betty he also comes to face with wolves, deer, and the most dangerous one of them all a moose which attacked him during his hunt.  Brian uses his knowledge of the wilderness to survive.  He also uses his memories too help design bows, arrows, and even arrowheads.  He got used too living in the wilderness so he worked on new hunting techniques.  He also learned how too make his shelter more secure by packing the walls with mud making it water tight and nearly air tight.  This is a great sequel to the book Hatchet.  Brian is a great character considering he gives the book a lot of suspense.  During the time Brian was in the woods he learned many useful things such as how to carve an animal which is a good thing considering he as improved his hunting skills.  The book Brian's winter was a great book I would definitely recommend it to anyone who liked Hatchet or likes adventurous or survival books.
