Thanks to AMAZON'S recommended books and reviews, I discovered this delightful series.  Elizabeth Peters does a wonderful job combining mystery, history and archeology into a fast paced story that entertains the reader.  Then of course we can't forget the romance (implied, naturally).  
In my opinion, THE LAST CAMEL DIED AT NOON is the best of the first six books in the series (the first one did get me hooked).  The concept of finding a lost city hidden in the middle of the desert was brilliant.  We are also introduced to Nefret who not only becomes the Emerson's adopted daughter but an integral part of the rest of the Peabody series.
And, I am absolutely thrilled to discover a series of books where there are at least 20 already written.  I don't have to wait for the next one; I can just go straight through!
