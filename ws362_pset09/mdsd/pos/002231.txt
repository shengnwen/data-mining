I found this book while writing a term paper on the impact of spices. Spice: THoaT stands out among both popular and academic style books on spices with its colourful diction, its intense focus and most of all with its exhaustive research. Turner's bibliography was just as helpful as his other content. For the majority of readers, those who aren't doing research, I still recommend it heartily. Spices are absolutely fascinating, and Turner chows down on their history without using phrases like I have in the title of this review. Another strong work in the same vein is Nathaniel's Nutmeg by Giles Milton. Unlike THoaT, NN has a central story and a narrow focus, but it covers similar ground  and is also a good read. I got an A on my paper, and Spice: The History of a Temptation gets an A+. Turner is thorough in his research, and deft in his presentation.
