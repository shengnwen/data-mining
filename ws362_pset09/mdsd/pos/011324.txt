I found &quot;Boost Your Interview IQ&quot; to be completely different from other advice books on landing a job in that it tells you specifically how to answer all the possible questions you'll be asked. It covers 50 of the most commonly asked interview questions, including, &quot;Why were you fired?&quot;, &quot;Why have you been out of work for so long?&quot;, and just about every other potential question you can think of. The book gives three potential answers for each question, ranks each on a strong, mediocre, or weak scale, and explains why the answers rank the way they do. I'm an author (Never Be Late Again, 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged), and when I'm finished promoting my book, I'll be rejoining the workforce. This book will be my constant companion.  Great book
