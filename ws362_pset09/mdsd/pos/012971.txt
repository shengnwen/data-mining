Agree or disagree, this book takes you through all the madness of politics since the rise of Clinton - yes, Clinton.  Though Hightower is a populist liberal, he takes Clinton to task for being complicit in the gradual decline of the people's voice in government, bowing instead to corporate interests who want everything from tax-deductible CEO salaries (ever wonder why they were so high?) to looser regulations on the food we eat (recent food poisoning cases come to mind).  If you're a Republican, you can't blame this book on a Bush-bashing mentality.  Democrats have their problems too
