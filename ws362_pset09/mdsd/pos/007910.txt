This book has a tightly woven intricate plot and wonderful characters. The action starts when Chaz Perrone throws his wife Joey off a cruise liner on their anniversary. Chaz is your basic hapless idiot - he can't do anything right. Joey makes it to a tiny island where an ex-cop named Stanahan nurses her back to health and then agrees to help her get revenge on her husband. The twists and turns of the plot are great, but the characters are better. Some moments are hilarious - especially whenever Chaz tries to accomplish something. There are some nasty characters and some gutsy characters and some smart characters and some dumb ones and then there are the crazies. Chaz is really reprehensible, but I actually felt sorry for him by the end.

I don't think I can say much about the story without giving things away, so just read it - you won't be disappointed
