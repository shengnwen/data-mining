I've been waiting a long time to read a piece of non-fiction that is as beautifully written as this book is.  It is as if Baudrillard traveled to the future, read the first great 21st Century novel and retold the story except that he completely forgot the narrative, and left us with only the protagonist's thoughts.  Sure he missteps a couple of times and you're left with the impression by the end of certain paragraphs that instead of offering the reader a real observation Baudrillard has merely circumnavigated the semblance of one, but where else have you read a thinker as ambitious as to try to convey in such an intimate manner a critique of a culture that doesn't relate to each individual directly as much as it exchanges symbols of communication.  I give this book 4 stars as a first time read due to some of its thornier prose, but I'm sure that as the reader returns to this book he or she will become convinced that it is truly a 5 star achievment
