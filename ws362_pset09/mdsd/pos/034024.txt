If you are looking for a different type of Christmas story for your children this season, I highly recommend this one.  A friend from Australia sent this to my son and we absolutely love it.   It has a sing-songy verse, adorable illustrations, and a beautiful story-line that is just not your "standard" Christmas story.  Poor Wombat desperately wants to be a part of the Nativity play, but there is just no part he is suited for - except - the most important part of all!  I'm buying several copies of this book to give as gifts.  Get a copy for yourself - you will love it
