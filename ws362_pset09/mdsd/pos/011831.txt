This story, peopled by a truckload of the kind of quirky, vivid characters that are Anne Tyler's specialty, is a gem. Obviously, many people have a negative first reaction to the idea that a woman could simply walk away from her life, leaving husband, children, and sibs behind.  But this is the genius of Tyler's writing. She spins a tale that almost borders on allegory.  It is a wonderful world of "what if."  What if I just took a walk down the beach and kept walking? How would I survive? Where would I go? What would I do?  Do these people really need me at all?  

Tyler's creation of Delia's alter-ego, Miss Grinstead, is inspired.  The notion of starting over, tabula rasa, is magic and sets the imagination in motion. The bare room, the careful meals of vegetable soup and yogurt, the tiny purchases that Delia makes with such introspection, and her hunger to keep things simple set a great stage for building the rest of the story.  Tyler sets it up like a castle of Lincoln Logs, one wonderful piece at a time. As new people enter Delia's life, the complexities of just being alive on the planet come wandering back in, because that is just the way life works!

The story does end a bit abruptly, or perhaps it only seems that way because the reader is left to wonder what becomes of all those new people in Delia's life. But really, that is ALSO how life works; things are rarely if ever wrapped up in a neat package, in the final analysis.

Let your imagination off its leash for a while and take a climb on the Ladder of Years.
