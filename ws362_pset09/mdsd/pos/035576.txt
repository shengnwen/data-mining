Yet more proof that I shouldn't judge a novelist by the movies. I hated Jurassic Park, I read about the sequel at The Agony Booth, and Congo didn't impress me. 

Last year, a friend recommended Sphere to me. I vaguely remembered reading and enjoying it as a security guard 20 years ago. Meanwhile, I could remember none of it, which is the usual fate of anything I read when I was a security guard 20 years ago. I reread Sphere here in China and enjoyed it greatly. 

In TIMELINE, some modern folks go back to 14th century France, and I've never seen such a premise executed so well. And yes, I have read Neal Stephenson. The science and the history in Timeline are meticulously researched, and Crichton does a fantastic job of bringing it all to life. Take a look at all the gushing reviews if the mood strikes you. It's even better than they say.
