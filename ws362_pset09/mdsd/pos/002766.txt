As an engineer for several years, but new to telecom, this book has been a wonderful reference.  For one reason, acronyms, for another, descriptions.  People around me and the technical literature constantly express acronyms.  I reach for the book and not only do I find the acronym's definition, but also a paragraph or more to describe it.  If you want in depth descriptions, you must go elsewhere.  I refer to this book at least once daily
