Mill meets his opening promise to track his astounding and slightly disturbing early education, moral/intellectual development, and allotment of credit to those who shaped his ideas.  Mill chooses not to share many  narrative details of his colorful life, but instead focuses on the plethora  of theories that shaped one of the greatest minds of his century. At times  references to obscure works or persons can be tiresome as he &quot;gives  credit&quot; to them.  Mill's relationhsips with his wife and father and  his embracing of poetry after a corrosively reasoned childhood education  are the most fascinating facets of the work
