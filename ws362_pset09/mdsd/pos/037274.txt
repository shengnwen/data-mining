I don't know why I waited so long to read this stellar collection.  I agree with the other reviewers--the very best selections might be "Flowers in the Dustbin" and "Grog" and "Poison in the Human Machine," and of course the title story, but they're all good with moments or lines that are amazing.  There is geniune emotion in Nissen's stories, and geniune insight in girls growing up, which is what I look for and hope for but rarely ever find.  I haven't enjoyed a book so much since Jennifer Paddock's novel, A SECRET WORD, came out in the spring.  It's that good!  I couldn't recommend OUT OF THE GIRLS' ROOM AND INTO THE NIGHT more highly
