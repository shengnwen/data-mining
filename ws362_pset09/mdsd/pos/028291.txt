This was absolutely the BEST book I have ever read regarding the history of the conflict in Israel.  I had been unable to find books about the early history of the area that didn't seem biased toward one point of view or the other. STRUGGLE FOR THE HOLY LAND provides a point of intersection in which the interests and aspirations of each side are carefully evaluated. William Hare is truly a talented author with a gift for presenting complex historical events in a way that even the non-history buff can understand and enjoy.  Your only disappointment will be when there are no more pages to read! A rare find
