        My name is  Christian  I.   Sanchez    and    I   am   8    years  old .     My  English   teacher  read  this  book  to   us  in  class  and   I  thought    It  was a    funny  book   My  favorite  part  was  when  the  pigeon  is   eating  the hot  dog.   I   recommend  this   book   for  the  whole   family.   I   also like   this  book by Carl Reiner:   Tell  me  a  scary   story  but not too scary.   I   hope you  like   it   too
