An intoxicating blend of literary and genre fiction from Roald Dahl.  I'll be buying volume 2 on the strength of volume one.  I read "Man From The South" nearly twenty years ago and have never forgotten it.  Imagine a master storyteller relating a hair raising tale in very calm and matter of fact tones and you get a good idea of Dahl's "voice".  The most fantastic premise seems plausible when Dahl is relating the details.  "Georgy Porgy" is phenomenal, as is "The Sound Machine".  "William and Mary" is another eye opener (read it, then excuse my pun).  If you think Dahl is a "children's author", think again.  Highly recommended
