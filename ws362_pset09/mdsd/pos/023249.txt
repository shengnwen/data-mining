My daughter picked up a Lab/bulldog mix puppy thrown out at a park. His health is not the best to say the least. While searching for  a non-steroid solution to his skin allergy rash, I stumbled across references to Ms. Levy's book. This  book, along with another by Pitcairn have saved this puppy from dying. An added benefit has been that my Cocker and Dachshund have improved as well. The Cocker is now 13 years old and I had accepted her slowing down and lethatgy to her age. Now that she is eating naturally she has energy that I haven't seen in years. The nicest effect is that she no longer smells horrible and her eyes no longer water and leave stains under her eyes! The book is written so that it is easy for anyone to understand. I am highly recommending this book to all. I think it should be required reading for veterinary students as well
