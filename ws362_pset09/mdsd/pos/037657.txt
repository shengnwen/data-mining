An excellent story of a couple living out their dreams in the beautiful Rhone Valley of France. Mayle fills "A Year in Provence" with his own witty accounts of exursions to near by villages and remodeling a 200-year-old farm farmhouse.  The couples daily life is described in great detail, highlighting their delectible French meals.  A true joy from begining to end
