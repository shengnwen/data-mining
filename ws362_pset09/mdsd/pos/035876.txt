Very good plot - early Nora and the sequel to Sacred Sins.  Not knowing that, I read this one first.  The characters of Ed Jackson, Ben Paris, and Tess Court return.  Ed and Ben are Detectives with the Washington, DC police department, out to find the killer of Grace McCabe's (noted murder mystery writer) sister, Kathleen Breezewood, as well as others that follow.  The story focuses on the search for the serial killer and an insight into the workings of Fantasy, Inc., a phone service for lonely people.  The killer's trademark - strangulation by telephone cord (could this be a connection?).  The story is excellent and the mystery of it all will keep you reading.
