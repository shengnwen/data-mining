Nice coffee-table companion to the 00's greatest sitcom containing interviews, episode guide, trivia etc.

However, although what material there is is good, since it is *impossible* for an aficionado to know too much about their favourite TV show, I reckon there should have been more information fitted in.  For instance, we are told that 10 episodes of 'Curb' take six months to shoot and six to edit but actual production dates for the five seasons would have been nice.  

Also, we only get short extracts from Larry David's original episode outlines -- would have loved to read at least one in full. (For comparison purposes, these extracts are followed by transcripts of the actual scenes which resulted -- wonderful though it is, 'Curb's' dialogue just doesn't suit being written down!).

If you're a fan ('Curb-crawler'?!), or interested in the show, the book is heartily recommended.  It's definitely good stuff, but left me wanting more
