Okay, I suppose I can't write anything here that will have more impact than the book cover: "Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature". It deserves it. I've read a lot of good books-- even a few great ones-- but this is the best. If I ever read something better, maybe I'll come back and change what I said, but I don't think it's going to happen. 

I won't give a synopsis of the story. Read the other reviews for that. I'm saying this book is simply monumental. Ingest it if you can, because it's not a Sunday afternoon read. As you go, you'll find it makes you think. 

Think about the scope of tragedy that was Western civilization in the first half of the 20th century. Think about... well, you should read it, and think for yourself. It will not leave you indifferent
