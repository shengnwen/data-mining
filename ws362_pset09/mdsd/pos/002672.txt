This book was absolutely fabulous.  It gives information about the most popular breeds that compete in saddelseat equitation, and Helen Crabtree is especcially helpful with all of her years of experience.  Even though the book is more than 20 years old, the lessons inside remain true.  This is a timeless book that should be read by all saddleseat riders to enhance their possible performance in and out of the show ring
