A resourceful, wealthy mouse shows that even the pampered can muster up some chutzpah when they have to.

The writing about nature and the seasons reminded me of  E.B. White. When Abel was holed up in his log during the long, snowy winter, I wanted to be with him, reading a book. I loved the gruff yet charming frog named Gower, with his reptilian trances.

My boys, ages 7 and 9, liked the book too. Steig makes good use of the great wealth that is English. To me, he's right up there with White and Arnold Lobel and Doris Burn (who wrote The Summerfolk)
