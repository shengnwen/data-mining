"A Year of Impossible Goodbyes" by Sook Nyul Choi is about a young and her family being over run by the Japanese during WWII in 1945.At the time the girl lived in Pyongyang. Later, after the war and after the Japanese left the Russians, they came and took over. This book was very over whelming. The narrator put so much detail into it and its like you are Sookan. You can actually feel the sorrow and excitement in the book
