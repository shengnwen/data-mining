Don't let the subtitle's insinuated man-bashing alienate you from reading this wonderful book.  I decided to order this book because of the good reviews, and I am so glad I did!  The subtitle threw me off at first, because though humorous, it made me suspect that the gist of the book would be about men being intolerable.  Quite the contrary, the author's recounting of love stories, both with people and with animals, are indeed loving, and also thoughtful, humorous, and engaging.  The book spans several decades of her life, and all the way through, her voice is fresh, her writing clever, her tales intriguing. I read a LOT of books, and this is one of my all time favorites.  Her interests vary from reading and writing, to pets and wild animals, from sports and running, to bad TV shows and junk food... and the way she weaves it all into beautiful prose and a continuous story line is mighty impressive.  Indeed there is something here for every reader to relate to!  After reading this book, I desperately want to read MORE from this author... heck, I want to be FRIENDS with this woman!  For the first time ever, after reading this book, I ordered several more to give away to friends... that's how much I enjoyed it, how worth it the book is, and how confident I am that anyone else should love it at least half as much as I did - and that would be plenty!  ENJOY!
