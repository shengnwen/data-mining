Secrets of the ZONA ROSA  has changed my life dramatically.  I learned about it from a long-time friend and bought it thinking it would be a good book to have, not knowing I wouldn't be able to put it down once I started reading it.  It soothed an ache, touched a cord, resonated deeply, jump started my confidence, cut through the myths ... all cliches, but all true.  Ms Daniell is an amazing mentor.  With this book she not only teaches, but inspires through writing and encouragement.  I bought fifteen copies to give to my girlfriends with a few extra for `emergencies,' one of which has already been utilized.  I highly recommend keeping one available at all times.  You never know when you'll be needing an exorcise.
