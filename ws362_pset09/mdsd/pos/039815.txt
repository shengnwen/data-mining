I borrowed this book from a public library before purchasing it. What I liked about the book was the art work included, the narration style, the stories about the source of the recipes, the diversity of the recipes. I have tried a few of the recipes from this book, I liked some of them but would not care to make the others a second time. I also liked that the author suggested locally available ingredients as substitutions.  All in all, I did like the book enough to buy it after I had looked through it.
