This complicated,work so full of ambiguity and difficulty in language and style is one I have found almost unreadable. The broad spaces and the great ranging adventurous mind of Melville in Moby Dick(The work which preceded this and in which all of Melville's writing climaxed) is followed by a claustrophic, domestic drama which seems to go nowhere. 
My sense many other people have a more generous attitude towards this work, than I do and understand it more deeply. 
As my old high- school Physics teacher Dave Levenstein ( of blessed memory) said when asked about the Theory of Relativitiy- 
"I read some of that Einstein stuff and I just didn't get it."  In regard to 'Pierre" I too "just didn't get it.
