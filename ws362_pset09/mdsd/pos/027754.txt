I already own her book, "Ethnic Interiors" and love it.  I ordered this book online thinking it would be just as good.  But it's actually the exact same book with a different cover.  No kidding!  I have no idea why she'd release the two books with different covers but identical content, but that's what's happened here.  The content is wonderful.  I wrote a great Amazon review of for the other book, which I won't repeat here.  But I'm terribly disappointed that no one has bothered to mention in the item description that the two books are the same.  I guess I'll be passing this book on as a gift
