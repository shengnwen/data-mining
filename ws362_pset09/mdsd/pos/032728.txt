After authoring two memorable non-fiction books on spiritual warfare, Tom Horn unites with his wife Nita, exploding on the fictional scene with the haunting and powerful The Ahriman Gate.

I commend Tom for what he was trying to accomplish with Ahriman: that is, through the use of a fictional story, to introduce the reader to the frightening recent developments within the world of transgenetics, biotechnology, and nanotechnology through a Christian worldview. This worldview holds that the inspired Word of God should be used as a framework and foundation to understanding the past as well as what is to come.

There is no more desirable result than to have the reader understand the sordid world of transgenetics through the lens of God's Word. Throughout the dialogue in the story, many important topics are breached which will normally not be touched in the pulpit, such as:
*	Nephilim - What lessons can be learned about the offspring of the fallen angels and human women?
*	Transmogrification - The ability of angels to manipulate matter and energy, and to shapeshift into human form.
*	Aliens - Is there life on other planets, or are these "visitors" simply the Biblical fallen angels and evil spirits masquerading as "grays?"
*	Alien abductions - Do victims of abductions actually physically experience what they describe in abduction accounts, or are they the unwitting pawns of evil spirits who, through remote viewing, implant thoughts, images, and experiences into their minds?
*	The stones of fire - What was the Lord referring to in Ezekiel chapter 28 when he said Lucifer was moving about in the "stones of fire?"

Those who have read Tom's previous books on evil spirits and spiritual warfare know that he is an expert in the field. He deftly incorporates this knowledge throughout The Ahriman Gate to explain what the characters were experiencing and the entities with whom they were engaging.

I highly recommend all of Tom Horn's work: the non-fiction Spiritual Warfare: The Invisible Invasion and The Gods Who Walk Among Us, and now the fictional title The Ahriman Gate.
