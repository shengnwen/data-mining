On The Devil's Court

There are two things that Joe Faust is ashamed of: selling his soul to the devil and going to private school. Joe is the son of an award winning scientist.   He is a great basketball player who can't test his ability because he constantly plays against the private school students.  With his father around, basketball is not a main priority for the family except for his mom who is a sculptor.  When Joe finds himself practicing in a dirty, lightless, and rundown gym, he finds that he seems to feel the devil creeping and lurking around him in the mist as he shoots.  Joe carefully speaks aloud, "Give me a full season of power and in return my soul is yours."
The author Carl Dueker did a fantastic job of describing the surroundings in the story, from the crazy fans to the quiet household of the Faust family.  He detailed everything.  This is one of the best books I've ever read and that Carl Dueker has written.  I'd recommend this book to kids who like basketball and a good story to follow.  I scored with this great book and you should to.
