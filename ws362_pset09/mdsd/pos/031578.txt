Excuse me as I let "Little Johnny"...my five year old inner child review this book...

Hi. I loved this book. This book was great. This book made me laugh. I liked Max. I liked Max and how he put on a wolf suit. Max was funny when he went to the Island of the Monsters. My favorite monster was the one with the horns. I liked the drawings. I liked the story. I thought it was really, really good. Can I have some ice cream now?

Thanks "Little Johnny" and yes, you may have some ice cream, just save some for me.

As you can see by "Little Johnny's" review, the book is absolutely great and he's right. I think that this book is in its 9 millionth printing. It's the kind of book that will never age. Everything else will, but this book will always stay the same. I remember wanting to be able to draw just like Maurice Sendak. My mom said that she sent a few of them to him to Mr. Sendak, but he never replied, so if you are reading this Mr. Sendak, uh, could you look in your pile of fan mail and see if you have a large yellow manilla envelope that's postdated from 1969? My pictures are in there...by the way, my "Inner Child" says, "Hi"...

There are a few things that I hope I never get tired of (1) Being able to feel the Presence of Love around me and within me, (2) Being able to laugh at myself and (3) Maurice Sendak's, Where the Wild Things Are. It's just a wonderful snapshot of my childhood that brings me pleasure every time I read it.

Time for some ice cream, that is, if "Little Johnny" saved me some. The last few times he didn't. Oh, well...kids will be kids...

Peace and Blessings
