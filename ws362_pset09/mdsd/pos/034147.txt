Highly enjoyable and eminently readable.  The suspense built at a perfect pace and the main character was extremely likable.  I love Gaylin's style.  There were a few metaphors that made me laugh out loud.  It was a true page-turner.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars is that I wish children hadn't been tortured and killed in the book.  It's too uncomfortable to read about.  I'd rather only adults be killed
