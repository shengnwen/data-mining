Compelling story of the USS Indianapolis, the ship that carried the atomic bomb to Tinian. On their way back from their mission, they are attacked by the Japanese, and the ship sinks. No one knows where they are, and they are not listed as being out--they are floating in the open sea, and fall prey to sharks, and in some cases, their own madness. Only 317 crew members were alive at the end of their five day ordeal.

It's a book of courage, and a testament to the sailors. It's also a damming account of the ineptness of the US Navy in the worst naval disaster in US history
