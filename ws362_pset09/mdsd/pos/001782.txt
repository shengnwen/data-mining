Harrison Owen describes leadership as a capacity within each of us.  He builds on his concepts of &quot;Open Space Technology&quot; by focusing on leadership as helping people see possibilities on a large scale rather than  focussing on the minute.  Storytelling plays a significant role with  Harrison on leadership.  One must remain true to the spirit of founders yet  translate that to current situations.  His thoery blends nicely with  concepts put forth by Ronald Heifetz and Marsha Sinetar
