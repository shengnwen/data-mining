4+ months after ordering this book in a fit of insomnia, I finally finished it.  This thorough treatise covered so much that if often put me to sleep.   The book contains a lot of great information if you can stay with it too the end. 

Dr. Dement is a pioneer in the field and he describes how he jumped into the field and shares many stories about sleep experiments and science.  His writing style makes complex explanations of the science of sleep easy for a lay person to understand. 

Unfortunately, Dr. Dement's passtion for this area results in an unnecessarily long book.  He repeats certain types of information through out the book. By the end, I was mumbling to myself.  "I got it, I got. Dr's ignore sleep problems. There's not enough funding.  Alerting and circadian rhythms affect our ability to fall asleep." 

That being said, I learned a lot from this book and am glad I finished it.  I have implemented a few core recommendations and have improved my sleep.  I just hope that if another edition is published it is edited done to a more maneagable size.
