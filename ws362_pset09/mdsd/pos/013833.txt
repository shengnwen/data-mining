My 4 year old son loves this book.  We first learned of the book in his preschool.  He came home one day and talked about this book all afternoon. The next day we checked it out at the library and liked it a lot. The book is very creative and colorful which captures a young child's attention.  There are so many different items that we could identify and learn. My son  wants me to read this book many times throughout the day and frequently  asks when it is going to snow. This is a great book by Lois Ehlert
