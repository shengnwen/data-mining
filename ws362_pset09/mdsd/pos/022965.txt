This book is sort of betwixt and between. It's trying to be a layman's guide to the physiology and psychology of stress, and it does a good job, but you'll need to dig out some of your high school biology to understand it.

Sapolsky clearly understands the subject very well, and he writes well, but there's really no way to minimize the complexity of stress physiology. So buy the book, by all means, but don't expect to breeze through it like a typical self-help book
