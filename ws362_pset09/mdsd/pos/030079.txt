This was an ambitious first book by Eric Wilson.  Dark to Mortal Eyes is the first book in the senses series, which explores the five senses.  Obviously by the title, this one was about sight.  It has a complex, intriguing plot some of which ties into his second book Expiration Date.  Wilson does a great job of creating very vivid, supernatural visualizations.  My extreme phobia of snakes was really challenged.  Since I enjoy books with historical aspects, the inclusion of World War II and Russian artifacts were a nice bonus.  This book dives into the depths of revenge and the striving for redemption.  The different plots come together nicely in the end, but also leaves a few lingering questions to be answered in subsequent books.  It is obvious a lot of work was put into this book.  Setting up the complex plot takes a while, so the book feels slow at the beginning.  Give it time, because once it starts moving it goes fast and is a very enjoyable read
