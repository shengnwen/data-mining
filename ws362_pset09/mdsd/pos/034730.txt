Though I read this book two years ago I will never forget it. Cynthia brings the reader through all her hardships. At times it seems like she will never get better and that the eating disorder will take her life. However, no matter how sick she is, there is always a hint of hope. Slowly, after years of being sick with anorexia and bulimia, you see her begin the slow, painful process of recovery. Her life, little by little, begins to piece itself somewhat into normalcy. Eventually she is fully recovered and happy about it. This book brings what most other books on eating disorders do not; a happy ending. I recommend it highly
