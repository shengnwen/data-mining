This is THE book to search out regarding the World Trade Center!It reads like a great mystery, and though we all know the ending, I could not put this book down.Anyone who has ever made the statement that &quot;engineers can't write&quot; needs to rid themselves of that notion. Mr. Koch's style is fantastic. I truly felt at times that I was at the job site along with him. The technical details were explained so that anyone could understand. The section regarding the&quot;kangaroo&quot; cranes was amazing.I truly enjoyed this book from start to finish, and I hope Mr. Koch will provide more for us to read. The only problem I have with this book is that I believe it probably got lost in the maze of post 9-11 books! That is a shame, because this is great writing that should have a wide audience
