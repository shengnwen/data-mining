I really liked "Belle Ruin."  It was the first I read of the Emma Graham books.  Steven King says the willing suspension of disbelief is a clean and jerk. (I'm remembering, not quoting SK) Once you get the weight over your head, you can hold it easily, unless something knocks it down.  I found Emma took a bit of effort and a couple of failures to lift, but I finally got her willingly suspended and then I loved her.
Ms. Grimes has always been tempted to the mystical/paranormal/occult but this side of fantasy.  I think with Emma she has found a voice for this side of her writer's mind
