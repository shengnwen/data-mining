Saying that this book is merely great somehow falls short of telling the full story.  You see, this book is utterly essential--essential, that is, if you have any desire to glimpse the real meaning of what art is and how it comes to be.  This book is joyful, yet completely sensible; spiritual yet fully earthbound.  Though nearly a century old, every word in The Art Spirit is relevant today, perhaps more so than ever!  I have bought several copies of this book and make a practice of loaning them out when finished, asking each &quot;borrower&quot; to pass it along rather than return it to me.  A book like this should never sit closed on a shelf
