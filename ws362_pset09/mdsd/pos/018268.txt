It has been said that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.  Now it would appear the same can be said about science.  A previous review was entitled "This is not science."  I suggest reading the book anyway and drawing your own conclusion.  Make no mistake, the orthodox scientific community is out to get William Dembski because his work is so good.  It is empirically based.  It is theoretically sound.  And it is infinitely more plausible than the best theories the orthodox community has to offer.  And they hate it when Occam's razor is turned against them.  Is it science?  Well, not according to them.  

The unfortunate truth is that Intelligent Design theory has become so politicized, many reviews here are authored by those who oppose the concept, but have not read the book.  They seek to intellectually excommunicate ID's proponents, to destroy Dembski's credibility.  But as one of them points out, the truth is not easily dismissed. 

My brother holds a PhD in Math and is a respected university professor (no intellectual lightweight).  And his worldview is such that he would be predisposed to disagree with Dembski.  His reaction to reading this book: it is well-written and the concepts proposed, namely irreducible complexity and specified complexity, are compelling.  

So, I suggest that, unless you suffer from intellectual prejudice, you will find this book a very worthwhile read.   

I would have given the book 5 stars, but I found some of Dembski's overtly Christian references unnecessary and detracted from the book's overall credibility.  Although I did enjoy the Homer Simpson analogy
