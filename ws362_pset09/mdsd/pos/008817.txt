Let me make things clear early in this review. I think this is a great book, but most people who aren't professional cooks will have trouble preparing the recipes verbatim. That's part of why I say it's a great coffee table book. 

The other reason I deem it to the den is that it has some great reading that isn't solely about food preparation, rather stories about suppliers of meats and vegetables that Keller uses in his world famous kitchen. 

I'm a pretty experienced cook (not chef) and I've cooked about 5 recipes in this book. What I've chosen to do is take certain parts of a recipe and focus on that or use techniques that he recommends and use them to embellish dishes. For instance, he gives a great explanation on getting pan seared fish skin really crispy that has suited me very well. Also, I've used his technique for liver and onions to spruce up my version.

One recipe that is not very difficult, and adds a new twist to a rib-eye steak is the "Yabba Dabba Doo". I highly recommend the novice chef to try that one, since it takes the familiar and (excuse the banality) "kicks it up another notch".

In summation: if you like to peruse wonderful pictures and read about the nuances of food preparation, this is the book for you. If you're a novice chef that wants to emulate Keller's dishes in a sinch, forget about it. Put the $40 or so dollars towards his other book, Bouchon, which is much more approachable and just as good. The recipes are "bistro style" (i.e. they don't involve 5 people working on them simultaneously and an MFA in food artistry) like his haute cuisine at the Laundry
