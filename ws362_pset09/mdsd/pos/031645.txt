I thought this was a pretty  good book, but when they fight over who gets to baby sit Lucy Newton that's what I didn't like about it. I thought Mary Ann had good judgement When Jenny got sick. Also I thought it was pretty cool when Mary Ann tried to get her friends back together, and made a new friend in the process
