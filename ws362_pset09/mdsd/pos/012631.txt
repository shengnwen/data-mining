This book is a bit overrated, I feel. However, that is not to say it is bad: it isn't. It is a bit inconsistent, though. Naipaul will have ten or twenty pedestrian pages followed by a truly first-rate passage. It is a straightforward tale of a young Indian man who runs a shop in an unnamed African country (narrated in the first person), and the events that befall him over a period of about ten years. The portrayal of Africans is brutally honest, and bien-pensants will have their sensibilities offended. But fair-minded, realistic folks will perhaps gain a better understanding of why things in Africa are worse, not better, than they were when the colonists left, and what it will take before that continent (mainly the sub-Saharan part) can get on its feet.
