As a child and on into my grown-up years I was left with a nagging gut feeling that the things I had been "told" to believe were not quite right. I never once thought that God was to be feared. I am glad Sylvia cleared up so many stereo-types and wishy-washy crap people "claim" to be religion. This book, along with Sylvia's "Book of Dreams", really have changed my outlook on life for the better. I am not afraid of death, "The Other Side", or God for that matter. READ the book!! It is wonderfully written and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone
