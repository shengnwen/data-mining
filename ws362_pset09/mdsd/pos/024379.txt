Gay Talese does a brilliant job of narrating the evolution of sexuality during the 20th century.   By thoroughly including all the movers and shakers in the development of censorship legislation, sex shops, massage  parlors, communes and sexual revolutionists in enthralling detail, Talese  manages to create a riveting tale of human sexuality.  By infiltrating the  sexual revolution of the 60's and 70's, Talese offers first-hand accounts.   He artfully balances his keen observations as a slightly removed journalist  with indulgent, self-purposeful experimentation, then masterfully conveys  his findings to his audience.  Like &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;, Talese  invests a great deal of time and risk in researching his material and the  result is a page-turner.  While he tends to mention numerous names of  people who shaped 20th century sexuality, the result is not overwhelming  but instead may inspire you to keep a list of names as you read through the  book with the intention of researching these people yourself.  Indeed, this  masterpiece flows with gripping narrative style, introducing characters  that seemingly have no relationship to one another, until you read further  and find that their influence is intricately commingled.  This book will  fascinate you with its exploration and understanding of American sexual  identity.  A must read
