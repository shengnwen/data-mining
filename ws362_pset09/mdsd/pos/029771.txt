This book is easy-to-use and highly detailed with an appealing, bulleted layout and many illustrations that helped to answer most of my basic questions about the four categories of intellectual property (copyright, patents, trademarks and trade secrets).  I took a graduate-level library science course on the legal aspects of information and borrowed several books on IP from the library.  This Nolo Press book was the one that I kept coming back to and wound up buying.  I was glad I waited for the updated 7th edition, which now includes an index.  The book is divided into completely logical sections on definitions, statutes, forms and an overview, all of which make this book a joy to read.  The text is written in plain English and the entries are cross-referenced and other resources are given.  This is a legal book written by lawyers, but the legalese is edited out and only very useful information remains.  If you need one basic legal reference book on IP, this is the one you'll keep reaching for.
