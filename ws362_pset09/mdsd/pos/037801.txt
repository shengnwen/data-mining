Since most reviews are about the item itself I would first like to say that collecting SW merchandise for close to 30 yeras is my top priority. Those of you who also collect will find that for a short but good story book adventure for part V "The Empire Strikes Back", still brings the magic from Sir George Lucas to the small literature side of Sci-Fi adventure for all ages. I am not only saying this because I love the Star Wars Saga, but to be able to see that when kids re-inact the story means that they have read it, processed it and found it fun enough to act it. Those of you growing up in the 70's know what I mean. Now this new generation will never forget the experiance of being able to read a great sci-fi movie and sit back and say !!!WOW!!! this is great and can't wait for the next book to read!! "May The Force Be With Us All"
