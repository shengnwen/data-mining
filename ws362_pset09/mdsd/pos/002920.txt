This book at a glance looks simple, but there is so many deferent ways it is useful.  It is goo d to practice slow and then getting faster, also using one hand, or you feet. I think this book will set you mind free of pattern. It will let to do anything with either hand making you a better drummer.  You have to practice this and use it a lot to get anything out of it.  It is a must have for a drummer of any level
