This book tells you what Youth Ministry is all about...YOUTH! We are called to be Pastors to Youth not Recreation Directors. I encourage all who are in Youth Ministry or desire to work with youth to read this book. It gives great advise as to what and how we should work with Youth. Godbearing life will bring a NEW LIFE to your ministry and your walk with Christ
