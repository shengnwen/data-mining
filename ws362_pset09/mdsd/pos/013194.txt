I still do not have the faintest idea as to why Disney could possibly make this book into a children's movie. First of all, I would rate the unabridged book itself &quot;PG-13&quot;...but anyway. This book, more  popularly known as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (even though the  plot circles around the Cathedral, not Quasimodo) is like a twisted  &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; story sans star-crossed lovers. The real  protagonist (in my opinion) is Esmarelda, the sixteen year old gypsy  dancer. She falls passionatly in love with the chauvanistic stuff-shirt  Captain Pheobus whotakes advatage of her love while meanwhile courting a  young, rich noblewoman. Meanwhile, both Quasimodo the deaf bell-ringer and  Claude Frollo the fanatical archdeacon fall madly in love with Esmerelda.  So naturally things get quite chaotic when the gypsy is sentanced to death  for &quot;murdering&quot; the captain. The action so is spectacular,  especially the siege of Notre Dame, that I almost forgot I was reading it,  not actually standing in Place de la Greve watching it all happen.  Hopefully I don't give too much away when I say yes, there is a heck of a  lot of dying going on throughout the book. This book, unfortunately, does  have its long, slow, boring parts too...such as the beginning--just get  through it and you'll be alright. And unless you are an ardent scholar of  mideival architecture or French history, go ahead and skip the chapters  titled &quot;Notre-Dame&quot; and &quot;A birds eye view of Paris&quot;.  P.S: my favorite part...Esmarelda's &quot;marriage&quot; to Pierre  Gringiore, and also Gringiore's unhealthy obsession with the gypsy's goa
