Robert Romanyshyn's new book, The Soul in Grief, is a sensitive invitation to enter into a &quot;reverie&quot; of the rhythms of mourning.  The work is a thoughtful testimony and poetic meditation created out of the author's  painful and profoundly felt loss of his wife.  He shares moving, intimate  descriptions of the barrenness and the mystical moments of his grieving,  leading the reader towards his transformative discovery  of an unsuspected,  healing balm contained in the grief process itself. The Soul in Grief  documents a pilgrim's journey towards meaning in the experience of  devastating loss.  I am grateful to have this book available to recommend  and give to friends who are grieving losses from the past as well as a  recent death
