Other writers have related the events of the French Revolution with as much detail, but none has been able to bring it as vividly to life.  The style is very unusual and at first it is difficult to follow.  But then a  moment comes when the whole thing clicks, and suddenly it is as if you are  there in France in 1788 and the years that followed with a guide pulling at  your sleeve and pointing, saying &quot;look here&quot; and &quot;look  there.&quot;  The entire procession of people and events becomes  extraordinarily vivid and dream-like.  The storming of the Bastille becomes  almost a comic event.  The Reign of Terror becomes truly frightening and  horrifying.  The rise of Napoleon becomes completely understandable.  The  parallels to our own time become evident and disturbing.  This is not a  book for those who want a straighforward recounting of facts.  But if a  reader wants to gain an understanding of why events unfolded the way that  they did, it would be difficult to find a better book on this topic
