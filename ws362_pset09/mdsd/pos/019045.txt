It takes some dedication to get through the beginning of this book. 

Be prepared to be thrust in to the story with little idea of what's happening at first. I had the feeling that once Keyes gathered all of his characters together at the end of the second book he didn't know what to do with them, so at the beginning of this one he goes about separating them in a very disjointed way. Though this seemed messy, it wound up neatly in the end. 

In this volume, puzzle pieces begin falling in place at last. Fend takes on a more important role. Stephen as well. Some light is cast upon the mysterious Sefry. Anne makes her first big move as future Queen. 

Keyes continues to rule the day with superb characterization, surprising plot twists, energized battles, and powerful use of language (Whether it be English, Vitellian, Vadhiian, or any one of his other invented languages.) A main character dies in this one (and it won't be who you suspect.) 

Looking forward to the fourth (and final?) volume.
