I find the mozart effect an interesting concept and have purchased a few cds for my newborn.  I love classical music, and I do find that when we listen to good music, we feel energized and uplifted.  

I'm not sure I buy into all of the claims here, but one thing is for sure:  classical music does have a calming effect and for that, I give this book 4 stars
