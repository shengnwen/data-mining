Driver drives, that's all he does. He doesn't want details. Just tell him where to be and when to be there. That's all. 
By day, he's one of Hollywood's best stunt drivers. By night, he's one of the underworld's best getaway drivers. Corruption and scandal litters both industries, but he stays out of it. He's survived unscathed because he only drives and he doesn't want details. His reputation has a long reach. He has become a hot commodity in both professions because all he does is drive... until he gets double-crossed, and then his business mantra changes. 

It was a simple job. Easy money. But things turned south quickly, and soon Driver finds himself bleeding in a run-down motel room surrounded by three dead bodies and straining to listen for the distant sounds of sirens. He knows who's responsible and he has nothing to lose. 

The plot flows through a series of flashbacks building the character known as Driver. Raised in a foster home, he is the product of simple self-preservation and the evolution of childhood dreams into day-to-day survival. Driver's past is filled with images of a broken mother and a lost chance at love, interspersed with memories of an underground surgeon who could challenge the Mayo Clinic's best and a mentor who gave him his first big break. As the character takes form, the story takes hold. The suspense is as thick as Driver's outer shell and the action is as fast and heavy as his right foot. 

In the end, Driver - a once nomadic kid who loved cars - becomes part of modern American folklore, at least to those who love to drive. 

It's a short novel but flows more like a long short story and it's quite entertaining in an urban legend kind of way, and Driver is a character who commands fascination. The recurring flashbacks chop up the storyline and it may take more than one read-through to fully appreciate the writer's style and the sequence of events, but overall this one is a winner.
