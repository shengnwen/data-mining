Downing makes a strong and easy to follow argument that European governments were able to support the modern standing armies of the 17th and 18th centuries only by destroying decentralized proto-representative institutions inherited from medieval times and taking direct control of taxation, conscription, and military leadership.  Such governments then developed into autocracies, whereas, in countries that either didn't need large standing armies or were able to support those armies by plunder rather than taxation, the medieval institutions survived and eventually developed into democracies.  The argument is backed by interesting, although brief, comparitive historical analyses of Prussia, France, Britain, Poland, Holland, and Sweden.  Personally, I wasn't entirely convinced, but Downing is an unusually clear and concise writer and knows his stuff, so it's worth deciding for yourself
