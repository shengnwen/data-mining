I read these books when I was much younger, and re-read them every time I come back to my parents' house.  They are incredibly well written; characters, plot, and dialogue are all wonderfully done.  
Dido is possibly one of the best female children's characters ever written, and I'd even argue that she's one of the best female characters ever, forget children's books.  She is resourceful, irreverent, intelligent, moral, funny, and completely unsanitized.  I love all of the books in this series, but this one is my favorite.
The only reason that these could be called "children's"  books is that there's no sex.  They absolutely do not underestimate the intelligence of the reader.  Joan Aiken writes young adult novels in the style of Susan Cooper and Lloyd Alexander -- these books are terrifying, beautiful, chilling, funny and intelligent in a way that children's books no longer are and *should* be.  Joan Aiken will be sorely missed
