  If you love Spinelli you HAVE to read this book. It made me laught A LOT,Some of the book made me think, It kept me guessing and sometimes made me cry. I think everyone should read this book because, I think everyone would love it and it would make you laugh and cry at the same time. It is a story that will teach you to accept peolple for who they are and really make you think about life.
