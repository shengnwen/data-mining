I remember reading (and loving) this book when I was about 11.  So I bought it for my 11-year old daughter and reread it myself.  While I have some criticisms of the book now that I didn't as a child (more about things that could have made it even better rather than things that were wrong with it), I still loved the book and my daughter did too.  It's a wonderful parable of love and tolerance and understanding, on the one hand, and of ignorance, intolerance and bigotry on the other.  I still would have liked to know more about Jon's world and have developed his interactions with people and animals in our world too
