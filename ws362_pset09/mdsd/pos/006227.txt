Jim Cain recently conducted a workshop for our ACA group. He mentioned that the book came about because he was giving out a thick stack of hand-outs at his workshops that were darn close to a book. So he put them  together and created this book. The energy and spirit that Jim shows in his  workshops is clearly reflected in this book. Although nothing can really  replace an &quot;in-person&quot; demonstration of the activities, this book  gives clear explainations and examples in a &quot;how to&quot; format.  Along with a section on how to build many of the activities with supplies  easily available at many home improvement centers. There are activities for  youth, schools, camps, corporate; large budget or small budget. This book  is an excellent investment
