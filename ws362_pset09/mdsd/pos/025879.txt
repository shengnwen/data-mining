In the begining, the book's quite confusing. I don't know
if the "children" are dogs because Jerry Spinelli called the children "pups". But read on! It soon gets very interesting. Something bad about this book is that it doesn't end, the story doesn't get finished. I wish there was a LOSER II! Some parts are a bit confusing too, you may need to read a sentence a few times to understand its full meaning. Overall, Jerry has written a fantastic book
