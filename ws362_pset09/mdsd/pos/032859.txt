This book is simply incredible. Having read &quot;Grandfather&quot; and &quot;The Tracker&quot; before this book, I found myself on an incredible journey through the Vision Quest. I found that it deepened my desire to do  as Tom Brown, Jr. has done. The Vision Quest in the cave towards the end  was absolutely amazing. It is probably best to read at least &quot;The  Tracker&quot; before this one, but it's not totally necessary. A must read  at any rate
