My favorite chapter of this book was "Branding the Babies" that provided an historical summary of the methods and initiatives by the US Congress, the Reagan and Clinton administrations to solve the illegal immigration issue.  The writing style of this book is fluent, easy to read, no political agenda, just good unbiased, yet entertaining journalism.  Roberto Suro is brilliant with the English language and provides inside glimpses into the Latino community, including the gangs.
