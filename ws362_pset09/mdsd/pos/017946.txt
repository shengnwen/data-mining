This truly is one of the most remarkable books I've ever read and I would encourage anyone with an interest in military science, government or leadership to take the time to read it.  This book requires commitment and a quiet place to read and savor its thought-provoking passages.  The investment of time and effort is dwarfed by the magnitude of the lessons this book has to offer.  Make the commitment and you'll see why this book was a favorite of men like Alexander the Great, Scipio Africanus, Caesar and Machiavelli
