this book was very helpful and thought provoking. many times in our life we will simply go to the doctor with what ever ails us and we fail to see that there is also a spiritual part to us as well,our mind,will,& emotions. dr. colbert reviews various people with different health problems and sees a common factor in all of them-strong pain and anger or unforgiveness and it did seem to contribute to their present conditions.by the way, i am a christian (definetly not a hateful one either i may add :) and the bible itself always addresses the condition of our hearts first and foremost so we will let go of the bondage ( anger jealousy,unforgiveness,bitterness,rage ) it is always part of our total healing that God wants us to receive. i believe dr. colbert communicates this truth very effectively
