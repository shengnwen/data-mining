This book is a must read for everyone involved in the wide field of evangelical theology. The first reason for this: McGrath takes serious the development of theology and modern thinking as a whole. Consequently he  actively faces the questions given in our modern postmodernist and  pluralist society from moderate evangelical point of view. Therefore the  book lacks the strong apologetic tone of a lot of its evangelical  counterparts.Otherwise, McGrath does not shy away from declaring the  liberal theology that governs a wide area ofthe academic thinking as  outdated and of not much use for today's questions. Interestingly enough he  views the so-called postliberal school of theology as the natural ally of  evangelicalism. This is of course miles away from any fundamentalist  approach of old. The second reason: It grounds theology in a clear  commitment in the person of Jesus Christ and the Bible as Holy Scripture.  But while this is a clear witness in itself, the reader would wish the  critical questions more intensely be tackled. The reader might feel, that  McGrath is right in almost all that he says in this part, but may still  wonder how these two foundations may be held in dialogue with the critical  findings of much of Old and New Testament research. Nevertheless I find  McGrath's book as one of the best cases for evangelical theology I've ever  read. It seems to me, that he's looking in that direction, towards which  evangelical theology is to go if it wants to remain
