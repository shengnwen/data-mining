Considering 'pulp romance' is the top selling genre, one could do a lot worse than the classic mother of all romances, "Pride & Prejudice". 

This perceptive classic of English society plays out like a 19th century "Sex In The City."  Miscommunications abound. Just as you're about to scream, another dangle of hope transpires. Will the young lovers EVER end up on the same page?  I'm not telling you if you've missed this classic.  You'll have to read it.
