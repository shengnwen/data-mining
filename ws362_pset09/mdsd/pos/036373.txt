I like Stephen King's books. I have not read them all but I have put a serious dent in the King inventory and believe him to be one of the finest writers of our era. His popularity and prolific writing attests to his skill to spin a yarn. 

Hearts in Atlantis disturbed me more than his other books (that are gory at times but are ultimately fantasy). It's to King's credit that I'm disturbed, and attests to his writing skill. I've witnessed much violence in my life in different countries and I'm intimately acquainted with human folly. 

Ultimately I found the book hard to read precisely because King is such a good novelist. Do I recommend it? Sort of
