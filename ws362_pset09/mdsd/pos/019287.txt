Although I am barely halfway through the book, I find the writing insightful and thought provoking. Since most religious concepts and precepts are expressed in philosophical terms I don't understand why one reader wrote "Leave your religion out of it. Religion doesn't mix well with sophisticated philosophy." Such a statement is simple-minded, narrow-minded and a common hallmark of 'militant fundamentalist atheists'. The Stoic Art of Living is not written for such individuals. Its concepts are, however, ideal for those with an inquiring and open mind.
