Reading the begining of this book I was totally blown away by this book. It was intresting to read about the concept of barriers of entry and local dominance that the writers has their own thoughts about. This is new stuff (diffrent from Micahel Porter) but not enough to write a whole book. So what is followed is already famous examples of competitive wars between famous companies that has taken place. The writers try to prove their theories but in reality, I dont buy it. Wanna learn more about strategy, go for the military books. Or go for Co-ompetition, thats a better book
