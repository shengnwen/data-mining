I just finished volume 1. I found this to be a great book. The selection of games is excellent; Kasparov's idea for the book of paralleling the history of the championship with the ongoing development of the game itself is a good one. This is a highly entertaining as well as educational chess book.
 
 It is important to note that the errors in analysis are NOWHERE near as numerous or egregious as other reviews would lead you to believe. I have studied the annotations in detail, many of them with my computer, and found only a small number of (for the most part inconsequential) oversights. (Anybody who thinks they have found 20 errors in one game has made at least 19 blunders.) The only minus is the psychobabble of placing each champion &quot;in the context of his times.&quot;
 
 One area that does concern me is the appearance of parenthetical comments marked GK in several places (e.g., page 305) which are not quotes of other analysts. Did Kasparov use unattributed analysis
