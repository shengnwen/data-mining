I really enjoyed this novel.  It tells the story of a man that killed three dragons.  However, all of that happened before this novel even starts.  Many novels in this genre would give you mostly action.  This book gives you some action, but it doesn't get bogged down by it.  This book tells you about what happens after most of the action has already taken place.  It is a breath of fresh hair to not have to read about tons of darkness which is the case in many similar fantasy stories.  The first three books in this novel are full of character development as characters grow and become a sort of family.  This all leads up to book four where the world that Roarke creates is turned on its ear, and everyone must deal with the fourth and final dragon.  As a side note, I liked the author's take on dragons.

This novel is very touching in areas as the characters have many joys and tremendous hardships.  I am very anxious to read more about this world in the next novel
