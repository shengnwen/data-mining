I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Not only do the authors give 50 of the most frequently asked interview questions, but they analyze each question and give a wrong and right answer.  The authors also discuss the seven  factors that employers look for in an employee and stories people told in  interviews that demonstrated they had these qualities to get them the job.  The workbook at the end of each chapter helped me to really work through my  thoughts and prepare myself. I feel much more at ease about my interviews  having read this book. I highly recommend it.  Very up-to-dat
