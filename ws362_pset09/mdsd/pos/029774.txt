This simple little story is an old one that I first heard many years ago.  The youngster in this book is saddled with several obstacles.  Child labor laws are yet to come about - her father sends her out into the world to work.  The family deals with poverty and hunger.  Improperly clothed, the little girl is sure to succomb to frostbite.  She knows that her father will surely abuse her if she comes home empty-handed.  With no way out, this youngster turns to her own rich inner life to help her transcend her impossible situation.  This is the story of the power of love - the love of her own late grandmother - that sustains her as she slips into her own death.  It is a lasting parable about looking within to find the resources that sustain us.
