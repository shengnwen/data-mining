An openly critical novel in respect to slavery in the US that stereotypes the main characters to provide an overview of the situation, Uncle Tom's Cabin provides insight into the definite cruelties and suffering involved with slavery, and surprisingly they not only affect the slaves themselves. Uncle Tom finds himself passed on from trader to trader, and indeed the only thing that keeps him safe is his master's character. His abrupt change from caring, respectable masters like Mr. Shelby and St. Clare, both of whom struggle with their consciences, to Simon Legree, the representation of all evils, play on the emotions of the reader. Even his two early masters are stereotypes of their age: one is a kind master who would treat his slaves well (unless, of course, money issues would press him into letting go of his most valuable possession--Tom). St. Clare, although both kind and fair, lets his slaves run free about his plantation because he does not want to begin controlling them, lest he will never know when to stop when the slave begin to build up resistance to the pain. Days before gaining his freedom, fateful circumstances lead to Tom's transfer to the perilous care of the reckless Simon Legree. But in spite of his experiences with the wrongs committed on the plantation, Tom finds a way to cling to his morals and follow his heart, eventually dying a martyr, but at the same time influencing his peers, (and "superiors"), in such a way that his spirit is kept alive through the positive outcomes that resulted. A poignant, inspiring novel that urges men and women all over the world to continue believing in the right through thick and thin, Uncle Tom's Cabin will forever keep the memory of the honest hearts of men and women all over the United States who suffered through such prejudice and overcame
