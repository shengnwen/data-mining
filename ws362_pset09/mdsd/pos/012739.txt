Please note: English is not my mother labguage. So, my review may a bit hard to read. But I really want to share my idea. 

Summary:
Good introduction for anybody who really want to understand how to be a good web editor and how to manage content to make the benefit for your business. However, this book need more example or case study to fulfill reader's need.  

Overview:
Content critical generally reveals the important of content and how can we enhance the user (which author define his user as a 'reader') experience with content. I recommend anybody who interested in information architecture (IA), User experience (UX) to read this book since it explore deep into the area of content. 

Good things and not really good things:
Content is quite broad terms. It is not easy to conclude every perspective about content into only one book. But author has the journalism background which is one of the most suitable career to write this book. He descrbe which kind of 'e-content' is good for 'reader' with simple language and without any IT jargon. He also have done a good job on creating the ROI calculation formular. Yet, good comparison between traditional publishing and electronic publishing. This book might be a good reference for students who attend the e-publishing class. If I have a chance to change the name of this book. I think it should be "How to be a good web editor". 

Nevertheless, this book still need more case study diagram and picture to make it more easy to understand.

Who should buy this book?
If you are in e-content business already; you may not enjoy to read it because it is too general and lack of case study for you to apply it with your work. But, if you think content is very important (and critical) and you still need to learn more about e-content. This is a great introduction for you.
