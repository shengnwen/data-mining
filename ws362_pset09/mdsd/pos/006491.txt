I was very pleased to read the latest Jane Kirkpatrick book.  She always turns a location or historical event into flesh and blood stories.  This was no exception.  She has tied 3 different stories on the same piece of land near Shaniko/Dallas Oregon.  Her books are always filled with hope and promise and good Christian values
