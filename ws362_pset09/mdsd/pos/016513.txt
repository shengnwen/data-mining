My husband got this book from the library and all I heard was him laughing while he read it. We bought it for my daughter who lives in Florida and is an environmental science teacher. Before giving it to her during a recent visit, I had to read it. I too laughed like crazy. Carl has a way of putting all the bad stuff people have done to the state of Florida in a humorous manner but gets his point across at the same time
