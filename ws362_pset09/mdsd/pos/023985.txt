Anne Lamott is a woman after my own heart!  I have heard that Christian book stores will not sell her books--Shame on them! The readers are missing out on an author who will undress completely and reveal her dirty sins for everybody to see---Anne is exsactly the sort of Christian who will bring others to Christ: non-judgemental, accepting, loving, smart, says it how it is, an alcholic, a  former druggie, a mom who hates her teenager!,a woman who hates her thighs, a women who swears sometimes and yes, a Libral!  OHHHH Boy! is that naughty for a Christian to be? Oh, I almost forgot--- Anne gives Jesus all of the glory for her transformation.

I Loved "Furthur Thoughts on Faith."  I laughed outloud at Anne's observations about life, teens, church, God, and the world.  "Does everybody scream outragously (as if their crazy) and go absolutely insane with their teenagers?"  Anne asks her readers this.  Now--tell me, would a Christian admit this?  I am thinking, Yea--I am like this, I identify with this, I am far from perfect; but I am trying! 

Anne does not only talk the talk---but she is proactive, and says without hesitation how she feels about President Bush, the war in Iraq, and what we should be doing to save the world. What I love about Anne is that she is not this perfect little Christian stuck in a pretty little box, behaving and thinking like a pitiful little robot.  One could say that Anne has erupted and ripped free from that box in a big way.

What is boils down to---is Anne Lamott loves Jesus---and He is using her to reach people who otherwise would not be reached; the sinners who can come to Him just as they are; beautifully imperfect. Even if they are liberals!
