Anthony Bourdain is a person I would be friends with if I knew him.  He's cynical, he's blunt and he loves food.  

"Kitchen Confidential" is a collection of tales from Chef Bourdain's past-- these stories are all very memorable.  As many other reviewers have stated, the book is funny and eye-opening.  But what I also want to add is that Bourdain is a very good writer.  He knows how to tell a story that is fast-moving, interesting, funny and worthwhile.  The bulk of the book takes place in the New York City restaurant scene, which is a universe unto itself.  Bourdain's personal experiences through this maze of liars, drugs, cheats and the mafia are fascinating.  When I was finished, I was sad that the stories ended.  I have since vowed to go to Bourdain's downtown bistro Les Halles to experience this guy's menu.  But "Kitchen Confidential" is first and foremost about the insane people that make the food.  I highly recommend this book.
