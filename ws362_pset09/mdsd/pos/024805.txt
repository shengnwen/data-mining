This book shows there could be millions of minorities living in a stagnant way of life, where they're not able to achieve or dream of the so called American dream. I loved this book, I felt this book, this book is important and it should be read by anybody that cares for those living a life that's unimaginable to many of us. Through everything Lafayette and Pharaoh were still children, I felt a lot of hope in this book. Through it all there was some kind of peace. This is my favorite book from Alex, I've read his other book The Other Side of the River and There Are No Children Here is his absolute best
