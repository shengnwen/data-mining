Jerry Muller's objective is to trace the origin and evolution of a central tenet of economics: the market. But rather than start with Adam Smith (he comes second), Muller reaches back to Voltaire and the Enlightenment: he sees Voltaire's criticism of religion as a crucial step toward acceptance of capitalism.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the evolution of ideas and the role of individual thinkers, ranging from the famous (Karl Marx) to the less famous (Justus Mser??)
