This is one of the best biographies I have read in years.  Shackleton is a compelling figure, but this is not an exercise in hero worship.  Shackleton is presented with all his faults and flaws.  He's a leader extraordinaire, but he's not much of a husband and even less a financier.  Extremely enjoyable even if you know the outcome of Endurance's voyage.
