Obsession, identity, werewolves, trolls, Hollywood corruption, distorted fairytales, sex, irony, angels, illusions: such is the mix of Neil Gaiman. A master of scenarios, Gaiman is terrifically imaginative and evocative in the stories and poems of Smoke and Mirrors. 

Gaiman manages to integrate elements of fantasy into the real-life settings of dirty streets and motel rooms. Ninety-five percent of the time, he does this without being corny. In one story, a woman finds the Holy Grail in a thrift shop. In another, a young man casually runs into the former Angel of Vengeance in the streets of LA. But not every story uses myth of fantastical creatures-some thrive on subtle horror. In one of my favorite stories, a man travels on a less-than-ideal walking tour of the British Coastline and meets two fellows who, inside a drunken haze, may or may not exist. Gaiman also experiments with uncanny what-ifs: in one story, a man's venereal disease changes his identity against his will. He experiments with form and style, in one case writing in the dialect of an 11-year-old. He twists on traditional tales, as a sinister version of Snow White appears at the end. 

A couple pieces could have been omitted from this collection, simply because they were amateurish or reeked of bad metaphors. I' m also not sure how well fantasy and poetry merge together, as none of the poems in the collection particularly shined for me. But it's a collection I'll certainly turn to again in the future to experience its surreal and bizarre mood.
