This book is great. It divided milan into smaller sections so it's easy to figure out where everything is located. It's rare to find so many pictures that are as big and clear as they are in this book. There's also a street finder map in the back, which is very helpful. It really helped me prepare for my upcoming study abroad trip to milan
