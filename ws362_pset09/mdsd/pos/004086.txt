To dismiss this book as just an excuse to dredge up some titillating photographs for the purpose of publishing is an injustice.  This collection is an historical perspective on many levels - the camera as a art form since its invention, a survey of sociolgical transformations as to the perception of homosexuality,  the psychological sweep from the closet to the stage to Stonewall to the AIDS bedside and beyond.  There are many many captured moments that seem voyeuristic in the best sense of the word in that the spontaneity of individuals interacting as well as groups entertaining are fresh and often off guard.  Here is a portfolio of tenderness, of hilarity, and of tragedy.  Would that there were more essays interspersed to document the various periods traversd.  But then we must also pay homage to the phrase &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;.  Well worth your time
