I am so excited!!! Even though I haven't tried any of the recipes yet (my book is in the mail) I have tasted his extraordinary pastries, personally, at "M" cafe de chaya on Melrose in West Hollywood. 

I live two hours away and travel there specifically to eat his fabulous creations. They are all healthy for you and well worth the trip into that ungodly traffic. The lemon and chocolate tarts at "M" are to die for.

I have seen the book. The layout/design are five star beautiful. It contains full color pictures for every recipe. Yum ... I can't imagine the recipes being anything less than perfect.

A work of art with heart
