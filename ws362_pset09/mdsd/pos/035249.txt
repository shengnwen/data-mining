4.75 Stars

George Plimpton is quoted as having said that The Gloves "As good a book as any I've read about the sport" - not exactly a ringing endorsement and I was a little worried -

This is actually a great book right from the start. 

I was immediately hooked and addicted to his trainer's (Milton) style of fighting - something about the concept of Southpaw's just grabs me and especially a non-natural Southpaw - anyway that's what truly hooked me in.

The story is true - and the experience of reading Anasi's practice and journey through the world of amateur boxing is so real and compelling that you just can't put the book down.

The characters and people he meets and trains with are very interesting and he does such a great job in retelling his tale.

There was a point where the book dragged a bit, but as a whole it's a great story.

It's an impressive, exciting and honest look at amateur boxing, of amateur boxers and the sport of boxing in general.

Great book - give it a read.
