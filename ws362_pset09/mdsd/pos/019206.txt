Dragon's Lair is the third book in the "Queen's Man" series.  I started the series with this book and had no trouble popping right into the world of Justin, our hero.  While the scope of this book isn't close to the depth of her other works (Here be Dragon's comes to mind), it certainly sets out what in intends to do, and that's deliver a thoughtful mystery. As an avid reader of historical fiction it seems that the historical fiction mysteries are often the worst of the genre. My chief complaint, other than poor writing, is the window dressing the actual history gets in the mysteries - more often than not the historical period is a cheese cloth back drop to a more modern tale (I'm looking at you Owen Archer). Penman makes it look so easy, which is why she's such a joy to read.  Fairly said, Dragon's Lair is "light" reading & there is one instance where she uses a very hackneyed ploy to move the plot along - the eavesdrop (however, it's not as bad as the frequent over use of coincidence you'll find in other mysteries). Despite my brief irritation, she spun out of it with a twist that I didn't see coming and I was more than willing to utter a silent apology and quit my nitpicking. You're in good hands with her.
If you're looking for a weekend read - I more than recommend this book.
Enjoy!
