This is a standard almanac of the kind 'Information Please' has been putting out for years. 
I read some of the country - entries to check for accuracy. I found them generally quite good, but not without a certain bias at times.
This Almanac provides all the usual features of almanacs, and can be a useful source of reference. Even with the 'Internet' there are times when certain kinds of information are more readily found by turning pages.
