This book is comprehensive. Lists everything you need and the instructions are great. If you are new to sewing like I am, take it slow and read the instructions carefully. Re-read if necessary. My bowls are improving with each new bowl I make. 

Those hard to buy for people will be easier with this gift idea.
Have fun
