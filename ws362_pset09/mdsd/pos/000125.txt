Doug's book is a very good text on the use of natural light in photography. He explains how to "see the light" and use it to your best advantage. The book is tailored to professional photographers, but many of the ideas can be used to improve any amateur shutterbug's pictures.

The only downside of this book is that it emphasises film cameras. In today's digital age, this part of the book is a bit dated
