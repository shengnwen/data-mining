This book is small, relatively short, and so deeply and richly written that it is best enjoyed in tiny bites.  One day I was so rocked by one of the featured poems that I committed the verse to memory.  Connections is as powerful as Roth's movement practice, yet as with the dance work, its accessible to anyone, from novice to veteran.  The writing is clear, yet conversational. Its tone and mood shift but at its core, Roth shares with her readers an extended meditation on the persistent fragility of life and the strength that comes from that deep level of knowing.  September 11, 2001 is a character in this slim book of considered musings.  What Roth offers in this book is a path through numb, sad and grieving back to the breath and the heartbeat.  Its a piece of writing to be treasured and shared.
