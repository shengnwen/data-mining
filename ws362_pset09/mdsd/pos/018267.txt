This book, written in a simple straightforward style almost like Young Adult fiction, is very good. I learned so much about Filipino culture from reading this book. I am American and my partner is Filipino and he was surprised at all the things I discovered about the culture, food, language and customs of Filipinos while reading a compelling story. The recipes tucked into every chapter will make you hungry. A very good read!!
