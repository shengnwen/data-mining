Shirley Hazzard has an original voice.  I am aware from some comments that her prose is challenging to some readers but for many others her words flow beautifully; it is the kind of writing that one loves to speak aloud.  

I had previously read a non-fiction book - Greene On Capri - and that led me to The Bay of Noon.  The story is a simple one of people relating to each other.  Jenny comes to Naples alone to work at an English mission after the Second World War.  She has an introduction to Gioconda, a lovely woman who is a writer and her lover, a film director named Gianni.  At her place of work she meets a Scotsman named Justin the three of them become more and more involved with Jenny, and how each changes in their relationships.  

I must confess that one of the reasons why I selected this book is the setting of Naples.  Having visited the city, I particularly enjoyed Ms. Hazzard's descriptions of the streets and buildings of Naples and, of course, the wonderful bay.  Chapter seven is particularly evocative of Naples where Jenny relates her growing love of the city.   Ms. Hazzard follows the development of Jenny from a girl evacuated to Africa, to a young woman experiencing love for the first time to a mature woman who has acquired wisdom over time.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a writer who weaves a beautiful tapestry of words and delves deeply into the psyche of her characters.
