I have read the Fountainhead many times and I was pleasantly surprised by this cliffs notes summary and analysis of the book.  It includes a short biography of Ayn Rand but the bulk of the book is spent on detailed going  over of Ayn Rand's plot, theme, and characters.  It is fascinating to read  an intelligent analysis of the characters I love.  The gems of the book are  the two critical essays; The Literary Integration of the Fountainhead and  Ayn Rands Writing Style.    This book is written by an Objectivist author  and is definately worth buying
