Drugs are effective for some people with ADD. Or so I've been told. I tried Ritalin, Welbutrin, Adderall, Zoloft, Lexapro, Neurontin and others in various combinations. My ADD did not improve but I experienced a host of side effects including dizziness, insomnia, headache, increased irritability, loss of physical abilities and back pain. 

Getting Rid Of Ritalin explains how neurofeedback works as an alternative to drugs. Neurofeedback trains the brain to regulate itself. The book is easy to read and filled with common sense. The author uses a scientific approach and shows a personal concern for those who suffer from ADD. There are insights that help to explain symptoms and how they can be improved. One of the best things about this treatment regimen (neurofeedback) is that it has virtually NO side effects! 

Neurofeedback has helped me. I am in a better mood, more organized and less irritable. According to Robert Hill- drugs, even when they work, are only a temporary solution. After a while they lose their effectiveness. And I can testify to how expensive they are. Before you spend thousand on brain scans and psycho-active drugs try letting your brain heal itself with neurofeedback
