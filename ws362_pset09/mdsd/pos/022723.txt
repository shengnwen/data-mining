Reyita's story is both touching and inspiring.  As a Black Cuban woman she suffered a great deal of hardship, which she worked very hard to overcome especially for her children.  Stories about her life were very interesting and informative and present a picture of Cuba that is not generally known.  Black women all over the diaspora can relate to her story and her desire to have more for her children.  Some may question her decision to marry outside her race as a product of poor self-esteem, but she provides a well-reasoned argument to better the lives of her children.  I would have loved the opportunity to meet this lady
