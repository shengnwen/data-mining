America's hero Mitch Rapp returns for another superb encore. CIA Director designate Irene Kennedy is in top form as is President Robert Hayes who seems to be much more decisive in this book than he has in other parts of the series. The bad guys are there: Senator Hank Clark, Representative  Albert Rudin,Jonathan Brown, a former judge and envious contender for the position of CIA Director as well as Ben Fiedman Director General of the, Mossad, a loyalist to his country but still greedy for himself. Sadam Hussein is close to having three operational nuclear devices. A daring mission inside Iraq ensues. Plus, the bad guys are taken care of. Excellent
