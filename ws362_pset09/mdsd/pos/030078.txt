Generally, the words "quirky" and "witty" are the kiss of death when applied to books, but Sarah Vowell's has written a book that is both-- and it's a great read.  It may be difficult to understand how someone could write a book about the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley that is respectful of the history (and, generally, of the men) but is laugh-out-loud funny in many places, but Vowell pulls it off.

The book is a combination of travelogue, memoir, and history that came out of her travels to numerous sites that are associated with the first three presidential assassinations.  On the face of it, that sounds like a bad idea for a book, but what might be deadly dull is not, mostly because of Vowell's witty style.  In addition, the book is thoughtful and even moving.

A bonus is the vast store of presidential assassination trivia that Vowell packs in.  My favorite:  Robert Todd Lincoln was present in the Peterson House when his father died.  No surprise there; however, he witnessed the fatal wounding of Garfield in a Washington, DC, train station, and he walked into the building at the Pan American Exhibition where McKinley was shot just minutes after the event.  Weird enough, but when he was a student at Harvard, he fell off of a train station platform in Boston and was rescued by a notable actor who happened to be on the scene: Edwin Booth, brother of John Wilkes Booth.

This is a wonderful book that richly rewards the effort of reading it.
