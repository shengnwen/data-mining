This was the first book ever written on the classic I LOVE LUCY series (possibly the first book ever written about a single television series) and it's still the best.  I am currently on my second copy of it, my old paperback now replaced by the latest updated version. Stands up beautifully a quarter of a century after it was written. It's not a gossip fest or a academic study, just a straight-forward and detailed look at America's most beloved tv show and certainly it's most gifted television star.  Way to go Bart!
