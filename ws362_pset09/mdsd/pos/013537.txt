I seem to keep giving Mr. King all 5 stars.  Well, so what!?  His books are worth it.  I took my time with this book because I knew it was the last one in the series and I didn't want it to end.  The ending will send chills up your spine and you get closer and closer to the Dark Tower.  The journey, the roses, Roland, the history... King is one of the masters!
