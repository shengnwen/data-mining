i very much enjoyed reading this book.ansay is a beautiful writer although there are a few times where it seems she is trying too hard,and it doesn't flow as well.they probably just stand out in contrast to the rest of the prose,however.the people and places she talks about really come alive. i can relate to a lot of the catholic upbringing,though her experience of it was more intense than mine.the conclusions she comes to at the end of the book are not for the philosophically naive,and are reminiscent of much of eastern philosophy. however,i think there are more chapters to follow,and i hope someday she will write another installment as her life unfolds further
