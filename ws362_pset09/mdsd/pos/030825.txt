Highly regarded scholar of the Western Frontier Indian Wars, Jerome A. Greene has applied his wealth of knowledge in military operations, his impeccable research skills, and his fluid prose style to this excellent book on the siege of Yorktown, 1781. I recommend reading the extensive and informative appendix which covers the archeology of the Yorktown Battlefield as well as the equipment and stategies necessary to operate an effective siege and military victory.
