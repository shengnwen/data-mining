After reading this book, one can learn what a British traveller thought about Spain. Furthermore, and despite some mistakes in the use of the Spanish language, Ford proves to have been a really learned gentleman.
This book is going to be very helpful for someone interested--like myself--in knowing a foreign opinion about Spain
