Deborah Crombie is stepping into the realm of the psychlogical thriller genre with this book.  And she can stand up against some of the masters such as Barbara Vine or Elizabeth George.  I am a huge fan of this series, and I found this book a little different than the previous ones in the series.  For one we have excerpts in the book where Ms. Crombie steps into the mind of a psycopath.  In this book Gemma and Duncan are on a Christmas holiday at Duncan's home.  The festivities are soon marred by many dark and dangerous happenings.  It starts when Duncan's sister finds the mummefied body of a baby in the wall of an old barn.  Before the mystery is unravelled there is a murder.  What Ms. Crombie does so well is the characters and the family relationships, and this book is full of these.  I truly enjoyed this story.  I understand why we had to wait another year before we could read it.  This book was to come out last year.  It is a complex and rich tale, that shows Gemma and Duncan in a different light.  In this book they aren't "on the job" so to speak, so lose some of their official clout
