Richard Unger blows a lot of the dust off the casually quoted historical dogma of the "better beer" world. Hops were used for centuries before their description by a nun, and gruit, a mixture of herbs and spices used to flavor beer prior to the use of hops, was actually still popular AFTER hops were introduced. Unger doesn't just quote the last "beer writer" he read when he makes these statements, he cites primary sources, economic records, contemporary correspondence in 60 pages of footnotes and bibliography. 

The result is a book that brings to life the beginnings of commercial brewing. Brewing went from a household chore to a commercial enterprise during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, built trade empires, influenced civilizations. Unger puts beer in its proper place in European history as an integral keystone of trade, a solid source of cash taxes, and a perfect example of how over-regulation can kill an industry.

The striking thing about this book for a student of contemporary brewing is not the techniques, the character of the beer. It is the parallels between beer's rise in this period and beer's revival in the 20th Century. Nothing is new under the sun: there were contract brewers, stunningly hopped beers, hugely successful imports, fad beers that really only changed names, fruit beers, and wild advertising. Today's innovations? Not hardly.

Definitely a scholarly work, and tough slogging at times to get through the tax chapters. But full of meat and well worth the effort
