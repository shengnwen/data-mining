I loved this strategies and secrets book. It was easy to understand and gave me the information and walkthroughs to play Dungeon Siege II. Dungeon Siege II is a larger game than Dungeon Siege I and the book gave me useful tips and secrets to enjoy playing the Dungeon Siege sequel. I highly recommend it
