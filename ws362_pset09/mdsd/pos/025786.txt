Leila Ahmed's WOMEN AND GENDER IN ISLAM is a wonderfully iconoclastic history of ideas about Muslim women.  Cheerfully debunking every stereotype American readers have about women in the Islamic heartland, Ahmed weaves  together theological and literary sources, statistics and travelers' tales,  to create a narrative far more complex and even-handed than any other I  have read on the topic.  Her focus is on the development of ideas rather  than the physical details of women's lives, yet many individual women  sparkle in her tale.  Whether she is identifying the cultural influences  which led early Islam toward misogyny and away from egalitarianism  (elements of both misogyny and egalitarianism existing in Arab society and  thought at the time) or showing how Muslim modernizers were influenced by  colonial European racism (which used a pseudo-feminism to denigrate  traditional non-Western cultures), her writing is sophisticated and  graceful.  Never heavy or dogmatic, careful to limit her conclusions and  generalizations, Ahmed's integrity is matched only by her feminism.  She  would be the first to suggest how much more work needs to be done in the  study of Muslim women, but WOMEN AND GENDER IN ISLAM is a marvelous  beginning
