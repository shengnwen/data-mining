We own a San Diego interior design company (Anna Rode Designs), and frequently are called on to give advice to home sellers on ways to make their homes stand out from the crowd without spending a fortune. This book is an excellent reference for homeowners, who should take their advice seriously. Of course, it can't provide design advice like interior designers can, but it is full of sound pointers that any homeowner can do: de-cluttering, brightening rooms, cleaning, painting, eliminating personal items, and so forth. We recommend this book to our clients
