I've read books a thousand times more boring than this one. But I noticed a lot of people talking about the title and that it's misleading.. OK... LOVE AND DEATH. That's just a plain and not very original statement. I don't see a question there... The Murder of Kurt Cobain. Again, NO BLOODY QUESTION THERE. So, stop your bickering, there's no question! The cover has NO QUESTIONS on it... All it sells is extra clues and stuff to the investigation. So, with that cleared up...

The book isn't bad and is written decently if not well. Maybe reading Harry Potter was oodles of fun, but this isn't a fiction story. You have to prepare for it like you would for a history chapter back in 8th grade. This book isn't selling fairy tales, people.. It's selling a bloody theory. And theory doesn't equal to fact, either. It's the same thing Charles Darwin had to go through to get his theory bothered with. He needed evidence; just like these guys are just collecting and sharing evidence. So, second thing cleared up.

I would only recommend this book to a BIG fan. Someone who can die a little to know more about what happened and get some different perspectives in the event. If you think this is just a nice little read on the side, you're terribly wrong. Only buy it if your completely interested
