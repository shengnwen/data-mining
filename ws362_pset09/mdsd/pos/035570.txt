Kapuscinski spent forty years traveling around Africa from the late 1950s to early `90s, a formative period for the continent, when country after country was declaring its independence and breaking free from European rule. The Shadow of the Sun is an expressionist painting of sorts, a collection of unrelated pieces of writing that can't really be called essays for their lack of theme, and can't be called stories for their lack of plot. Still, together, they paint a fascinating portrait of a complicated place, and they give a good historical context for many recent conflicts including those in Rwanda and Sudan. Although Kapuscinski states early on that it is foolish to try to describe "Africa" or "Africans," as there are so many different cultures living on the continent, that's in a way what he's trying to do. And while the book may seem disjointed, it's really an excellent way to capture such a diverse cultural landscape. If there is one uniting theme in the book, it is the historical reality that much (not all, but much) of Africa's problems are rooted in two transgressions by Europeans. First, there is the obvious impact that the slave trade had on the psychology of the people. And second, Europeans failed to see the not-always-subtle cultural differences of the African peoples. Ignorantly, they drew arbitrary boundaries, uniting under country flags people who had nothing in common or, in many cases, were enemies. Kapuscinski offers a fine cross section of these diverse cultures, complicated politics, violent conflicts and resilient spirit of a continent that could never be fully captured in one book.
