When I first heard about this book and it's title, I assumed "Crazy" referred to the author's son's mental illness. It actually refers to how mental health services are delivered in the United States. As an experienced journalist, the author writes an actual account of the realities of coping with mental health care in a compelling and very understandable style. 
There is no one who does not know someone who has had a mental illness, but many do not understand how today's delivery "system" (so-called 'system') mitigates against the effective treatment of conditions which respond well to drug and behavioral therapies. The fact that jails and prisons have become bigger providers of mental health care than hospitals is something about which we should all be ashamed and want to do something about! Mr. Early's experiences and excellent writing make this totally evident to the reader.
I have recommended "Crazy" to relatives of people with mental illness and to those engaged in providing better care and all have been moved and motivated by reading it
