His brilliant sister UCLA professor Kirstin, an expert on ancient studies especially Vikings, asks Navy SEAL Lieutenant Torolf Magnusson what he would change if he could go back in time to an event lost in the annals of history; a little documented event say in 1020 like Steinolf claiming to be king of the Norselands after a ten year reign of terror.  Torolf is happy in America, but would want to stop the madness of Steinolf.

Torolf and his SEAL teammates ride a Viking long ship in Norway when they are transported back to the early eleventh century.  There he seeks the help of his childhood friend, Brunhilda "Hilda" Berdottir, a "Dark Ages feminist".  He and his men find her and other strong women living in Sanctuary.  As his men think it is a big ruse, Torolf begins his quest to end Steinolf's tyranny even as he and Hilda fall in love.  If he succeeds on his mission, Torolf wonders about the future with Hilda, here, the twenty-first century, or will they be the ultimate star-crossed lovers.

The latest amusing Viking time travel romance sends Torolf to the past with his squad in which misunderstanding becomes the norm and the lack of coffee makes the men suffer caffeine withdrawal.  The plot takes many more twists than the previous tales, which doubles the humorous fun as further time induced confusion occur.  ROUGH AND READY is a jocular tale that Ms Hill's fans will laugh about with the antics of displaced people while going over the hill and back.
