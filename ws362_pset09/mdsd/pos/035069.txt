While reading this book I felt that it was possible that the form of the book and the ideas within were at odds. I almost wish Fuller might have reinvented the Book to somehow suit this thought process and logic which seem to work best if mapped out in a less linear manner- more geodesic if you will. 

This book will cause you to question nearly every aspect of the world as you know it, from economics to geology. In fact, you might even gain an appreciation of just how important one is to the other. You may even find yourself in awe of a man with a scope of history (and the future) rivaling that of Marx
