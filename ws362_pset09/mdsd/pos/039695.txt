Being a Texan in Texas during the drought Elmer Kelton describes in The Time It Never Rained, he seems to write about it first hand.  I remember the deluge that ended the drought, and it was the experience  I remember.  I worked at the San Angelo Standard-Times while Mr. Kelton did, and his day to day newspaper work was a preview to his books to come.  He has West Texas nailed down to a T, and I love all his books.  But this one  especially strikes home.
