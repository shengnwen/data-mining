There can never be enough detective novels set in NYC for my taste (I could be bias since I live here). After reading this book I can say that I look forward to reading the rest of the Stone Barrington series. This book is very well written and the story was very enjoyable. Of course the most important thing was the the story flowed,the pages kept turning
