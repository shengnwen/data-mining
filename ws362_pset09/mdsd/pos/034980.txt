Fortunately this is not a teribly long book (about 200 pgs.), because it gets more and more difficult to read as you go through it. There's something about the denial Lucy has of how her appearance has changed, how she keeps hoping the next surgery will make her normal, that gets increasingly difficult to handle. I kept having flashbacks to the movie, "Mask", a not altogether dissimilar comparison. I'm hoping to read Pratchet's memoir next, but I think I'll take a break for a while
