Ann M. Martin graduated from Smiths College with two degrees: one for psychology, and one for children's education. She worked in an elementary school first, where she helped children with problems. This helped her in writing Here Today, for she understood how people with difficulties felt, and the main character in this book had many problems. Ellie's mom leave her and her family to become a star in New York and her classmates bully her. Ellie has to take care of the rest of her family while facing the teasing and bullying from her classmates. I think that this book is very interesting because the main character's reaction to her problems are quite different from the reactions of normal people. For example, if my mom was irresponsible and selfish like Ellie's mom, then I would've had a big argument with her about how she's not responible enough. However, Ellie reacts to her mom's irresponsibility by taking up her mom's responsibilities and becoming a mini mom. Reading a book about someone who has different reactions from the reader helps make the book less predictable, and more interesting.The book is very good because all the things that happen make sense, and the story is very real. For example, Ellie's mom goes to New York because she wants to become famous there, which makes sense, and things like this can happen in real life too, which really helps us imagine how Ellie must feel. Some parts of the story are boring. For example, the part where Ellie and her friends are eating popsicles could be omitted, because it isn't very important, and reading about people eating popsicles is boring too. I recommend this book to people at the age of eight and above who want to read an emotional reality fiction.
