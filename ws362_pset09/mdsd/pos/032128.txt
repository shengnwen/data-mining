This is a fabulous book.  It is a grim but fast-paced tale with the kind of tongue-in-cheek humor I have come to love Cela for.  It may seem dimimutive, and the writing style is spare enough to be deceiving in that  it hardly seems likely that within so few pages, a monument could emerge.  The scope of this book is staggering; only a master like Cela could have  pulled it off.  Go to a used bookstore to find it
