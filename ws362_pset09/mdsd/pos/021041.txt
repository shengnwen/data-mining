Part of the appeal of Burke's Robicheaux books is watching the king-of-self-destruction self-destruct even further.  And Robicheaux doesn't let us down here either, in this gripping thriller, dragging everybody down with him as he goes through his self-inflicted agonies.  But, of course, we all know that he will redeem himself in the end.  Other reviewers have pointed out the counterpoint between Burke's poetic descriptions and the gritty sleazy world in which the book is set.  Also, another reviewer accurately notes that in this book, it's the trip, not the destination, that will thrill the reader.  I couldn't put it down.  Burke and Robicheaux are irrestible.  May they both enjoy good health for years to come
