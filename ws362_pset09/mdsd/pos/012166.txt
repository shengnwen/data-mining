This is a taut thriller from one of my favorite authors.  The plot follows a newly released convict who is trying to find out who murdered his son, a LAPD cop.  The story twists and turns from there,  This is a whodunit that will keep you guessing, especially since you can't put this down.  This would make a great Bruce Willis movie just as Hostage, by the same author did
