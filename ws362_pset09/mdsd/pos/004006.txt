I think this simply is a great book about the Great War. Reading this book gives you a broad understanding of the First World War, the main events and battles, and the course of the war on each of the fronts without excessive detail. Some might wish for more detail on particular aspects of the war, but there are numerous other books on virtually every battle and Keegan simply couldn't have written any more detail and maintained a managable general history of the war. 

One important point, though. This book is not a quick read, especially if you're being exposed to World War I for the first time. Keegan writes in a very terse style, and virtually every sentence and every word is important. You can't skim sections or paragraphs and hope to gain an understanding of what he's communicating. I recommend taking your time with the book and reading it in conjunction with the West Point maps on the war (the maps in the book are somewhat weak). But, if you do that, I think you'll find the experience rewarding
