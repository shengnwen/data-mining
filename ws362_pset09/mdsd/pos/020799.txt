I think some expect this to be "the Intelligent Investor" which is decidedly is not.  But for a lighter modern intro to what kind of thinking is behind value investing this book succeeds quite well.  Enough examples to get the idea across.  And written so it reads easily.  If you find yourself wanting more, then just order "the Intelligent Investor" for your next read. 

But this book succeeds quite well in the areas it aims to make clear.
