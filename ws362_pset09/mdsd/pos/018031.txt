I first got this book from my mom when I was 4.We have since moved several times and the book was so old and worn that my mom got rid of it. When I discovered this I was furious and have spent the last year and a half trying to locate it (I caould not remember the name or author). I found it on this site today looking for another book. I will always cheish this book and have it to remind me that life is better when seen through the eyes of a child
