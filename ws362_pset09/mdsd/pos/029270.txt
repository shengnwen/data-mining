Set in the Balkans in the 14th century, The Three-Arched Bridge tells the story of Ottoman Empire's slow, threatening expansion into a fractious Europe full of squabbling Croats, Greeks, Serbs, Albanians, Bulgars and Turks. In a small town on the bank of the river Ujana e Keqe, a bridge is to be built that threatens the town's very existence by offering the Ottomans their line of attack into Europe's rear flank. 

Recounted by a monk, Gjon, who observes events, the whole movement and narrative of the book hinges on a local saboteur who for a time slows the bridge's construction until he is caught and immured in the bridge itself. At this point, propaganda and legend collide in a most unpleasant manner. While the bridge represents sacrifice, it is also a metaphor for military domination. A book that may have slipped under the radar when published in 1997, Albanian novelists Kadare's The Three-Arched Bridge is a quiet delight that reads like a fable.
