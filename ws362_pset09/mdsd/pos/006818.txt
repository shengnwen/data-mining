This is a simply wonderful book. Every statement is footnoted, with references so copious it is mind-boggling. If he says Jefferson Davis had doubts secession, he will provide a footnote referencing a letter or document to back it up. Considering a topic as controversial and prone to apologia and ideological argument, it is a comfort to have the facts so well documented.  I love his approach to history. Basically, he says &quot; Here is one interpretation, and here are the facts to support it&quot;, then &quot;Here is another, and here are the facts to support it&quot;, and if necessary, he points out his own argument, with facts to support it. The result is that even when he is making his own argument, he clearly leaves it to the reader to decide. I learned so much from this book. I have 30 pages to go, and it's one week overdue at the library, which is why I came to amazon.com: to see about buying it. I simply must own this book. Five enthusiastic stars
