I use this book in a class covering biology and ethics. This is still the only book that I have found that addresses such a range of genetic ethical issues in an accessible way that doesn't overwhelm (or overly bore) students. I occasionally have to give students updates on where some of the technology is now (almost a dacade after the book was first published). In general students find it to be an enjoyable read as well as enlightening. I also thingk it is well written and is especially accessible to those with an interest in genetics who may not have a large amount of background. I wish an updated revised edition would be printed
