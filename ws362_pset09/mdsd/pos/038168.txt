This really is a fascinating subject and this book weaves the story in a refreshing way.  Looking back on The Terror and the French Revolution it is easy to just say, how could these people be so cruel, as on reviewer stated, but you must understand the cruelty inflicted on the French underclass, ninety five percent of the population by the way, by the nobility and the House of Bourbon, there were many missteps by Louis XVI and his ministers.  Many times the Revolution could have been thworted, but the King was just not competent, he had been given a poor education and he had a wife that was Austrian, which before the marriage of she and the dauphin, was France's arch enemy, the whole idea of their wedding, cooked up between Louis XV and Maria Theresa to help unite the two greatest royal houses in Europe.  The story of Louis XVI second born son, Louis-Charles, duc de Normandie, the dauphin, is a tragic one and his treatment, especially the things he was brainwashed to say to his mother, was spectaculary cruel, and the thought that the heir to the greatest throne in Europe, lord of  Versailles, died this way is frankly unbelieveable.  One would have thought that someone could have been heroic and saved this child.  The rumours that he had escaped his death was treated as credible after the Revolution, it was uplifting to many French after The Terror and the Restoration of the House of Bourbon, that maybe the heir had lived.  Honestly, I think that they did not want to have to admit how heinous and cruel it would have been if the dauphin, a prince of the blood, had been allowed to die this way.  Now, with DNA, we know the truth and though welcomed, it breaks your heart, and you can't help but wonder if he would have been a good king, certainly he would have been better than his uncles, the gouty, obese, queen of a king Louis XVIII or the pompous, obtuse, Charles X.
