I think that a book like this should be read by a sagacious [..]. The protagonist's name is henry huggins. He is in [...]and he is not a normal boy. He will go out of his way to get what he wants. He will spend all of his money on his dog Ribsy. I used to read books like this beccause i liked to read about boys my age. I do think this book is worth reading
