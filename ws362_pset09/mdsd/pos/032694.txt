[...]Hard Rain is really a continuation of Rain Fall, and to Eisler's credit, he ratchets it up a notch. Tatsu, one of two people who know where John Rain is and that 'he is,' asks for a favor, sending John back under cover, assuming identities, to repeat his assignment, assassinating a bad guy.

John still has his code, No Women; No Children; Only Principles. Naturally, more develops. It's hard to describe the Eisler touch in a novel because a lot is dependant on what happened in the earlier novels and the facts are all interrelated. I would prefer if Mr. Eisler got away from this for reasons I'll mention in a moment, but by example, the whole Midori, 'love her to death so I'll pretend I'm dead' bit, is repeated here again and again.

There's good fight scenes, well described, and Murakami is truly one bad guy. The relationship with Naomi was both tender and hot. I would like to see her again in subsequent John Rain Novels. Midori is too controlled and would probably benefit from several years of therapy. 

My only problem is too much of the first novel is repeated here. I think I was up to around page 125 and I was still hearing things about Rain Fall. No need to do that. Nothing wrong with a reference here and there; no need plagiarize your own work. That's why I gave it 4 stars versus 5. But I'll read Eisler again, and again. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebur
