This is a collection of short(ish) stories, all based on natural history; some historical (the death of Linneaus) some in modern settings. Like any collection, some stories work better than others - my favourites were some of the historical stories - a woman who disputes the accepted theory that swallows hibernate under water during winter; and a story about a man searching the exotic faraway for new species to make him rich, yet learning much about himself in the process. All have interesting characters and subtly explored themes - the better stories have the themes woven in seamlessly
