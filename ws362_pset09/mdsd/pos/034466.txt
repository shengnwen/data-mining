Homeport's theme is focused on the character of Dr. Miranda Jones and takes place along the coastal waters of Maine.  Enter, Ryan Boldari, a very handsome, exciting and extremely creative thief.  The story encompasses the world of art history and the Renaissance period creating lots of action and adventure as the world renown bronze, &quot;The Dark Lady,&quot; disappears disclaiming Miranda's credibility as a top-level scientist in her field. Interesting dialogue on famous artists such as Michelangelo and their works are just added touches of enjoyment as Nora takes us on an exciting murder/mystery ride with romance and intrigue all mixed into one book.  I was captivated from the very first page and couldn't relax until I got to the end of the book to see how it all played out.  This, in my mind, is the main ingredient to a very good read. Once again, thank you Nora
