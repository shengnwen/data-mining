I came to the Summons after reading only The Broker, and having seen a couple of Grisham films. 

The plot of the book is quite basic - revolving around a law professor's dead father's estate - but contains some interesting twists and turns along the way. There arent a whole lot of characters to get to know, only really 3 or 4 "main" characters, the rest seem to fade into the background, and the Mississippi countryside plays a big role too, as Ray Atlee jetsets back and forth. Atlee's main hobbies in the book seem to be flying a Cessna all over the place and spending large amounts of money in casinos - 2 things I would love to be able to do.

I found the story to be reasonably interesting, as it raised a lot of questions about how Atlee should handle the little extras he found in his father's estate, which were not mentioned in the will. Should he put it in the probate, should he take it for himself, should he split it up? The predicament is interesting, and the outcome of his seemingly altruistic approach does not go to plan.

While the twist in the story is quite unexpected, it is not groundbreaking stuff. Rather, I took it as more of a fable if you like, an example of how the best intentions can look like something otherwise to those outside the thought process.

Overall, I thought it was a short, snappy read. I think that the Broker was a better read than this. If you like the Summons, definitely give the Broker a go. The scenery and characters in the Broker are a bit stronger. But if you like this genre or author, the Summons is definitely worthy of an afternoon or two
