Book #10 in the In Death Series.
In this story you have a terrorist group calling themselves Cassandra bombing Roarke's Landmark buildings.  You also have what appears to be the unrelated brutal murder of a leading business man.  There are many peices to this puzzle but it flows smoothly.  Peabody's brother comes to town and things heat up between McNab and Peabody.  This is a very different story as there are many angles to this one.  A very action packed ending
