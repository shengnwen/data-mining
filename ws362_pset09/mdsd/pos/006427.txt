William Manchester is one of the greatest biographers to have put pen to paper, and his portrait of Douglas MacArthur is another fine example.  The Second World War was replete with genius, many were said to have it; Churchill, Roosevelt, Patton, Marshall, Rommel, Eisenhower, the list goes on.  William Manchester has written biographies of the two most unique men from amongst the many that period produced, Douglas MacArthur being one, and his more well known two-volume work on Churchill.

It is still debated today, was MacArthur the real deal, or some kind of media hype?  Manchester ably fills in the blanks, from MacArthur's service in WW I, to his time at West Point, the Philippines, and on from Australia through to his stewardship of occupied Japan, and later the Korean War.  Manchester leaves no doubt that MacArthur was the real deal, he was of all commanders during the Second World War the most economic in terms of casualties.  Rather than go straight at 'em like Patton, MacArthur out-maneuvered and flanked his opponents in the Pacific, utilizing combinations of amphibious and aerial tactics that others soon copied.  As successful as the Normandy invasion turned out to be, several military historians instead cite MacArthur's amphibious assault on Inchon to be the finest of its kind, as an assault on a fortified harbor was reckoned impossible after Dieppe.  Like many great men MacArthur had his flaws, but it is notable how many who were under his command also rose to greatness, Eisenhower amongst them.  Many of the innovations that MacArthur introduced are still in use today, the Katusa program in Korea (Korean augmentee to the US Army) or the physical education program at West Point.  There is no more thorough or readable account of one of the most interesting American military leaders.
