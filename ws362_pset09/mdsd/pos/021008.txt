I  read this book when it was first published, and recently went back and reread it------curious how I would see it post 9/11.  As most know, Thich Nhat Hanh situates much of his thoughts on peace from his experience living as a Vietnamese through a half-century of colonialism and war.  The book, while discussing peace and other global concerns, more broadly addresses the very practical challenges of living in modern western society.  How do we slow down, be more mindful and more connected to the earth and its creatures?  How do we experience ourselves, in every moment, as interconnected with the whole planet?  These are the central questions, and the answer is mindfulness practice.

As others have noted, he makes Eastern philosophical and spritual practice very accessible to the Western mind.  Whether it be waiting in traffic, or polluting the environment, Nhat Han able demonstrates through his simple, but morally authoritative style how to cultivate a different ethic to counter the destructive forces of our modern post-industrial world. 

Is this book more or less relevant for those seeking guidance in post 9/11?  More so.  A central tenet of Nhat Han's mindfulness practice is a deep empathy for those we have trouble understanding.  What could be more important, as our political and religous leader's use of polarizing rhetoric, only serves to deepen misunderstanding and intensify conflict? His message transcends every age, but is an especially urgent one now.
