For two decades Frederick Barthelme has been turning out an impressive collection of some of America's best short stories. Intimate, funny, economical, and quirky -- and usually set in a recognizable limbo of suburban estrangement and surrealness -- Barthelme's stories detail relationships that almost happen and ones that almost don't, the ways we look at each other when we mean things we can't bring ourselves to say, and the overflow of feelings we all share but can't always, or even often, come right out and express. The Law of Averages is a stunning collection of old and new stories, fully representing a master's broad range of accomplishments, while deservedly winning an audience of new admirers; recommended without reservation
