Piven and Cloward's work will always be useful in the study of social movements.  I enjoyed this book and think others will as well. I don't believe this book should ONLY be read by students and academics but ALSO  anyone that is trying to organize and motivate individuals to take  political action. The authors explain why some movements fail and how  movements change over time which is interesting for both activists and  academics.  Although, a great deal of the theoretical discussion has been  advanced since this book was written, the book still offers relevant  agruements and incites. A similar book would include Tarrow's - Power in  Movement.  Yet, Piven and Cloward offer more historical background that  would compliment Tarrow's newer theoretical work. Last, the topics in this  book vary from chapters on social unrest during the Depression to the Civil  Rights Movement. The book can be read by anyone because the authors give  historical background on all topics
