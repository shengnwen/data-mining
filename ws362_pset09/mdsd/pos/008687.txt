Virginia Woolf does such a wonderful job of revealing the many facets of an individual.  In this book, she applies that task to couples in love.  It is a marvel that she not only identifies the many nuances of a glance, a  word, a movement, but that she also conveys them to the reader in a perfect  sentence.  This book, unlike some of her others, seems written to appeal to  a broader audience.  It is &quot;easier&quot; than some of her other  fiction, but is by no means a bore for Woolf fans
