Little needs to be said for an account, any account, much less a peppy one that reads like a veritable 'soap' opera, of a company that spends close to US$ 5 billion p.a. on advertising alone. 

It is by definition a must-read for anyone even on the periphery of the marketing  industry, and Yours Truly can vouch for the insightful trivia you'll pick up along the way if you hang your shingle in the media circles. 

But the sheer strategic sweep that the authors have packed into this treatise on what kept Ivory afloat (beyond watery puns) will make it a worthwhile read for just about anyone in business. The singular most significant take-away being the allocation of media budgets a century ago versus how things stand today. 

Interesting thoughts and riveting reminiscences wrapped in sprightly prose. Recommended in a blink
