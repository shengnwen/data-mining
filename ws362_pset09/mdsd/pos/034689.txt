This is a 1000 page supplement to other textbooks or courses, and works best when combined with an instructor that knows the material in depth.  Personally, this book was a required text for an intro to theoretical physics class that I took a few years ago, and combined with the instructor's lectures that were partially supplemented by other authors (Boas), I learned quite a bit.

Now I am in graduate school and I am still coming back to this book as a solid reference for bessel (and other special) functions, complex variables, etc.  This book has many problems, a lot of them have solutions, and most of the time you can determine for yourself if you have the correct answer.  I would say a great strength of this book is the difficulty of the problems.  Sure, it will take some time to work through them to a solid solution, but in doing the problems in Arfken and Weber I've found I had more depth in understanding after finding solutions.  Other textbooks will have loads of problems all with very little differences.  You have to actually think to solve the problems contained within this book, which will sharpen your mind for quickly solving problems that you otherwise might not attempt.  At least that has been my experience.
