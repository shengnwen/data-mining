Many counselors and therapists may informally make use of movies to help people explore important psychological issues. "The Motion Picture Prescription" lists "200 Movies to Help You Heal Life's Problems", as the subtitle puts it, with brief synopses of the films, short lists of "healing themes" in them, and comments about the key story elements. 

For example, Solomon writes about "Rain Man" (with Dustin Hoffman as the autistic savant brother to Tom Cruise, unknown to him for decades): "Some families keep secrets that eventually come to light, leaving those who are still alive to deal with the legacy of the family lies. There's no room for secrets in a loving relationship... Can you see Charlie [Cruise] was taking his anger out on Raymond [Hoffman] when he was really feeling hurt and sad over his father's abandoning him?" 

Also included is a chapter with specific, usually common-sense suggestions, and an index of the 200 films in various theme categories
