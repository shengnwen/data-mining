What is it about Texas that sporns this kind of material? There's just so much enthralling music coming from the place, and, like Pierre's novel, it's not just the province of the Big Hats and studded cowboy boots. Hero, Vernon's lot is not a happy one. Yet he survives from his peculiarly south-western hell by an extraordinary flight of toungue, and is saved by the persistence of an unlikely legal ally. Unjustly interned on death row for participating in the mass murder of his class mates, Vernon is reprieved in the 'nic' of time by the discovery of his own shit. The shit is irrefutable evidence that he wasn't present at the crime scene. I can't see Holden Caulfield here. But the ennui of Larry McMurtry's,'Last Picture Show' has now been primed to explode. The liminal zone of Tex-Mex hybridity, familiar to McMurtry and McCarthy fans is humourously evoked. I could summon a number of Altman's films, Solondz's,'Happiness', the astounding desert darkness of Mike Ventura's, 'Nighttime Losing Time', even'The Truman Show' to sound the whacky breadth of Vernon's estate. A cast of obnoxious freaks are perpetually rotating before Vernon's eye. But the book needs none of these supports. the metaphors are original,crisp and lusty. The adolescent dream of escape from a truly ugly, repressive place, where every third place is called Gurnie as is the main drag, has never appeared more welcome. But is the air any less malignant over the border
