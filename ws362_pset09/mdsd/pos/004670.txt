In this book the authors outline unique and useful steps to making yourself financially free.  Using the 'Financial Freedom' number to determine how far you currently are from 'Infinite Wealth' is a very interesting paradigm-shift in most people's thinking, and one that I definitely recommend.
 
Once you know how far you are from financial freedom, you can then work to implement the money-making strategies explained in the rest of the book.  These, coupled with high-quality professional advice, should see you on the path to financial freedom in very little time
