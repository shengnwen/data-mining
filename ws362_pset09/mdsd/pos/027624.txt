If you're a dyed-in-the-wool baseball fan, you'll probably relate well to "Shoeless Joe".  It's the tale better known as "Field of Dreams," in which a wistful young farmer carves a baseball diamond into his financially strapped corn field in Iowa.  The voice which tells him to do it also sends him to New England to fetch the reclusive JD Salinger, then up to northern Minnesota to connect with an aging doctor whose major league career amounted to just a single inning with the NY Giants.  Anyway, it doesn't make much sense.  But that's the beauty of it.  Devotion to baseball--manic devotion to baseball--is irrational at best.  Diehard baseball fans will have an easier time surrendering to Kinsella's version of reality than the casual fan.  But regardless of your persuasion, you'll have to suspend belief for a few hundred pages in order to enjoy this quirky little book.

I have to confess that I read "Shoeless Joe" twice, and the first time through was a lot more fun than the second.  The writing is solid through and through.  But the sappiness of the story grated on me the second time around, perhaps because I knew the outcome, or because I had aged 15 years.  In any case, those who have seen the movie might enjoy reading this book.  But I suspect that the greatest enjoyment comes to those who have yet to discover the story.  And it probably wouldn't hurt if you had more than a passing interest in the game of baseball
