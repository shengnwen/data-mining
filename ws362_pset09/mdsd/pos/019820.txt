This book was our 3rd grader's homeschool reading assignment.  He is a reluctant reader, so it took him a while to finish it.  The vocabulary is slightly difficult for a 9 or 10 year old, but daily discussions about what your student has read helps keep the story interesting and motivates them to read further.
