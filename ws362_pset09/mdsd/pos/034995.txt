I first read this novel in my freshman year of high school.  At the time I was beleagured with comments that she was immoral and not worth a second thought and that therefore the book was rubbish.

Upon departing from that school of thought and watching the movie several more times, I have come to appreciate the beauty of this book.  It is so much more than a hopeless romantic having several affairs.  It is hard to put into words just what this book is all about...but you must read it.

If you are a conservative Christian, you probably won't like this book, you will find her dispicable and the rest of her cohorts.  So be it, stay away from the book if that's your persuasion.  But for the rest of you-- it is an amazing book
