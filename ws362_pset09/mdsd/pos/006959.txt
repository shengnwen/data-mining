This book is abound with breathtaking insights, i had a look at it and liked the title as i was beginning a study on prosperity, because in my life there was a lot of financial uncertainties and believed a lot of rubbish about succeding, from this book i learned to affirm myself and the world around me, as i realised that prosperity is not about who raised you, what your career and level is, but upon the level of faith and spiritual savvy which is easily obtainable if one only asked for it.

There are a lot of other sub-topics cavered in the book with a view for readers to gain transformation which is a requisite to achieving it, some of the exercises are kinder troublesome, like forgiveness, which is almost impossible for a majority of us people, but as we learn in the book, lack of forgivenss is one of the final blocks that can curb transformation.

I also gained a little bit of understanding of some of the concepts introduced in the Matrix movies in this book
