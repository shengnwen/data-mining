If you are looking for an easy to read "how to" get started with creating your own drum circles book, "Together in Rhythm: A Facilitator's Guide to Drum Circle Music" fits the bill.  The material in the book is easy to follow and the included DVD helps to re-enforce the concepts presented. In addition to the material that covers conducting a drum circle, the book also touches on practical business practices such as recommended instrumentation, drum circle set-up and what to do following a event.  Over-all I feel this book is a must have for anyone interested in taking the plunge into the world of drum circle facilitation.  Kudos to Kalani for creating such an excellent resource.
