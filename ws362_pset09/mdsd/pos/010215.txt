I used the &quot;Search Inside this Book&quot; feature of Amazon to try out some of the recipes in this book for this year's Thanksgiving.  I made the carrot pudding souffle, the jalapeno cheddar cornbread stuffing, and the sweet potato wedges.  All came out wonderfully!  The cornbread stuffing was the biggest hit.  I strongly recommend this book
