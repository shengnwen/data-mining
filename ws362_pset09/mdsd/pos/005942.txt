This is the best current book out for pattern drafting, but I prefer the 3rd edition by the same title. It has styles that are more relevant for today. Caveat: Both editions contain mistakes (for example, double figuring in ease) so you should have some experience with making patterns and fitting before jumping aboard. Furthermore, the patterns and rules that are outlined focus on a mass production type pattern. If you're doing custom-fit clothing, you really need apply your experience and intuition to the pattern making instructions shown
