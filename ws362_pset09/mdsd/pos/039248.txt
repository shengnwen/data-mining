Mountain climber Ed Viesturs harbored an ambition/obsession to climb all of the world's 14 peaks 8000 meters high or higher.  He calls it "Endeavor 8000."  This absorbing tale offers a glimpse of the sacrifices he made -- and life bonuses he enjoyed -- in tackling that challenge.  Career and lifestyle compromises were part of the cost.  The book answers the question in the review title above.  

We get an interesting glimpse of how Viesturs approached the dangers of high-altitude climbing in ways to manage the risk.  He strongly disputes the  label of "risk taker."  There are so many ways to die that high up in the mountains, but Viestur's philosophy that "reaching the summit is optional -- getting down (alive) is mandatory" has paid off as evidence by the fact that he is still alive.  His obsessive committment to this ethos enhances the odds of survival.  He punctures the myth that these mountains are ever "conquered."

Yes, at times you may tire of having Viesturs remind you again and again about how he did not use bottled oxygen.  OK, OK ...You da' man, Ed!!  At the end, it gets a little self-congratulatory about all the honors and accolades he received (throwing out the first pitch at MLB games, inspiring the Seattle Seahawks....  His wife Paula comes off as a freakin' saint  -- what with all the stress she was under raising three kids while hubby risked life and limb on the mountains.  

Despite such quibbling, this is an absorbing read, whether you're an outdoorsman or an armchair mountaineer!
