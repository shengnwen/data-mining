My son loves Roald Dahl books and I know that some of the content is inappropriate for a 6 year old but he seems to really connect with Roald Dahl's writing.  He read Matilda tonight before going to bed and around 10:00pm came into the living room balling his eyes out.  He couldn't understand how Matilda would want to leave her parents or why her parents would not even look back as they were leaving forever.  It took over an hour to console our child and I regret not reading the book myself first.  I understand that great books do exactly what Matilda did to my child but use caution with younger kids, I only wish someone would have posted a review similar to mine and I would have never bought Matilda for my son.  While I'm here, he read Holes and was very upset by the child abuse portrayed in that book as well, again, just a warning
