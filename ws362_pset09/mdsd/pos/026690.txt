I've read a few of the reviews on Amazon, and I agree that Snow might have gotten the Nobel Prize for its bold political views. I also agree that there are times when the novel loses its grip. Lost in translation? Maybe, although I think the translator did a pretty fine job as far as the prose is concerned.

However, that said, what blew me away in this novel was the Dostoevsky-like venture into Ka's volatile mental state. Pamuk described it faithfully as it snaked between extremes, through self-destruction and confusion and a desperate quest for happiness. In the end, I was spellbound by Ka's changing state of mind. As a character study, I give Snow five stars.

Also worthy of mention is Pamuk's poetic (and at times unconventional with repsect to western literature) descriptions of Kars, the snow and the ensuing mood. Pamuk creates a surreal world out of Kars, and there were times when I felt I was wandering through Kars myself. 

Overall, definitely worth a read.
