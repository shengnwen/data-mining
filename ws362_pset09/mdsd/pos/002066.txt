This book is full of ideas for teachers and reading specialists looking for ways to help teach literacy.  Even if you work with struggling readers everyday, it's nice to pick up this book, find the section describing the difficulties a particular student has, and get quick, helpful ideas.  I used this text as a graduate student studying to become a reading specialist.
