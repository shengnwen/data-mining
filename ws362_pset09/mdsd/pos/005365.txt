Good usable "How-To" data for the home bound mechanic who either cannot afford to pay the shop rate, or (like myself), would simply rather do it yourself. Good methods of approach with suggestions regarding additional side jobs that could be best completed at the same time and in the same stroke. It fills in the gaps that the factory manuals normally do not cover and applies a good deal of simple common sense
