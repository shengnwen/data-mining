this is an excellent book.It is very evenly distributed subjectively and objectively on subjects that range from ufos to poltergeists to weeping statues and so on.Mr.Dash put in a lot of research effort into this book and it shows.I just finished reading Jerome clark's &quot;unexplained&quot;,Colin Wilson's &quot;Beyond the Occcult&quot;,and John Keel's &quot;Jadoo&quot; and this book was easily right there with them
