This play was also required of me on my 10th-grade English class. Boring, right? Not really. I found the story to be inspiring and emotional and the characters realistic, multi-faceted and down-to-earth. Beneatha's loftiness, spontaneity and charming flightiness reminded me very much of my younger sister, which enhanced the realism of the book. The character of Mama was someone I would have liked to meet in real life; simple and ignorant but conventionally wise and hardworking. The story dealt with both the characters' internal and external conflicts, conflicts with money, lovers and family, which in my mind made it very interesting reading. This book outlines a colorful premise on the life of an African American family and describes their fight for their dreams. 

Schools have been using this play to get students reading and give them different perspectives. I think this book is for all. Some language...but it's not like no one has heard any badmouthing anyway. I think that it is just a really good play too and that Lorraine Hansberry did a good job just weaving everything together. You can really relate to this story with the dilemmas and questions it rises. And it's not like anything of a complicated story either, you can really decipher it. And last I believe the author wrote from her heart, expressing herself through her work majestically and with realistic emotion regarding the problems of the Younger family could easily have struck a lower middle class black family in the 1950's.

"A Raisin in the Sun" shows the importance of family values during times of racial discrimination. The book teaches us a lesson that nothing should come between family ties. It's definitely one of my favorite classic reads plus the film version featuring Sidney Poitier is great as well.
