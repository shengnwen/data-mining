When I was young, Herman Hesse showed us the path toward enlightenment. Oh, the road has often been grim and unsubstantial.  We, who have searched our hearts, believed in tales told to Madmen Only.  We entered alternate worlds and found ourselves, not the Magic Theater, wanting. Not since The Steppenwolf or Siddhartha have I been so absorbed in a novel as Slow Man by J.M.Coetzee. Not 'absorbed', but 'imprinted'. I feel the substance of the man, the silent communion he has with characters, the dialogues between himself and himself in different forms.  The grappling of the eternal questions, the need for cohesion, for what they now call 'closure', and the realization, I think for I am not sure, that the road will go on, if not with legs, than with hands.  If not to walk, then to crawl, not toward death, but toward life.  There is a fusion of artist and character here. The character is real; he at last can be true to his tortoise shell. He will prevail. Perhaps not, this Elizabeth Costello, this gentle, ironic Coetzee clone.
      When you read this book, you can understand the irony of an 'original' Fauchery, a photograph being taken as a joke by Drago Jokic, whose name is likened to a joke by Coetzee, or was it Elizabeth Costello, o, perhaps, it was Paul Rayment? No, none of this is true because this book is mine.
     I will, since I am now sixty-two, sally forth in my humungous tortoise shell toward new adventure. I will not hold my breath to await the executioner's axe or the next calamitous event. 
      Thank you, my friend, you changed my life with this work.  Though it is not considered your best, it is even better because it has the subtle nuance of distance, time, and, above all else, the wisdom of an exceptional master
