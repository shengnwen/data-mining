Ms. Roden casts a wide net and captures many a treasure in this indispensible survey of the many foodways and cultures of the Middle East. If all you know of Middle Eastern cookery is pita bread and fallafel, get  your hands on this book ASAP! Recipes from cultures as diverse as Persia,  Turkey and Morroco are included with many delectables from Ms. Roden's  hometown of Cairo, along with culinary insights from the great Arab food  writer of the 13th century, Al-Baghdadi. All the recipes are put together  in an easy to follow format, with good information on ingredients (though  it does appear that she was writing for a British rather than American  audience, so some of the terminology may not be immeadiately familiar to  readers in the U.S.). Sometimes I think that the book would benefit from  photos of some of the finished dishes, but other than that this is a superb  introduction to Middel Eastern cookery. Enjoy
