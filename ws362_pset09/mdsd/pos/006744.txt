This is a richly descriptive book organized mainly by geography. Cataloging a colorful cook's tour of very diverse regional cuisines. He proves that there is much more to being a traveler, than sightseeing. The differences in geography, history, and culture make up the foundation of a peoples cuisine. From less known wines and dishes to the well cherished ones. What to order and where is all here. The depth of his knowledge of Italian food isn't equal to that he showed in "The Food Of France." Ex: The chapter on Liguria was choppy, and the very chapter titles were not as precise as in the aforementioned title. With France he used names of what the regions main cooking fat was. Here he used the names of historical peoples "Saracens, etc that contributed to the areas cuisines." Still an excellent read.
