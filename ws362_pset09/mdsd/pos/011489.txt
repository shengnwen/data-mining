Garden Bulbs for the South is simply a great book. The vast majority of books on bulbs deal extensively with Tulips, Grape Hyacinths, Daffodils and other cold climate bulbs and only give cursory information about warm  climate bulbs and the information often pertains to container gardening.  Every northerner moving South is tempted to try growing cold climate bulbs.  Reading this book is both a delight and a time and money saver. It will  also assist you in trying a lot of bulbs that you might otherwise overlook.  It has been one of the most read books in my gardening library
