I initially got this book because the mom's group I had joined was going to be reading it, but they changed their mind right after I bought it.  I knew nothing of this book or it's author, but I decided to give it a try since I now owned it.  And I am so happy I did.
In reading this book, I discovered how I can love my children and treat them with respect (yes, respect my children!) while giving them the discipline they need to grow up to be loving, respectful adults.  I was also able to recognize the mistakes that my parents had made with their parenting style that I hadn't been able to understand before, and how I don't have to repeat that cycle with my own children.

Tim Kimmel describes the loving, graceful way you can (and SHOULD) raise your children in such a way that you will want nothing more than to transform your home into a grace-based one right then and there.  He lets you know that raising your children the grace-based way can be simple and very forgiving.  That if you make mistakes in the parenting department, you can ask for forgiveness - not only from God, but from your children as well.  He begs the question: "Why should you expect your children to respect you if you don't respect them?"  He presents the grace-based way so that it naturally makes sense that this IS the way all children should be parented.

This book is packed with sensible, understandable information, but I found it be a very quick read (3 days with a toddler running around!).  I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone wanting a way to parent that is different from what we've always been offered
