The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli is considered by some to be a dictator's handbook. With this knowledge going in, I thought I would be reading a Mein Kampf of sorts. I was wrong. Machiavelli writes matter-of-factly about simply how a Prince should keep power over his citizens. 

This originally was not even meant to be published. Machiavelli wrote it to get a job with Lorenzo de' Medici of Florence from which Machiavelli was recently expelled, when the French conquered it several years earlier. Machiavelli was once an ambassidor to France and was able to observe how princes obtained  power. This was a sample of his knowledge, so that Lorenzo would be impressed. It worked. Another goal of this book was to unite Italy. This goal was not achieved for another 350 years.

The 70-odd pages makes this a brisk read (to put it mildly). 

The book starts off with the various types of princedoms around the world and the advantages and disatvantages to each.
This is followed by historcial examples of princedoms that held power well.
Then Machiavelli talks how a prince should address certain problems such as: how a prince should be looked at, how to get an army together, how to rule foriegn colonies, how to create an image of yourself, how to worship, who you should surround yourself by.
This is followed by calling for the differant city-states of Italy (it is 1510) to unite.

The Prince talks a lot about Ceasar Borgia, his "ideal" prince.

The book may be 500 years old, but it is not dated. This is a great read for any person interested in politics (and you can see  were every dictator went wrong)
