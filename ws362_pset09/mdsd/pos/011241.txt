without giving too many details as it would be too personal, I consider this book a "gift from above"... : it helps people understand WHY they eat too much, and how to get your eating pattern back in control to lead a successful weight loss. Doreen gives plenty of tips, such as affirmations.There is no pretention in her book and it helps people who have been struggling with emotional overeating and who have been victims of abuse,whether the "facts" happened during their childhood or later in life. It's a powerful self-therapy book, highly recommended !
