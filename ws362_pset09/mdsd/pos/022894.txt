Mrs. Piggle Wiggle was 'The Nanny'/'Dr.Phil' of her time.  These stories offer parents and children interesting ways to deal with daily chores and struggles that can sometimes seem overwhelming. I enjoyed reading this book as a child and couldn't resist purchasing it for my girls 4 and 2 to enjoy.  We have been working our way through various childrens' novels as part of our bedtime ritual. Books like this are good for holding the attention of children at various levels of reading and reading comprehension. These stories have also served as a springboard for discussion in our family about finding creative new ways to accomplish the many tasks that need to be done to keep the household running.  Some of the material may seem dated, but it's definetely a classic.
