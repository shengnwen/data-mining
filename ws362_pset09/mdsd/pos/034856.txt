This is a Klutz book,  which wasn't clear to me.  It really is like visiting  museum,  there are things to look at,  lots of different displays (text boxes) lots of pictures,  and tons of information. My 9 year old who does not love to read, thumbs through it often,  coming up with another quirky fact.  He loved the coins from various nations and the rice servings and the hands on feel to it.  This is not a book,  it's an experience
