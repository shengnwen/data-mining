This is my first exposure to Charles de Lint, and it certainly won't be my last. I'm generally not a huge fan of urban fantasy (I admit to being more of a 'sword and sorcery' guy), but this is a well-crafted, well-paced, and interesting tale (more accurately &quot;tales&quot;). It is a story within a story, drenched in the local flavor of Cornwall. The plot centers around musician Janey Little and her grandfather, who owns the one and only copy of a unique book that is highly prized by some seedy and power-hungry characters. We follow the tale of Janey and her friends as they try to figure out what is so special about the book, while at the same time we read along with Janey as she reads the book. A very enjoyable read, and definitely recommended
