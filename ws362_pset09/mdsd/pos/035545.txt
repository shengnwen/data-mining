First, let me start off by talking about &quot;the grade inflation&quot; of most reviews on this website.  I mean, let's be honest, do you really think there are that many books that deserve five stars?  Ok, now that I've gotten that off my chest . . . .  On to my review.  I won't go into detail about Miller's book as others have done this already, and have done a better job than I could do.  So, let me simply make a few observations. THIS BOOK IS NOT HAGIOGRAPHY!  Miller does tell the story of what makes Lincoln a good man, and shows how this helped him to become a great President.  To benefit from this book, you need to have a fairly good knowledge of Lincoln, otherwise you will be lost.  Don't let this scare you off from reading the book.  If you don't know much about Lincoln, or need to refresh your memory, read a one volume biography first.  The only bone I have to pick with Miller and his views on Lincoln and his era is when it comes to Miller's virtual dismissal of the Abolitionist Movement.  I got the impression that Miller viewed the abolitionist movement as a necessary evil:  extreme and fanatical.  What is surprising about this is that Miller doesn't really spend too much time discussing Lincoln's views of the abolitionists.  In closing, let me say that I agree with Miller that Lincoln was a good man, and that this goodness made him a great President.  However, I would encourage anyone interested in this era of history to take the time and effort to find and read Henry Mayer's masterful biography of William Garrison:  All on Fire.  Garrison was also a good man, and a great leader.  Without him, slavery would have long continued and there would have been no Lincoln presidency
