This is yet another excellent book about the Beatles by Steve Turner.  While hard core Beatle fans will be familiar with a lot of the material in this book, it is the fresh writing style and Turner's analytical view of John Lennon's infamous comment in 1966 about the Beatles being more popular than Jesus.  That oft-quoted comment was taken out of context and John retracted it shortly thereafter.  Lennon explained what he meant and the full quote and context have been provided in many other books.  Sadly, that one comment hounded John for the rest of his life.   

In addition to being the World's Best Band, the Beatles were pioneers - they experimented with music; reflected the then current issues through their music and clothing; they affected fashion, e.g. moptops, suits and later, psychedelic outfits.  They were able to appeal to as well as secure the confidence of the independent thinkers; George Harrison's 1965 "Think For Yourself" is a nod to this very philosophy.

As for a personal philosophy, that is a topic open for speculation.  Each Beatle was unique and distinct and very much an individual.  This book takes a deeper look at each Beatle and by describing his behavior and responses, attempts to carve out what appeared to be the philosophy of each Beatle.  

All in all, an excellent work.  This is one the Beatle Literati highly recommend.
