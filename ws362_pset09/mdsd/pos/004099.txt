This nicely written novel by A.J. Cronin (1896-1981) is an excellent entrée into the world of British medicine in the 1920s and `30s, a world in which a character in his 50s can be described as "elderly," and in which doctors specializing in lung diseases are regularly portrayed cigarette in hand.  Cronin was himself a Scottish doctor who practiced in South Wales after World War I and who, like his protagonist Andrew Mason, investigated lung diseases of miners.  Much of the impressive characterization and physical description in this book has the ring of personal observation.

With considerable narrative skill, Cronin tells the familiar story of gaining the world but losing one's soul.  The characters and development are mostly believable, although Mason's sudden reconversion from materialism to idealism takes a bit more willing suspension of disbelief than I'm used to providing novelists. Cronin, although not profound, introduces a number of clever touches, such as having Mason, at his materialistic nadir, excoriate his wife for reading the Gospel of Luke--St. Paul's "beloved physician."
