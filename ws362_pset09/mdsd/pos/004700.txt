I read this book shortly after it came out in 1998.  I can still remember parts of the book and I'm regretting that I sold my copy on eBay for more that I bought it.
The book is nothing short of a book that is simply impossible to put down.  When I read the book it was read in 2days.  If I had started earlier in the day it would have been read in a day.  The only problem with this book is that it is the book by which Pressfield's other books will be judged.  Some have come close and others "Tides of War" have fallen far short.
If it's been a while since you've read a book you couldn't put down get this one.  It's still in the top #1000 books (#674 at this time) and it's been in print since 1998!
