I have been surprised at the positive reception Mental Shielding has  received from clients.  Much of my practice involves employee assistance  and many clients are not the typical consumers of &quot;self-help&quot;  products. I have found that it helped people in all lines of work from the  factory floor to law enforcement, to taking customer complaint calls.  I  recommend it highly. Albert Smith, Ph.D., CEA
