This is a wonderful books that explores women in spirituality and their different areas of spirituality and religion--how they interpreted their Divine Spirit and relationship with him/her/it. I give this book to my spiritual friends--- and is also a GREAT book to read and reflect on in the BUBBLEBATH! If that sounds sacriligeous, I beg your pardon! If I spelled sacriligous wrong, I beg your pardon! It has the gamit of women through the ages: From Sappho (?) to women mystics, to Mother Theresa and Starhawk. Read it and get educated
