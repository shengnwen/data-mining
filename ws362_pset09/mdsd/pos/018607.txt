I am 30 and completely new to the investment world.  This book offered excellent investment advice for even beginning investors.  I totally disagree with the first reviewer who said this book is for the rich.  Even if some of the book speaks to people with a lot of money, it clearly explains what the different types of investments are, defines terms throughout in case you forget what the key terms are so you don't have to flip back through the book when you forget what he's talking about, and offers insite from someone who's very successful at what he does. It's a great guide to start with.  I would recommend this book to all beggining investors.  It's excellent
