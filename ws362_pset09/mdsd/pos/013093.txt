The Boxcar Children by Gertrude Chandler Warner is the greatest book I have ever read. I really liked this book because it is easy and fun to read. I would recommend this book for 4th -6th graders. It is a little bit easy but fun.

This book is about 4 children who are on the street and they find a boxcar and they lived in it. And the oldest brother finds a job in city which is a long way away. They lived in lots of mysterious places like in a lady's place, in a barn and the boxcar is where they stayed. In the end they find one of their family members. The book is good from start to finish. That is how they lived. 

I think anyone can read this book but if they were in 8th grade it might be a little bit easy so probably 4th-6th grade.
