This was a very well done suspenseful tale of the kinds of secrets and pains that occur in families and how the sufferers of those manage them.   In stiff and proper small town Wisconsin in 1919, we learn that Amanda lost her sister, Mathilde (Mattie) through the ice on a winter's eve.  Returned from Milwaukee after nursing WW I soldiers and suffering a bad relationship, Amanda has only a year before losing Mattie and taking up management of the family farm and the raising of her little niece, Ruth.  When Mattie's own husband, Carl returns from war, Amanda is not particularly forth-coming about the circumstances of Mattie's death and the two of them exist in the family home almost in a sort of truce - Amanda taking the lion's share of raising the child.

Ruth and Amanda are the story-tellers and there is some confusion early on about when things are taking place (in the recalled narratives) but eventually the cadence of the story picks up and is not only manageable but well done.  Although ostensibly the book is a suspenseful one, all roads leading to the discovery of what actually happened to Mattie and why, it is also a complicated exploration how people deal with the traumas in their lives.

Very well written, I was only frustrated by the behavioral limitations that Carl and Amanda seemed to exhibit.  There were many times I wanted to shout, "Just say something!"  But I recognize the time period, the ethnic and sociological limitations, and the behavioral `expectations' that these people faced.  And more than anything, I felt sorry for them.
