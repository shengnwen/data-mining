This book has a lot of very good material on enthusiasm and goal-setting and attitude. I highly recommend it for that. However, Zig gets a little preachy when he starts telling us we should spank children to discipline them, as well as his religious views. The final chapter is basically just thrown in to tell you his views. The main problem I have with the book is how Zig refers to homosexuality as a "bad habit" and how he equates "homosexual" literature with pornography. If you can overlook his homophobia, you will probably enjoy the book and get a lot out of it
