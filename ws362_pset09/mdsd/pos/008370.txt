It is interesting how a writer can dive into a gut-wrenching topic like this one and be able to have such a balanced, even scholarly approach.  He must have been on Prozac. I would have like to hear more from Randy Weaver  and Kevin Harris, but, hey, Randy and his daughter have just released their  &quot;in their own words&quot; book.  I would get them both.  In an email  exchange with Randy some months before his new book was released, he told  me that Bock's book came closest to telling the whole story. It looks like  you'll have to add another item to your list
