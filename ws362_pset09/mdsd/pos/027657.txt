If you are anything like me, and read Claremont's more recent work, scratch your head, and wonder if Claremont has any relevance anymore in comicbookland, THE DARK PHOENIX SAGA is the answer.

If you are new to the X-men universe, and want to know the merry mutants at their very best, or your only exposure to them has been in the movies, this is the book that should be first on your list.

Claremont, the writer, and Byrne/Austin, the art team, are as if they were thinking with the same brain.  The result is one of the most breathless, rollercoaster, and truly epic sagas in comic book history.  Cyclops, Phoenix, Wolverine, and the rest are written and rendered so well, you can almost hear the dialogue being delivered.

In short, this is the closest you will ever come to holding a wide-screen summer blockbuster in your own two hands.  You will not regret this purchase
