At the end of this book it is revealed that it was written in a series of letters between the two authors. As much as I like this idea, I can't help but wonder why they didn't revise the manuscript before publishing it. Several parts of the plot seemed to be left hanging because the two authors weren't sure where the other was going.

It was a pretty good read, but there should have been a little more connection between the two stories
