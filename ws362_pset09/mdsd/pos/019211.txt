In This House of Brede is the story of 96 magnificent women and the 1500 year old culture they swim in and perpetuate. It is, true, about the life of a Benedictine abbey for women and the struggles of several novices and fully professed nuns to fulfill themselves as women and as religious women. It is, however, also about leadership and how it is lived. Abbess Catherine, who has leadership thrust on her, stands up to it and shines. Her growth is beautiful. Philippa Talbot, who was a high powered executive before entering the abbey to escape leadership, has a painful growth toward realizing that she cannot escape it if God wants her to use her gifts. Cecily, a beatiful and gifted musician, has to fight to enter Brede and then to grow out of her  misguided experiences as a daughter of a manipulative and bossy mother. She has to discover her own strength and the ways she does it is fascinating.

There are some typographical errors that could have been corrected by decent and loving copy editing but they are annoying rather than catastrophic. I love this book.
