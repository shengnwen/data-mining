John Berendt has a formula - and it works well.

His narrator is a writer who visits a tony town full of eccentric personalities who fit beautifully in their small habitat, but would very likely be outcasts anywhere else. In "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" the characters were often homosexual, transsexual, bisexual or overly sexual southerners of Savannah, Georgia. In The "City of Falling Angels" it is less about sex and more about the perfunctory idiosyncracies of the Venetians -- the artisans -- and their arts which somehow survive amidst their very Italian buraeucracy(ies).

In each book, the writer quickly befriends the "players" of the respective communities and hears the gossip. And, oh what gossip his ears get to hear. In "City" the narrator relays the gossip to us about the horrible tale of how expatriates Jane and  Philip  Rylands convert the Ezra Pound legacy for an apparent personal gain; or how the Seguso family feud regarding the famous artisans sons and their fighting over the company bequeathed to them by their iconic father; or how the numerous fiascos affiliated with the bidding and lawsuits by contractors to rebuild the burned down Fenice are more ruinous than the fire. Each is a sad tale: sometimes  of the best of intentions appearing to have been misunderstood; or, the worst of intentions being understood by the often pessimistic society of little Venice.

Great story line. Great story telling. Interweaving real names with fictional accounts make this tale all the more believable.

Maybe not as great as "Midnight", but few stories are so lusciously layered with characters of such superbly rich and unique quality. But, this is not much worse.

A must read for Berendt fans. A worthy read to all others
