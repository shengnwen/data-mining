The only real negative about this beautiful and compassionate portrait is the fact that there is some newer information that conflicts with some of what is present in this book.  Another edition of the book to address these issues would be welcome, but that doesn't mean this book is obsolete!  It is still a very interesting and well-written account of the life of C. L. Dodgson, the man who would become better known as Lewis Carroll, and this book shouldn't go overlooked.  If you are only mildly interested (or perhaps not very much at all) in the subject, you will likely find that this book is capable of holding your attention until the end.  An excellent starting point for budding Carrollians, but less an excellent *ending*
