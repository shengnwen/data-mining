The title should be "The Joy of Home Fruit Winemaking" as it's really not about Grape wine... it's really focused almost completely on fruit wines. However, most of it applies to grape wine as well. I only give it 4 stars because the title and cover are misleading, but the book is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone interested in home winemaking whether you're interested in grape wine or fruit wine. It's well written in casual style that is very accessible and actually quite entertaining. I felt as though a friend was giving me a lesson in something new and providing insight and tips you probably wouldn't get in a more formal winemaking book or education. Highly highly recommended.
