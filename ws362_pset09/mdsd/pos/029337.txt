I very much enjoyed this fantasy brain candy full of great puns!  Anthony delivers, yet again, a fun book of the 'funky' Xanth, but this time with Zombies!  We haven't heard much from them in the series, but this book has  a very interesting plot that you all Xanth lovers will...well love!  And on  the way you can obviously expect pleny 'o puns!  Enjoy
