I have never written an Amazon review, but I feel compelled to review this book, because of how much it moved me. I read it over 2 years ago and I can still remember loving the first page, and every page thereafter. It is a thoroughly beautiful story about friendship, in particular a lifelong friendship between 2 couples. I know of no other book that explores this topic so well. After reading this I was eager to read Stegner's more famous book, Angle of Repose, which I enjoyed, but which I did not think related as well to contemporary issues and struggles.
