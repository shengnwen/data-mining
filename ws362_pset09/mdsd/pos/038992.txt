This is a well-written story combining the elements of a political/spy novel with those of a Greek tragedy.  Set in Argentina, Greene tells the tale of a botched political kidnapping which provides the context for an interesting character study.  The ineptitude of Greene's kidnappers and their gradual self-destruction, to me, symbolized the disarray and tumult in the lives of each character.  Greene's interesting cast of characters includes a chameleon-like prostitute who tailors her personality to accommodate the varying expectations and inadequacies of her clients, a fallen priest who cannot seem to shed his former skin, a marginalized novelist who is crippled by his pride, an emotionless doctor whose heart is as sterile as his instruments, and an inconsequential &quot;honorary&quot; consul who fails at everything except loving.  This novel is by no means cheery, but I came away from it with an important reminder that life is lived in vain if lived without having loved--even if that love is unrequited
