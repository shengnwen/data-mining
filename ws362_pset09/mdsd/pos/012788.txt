Spiritual wisdom of the heart whose root is compassion. The Dalai Lama is so generous in sharing his thought process on why an expansion of love is valuable to everyone. Love heals in a way nothing else can. It is the force that turned around a Jewish zealot who arrested Christians from Saul to Disciple Paul on the road to Damascus, turned a tax collector into a Apostle, and conquered the once pagan Roman Empire into the Holy Sea. Buddhism has grown into popularity in the West as its approach to love concentrates on compassion to such a high extent that there can only be love left in its wake. A brilliant illumination on the nature of love. This book is for Buddhists and non-Buddhists. We are affected by the thoughts we expose ourselves to, in whatever media they appear, do your dharma and karma a universe of good .... and open your heart and head to the Dalai Lama's teachings on expanding love
