As a child I loved this amusing tale of a mouse who gets to be a flower girl.  Each scene changes with the flip of a half page which I found intriguing.  As an adult, I once tried to find the book and it was out of  print.  I'm thrilled to see that it's back!  Every child with a mischevious  heart will enjoy this book.  Nancy is naughty
