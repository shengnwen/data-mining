Those of us who have a story to share should do so, and this story is beautifully written; WHAT REMAINS is a unique one, worth telling, and would be even if it did not involve America's single most famous family. The details Carole Radziwill reveals are intimate, yet never give away more than those connected and still living would find intrusive. At times her pain is almost palpable, and she seems still slightly bewildered about her life and the tragic turn it took during the summer of 1999. The very fact that she did live it and came through it gives her every right to tell about it, and I am glad she chose to do so.
