This book has often been called the thinking man's Da Vinci Code. The difference is that while Dan Brown is too credulous with the conspiracy theories put forward in his ridiculous book, Eco pokes fun at these theories and the people who believe in them. Eco's second novel is a bit less accesible than his previous blockbuster "The Name of the Rose". There are a lot of digressions that are not really necessary (the most irritating one deals with computer programming, and should really be excised from future editions of the book), yet the book is thoroughly fascinating. The novel's plot deals with three editors working for a vanity press in Milan hatching up a conspiracy theory involving the Knights Templars, who in their imagination, are still living today underground and are ready to take over the world with a mysterious source of energy. Associated with the Knight Templars in this plan, a lot of secret societies also make an appearance, like the freemasons, the rosicrucians, even Brazilian afro-religions (?). Anyway, the problem for the editors starts when some people start believing the reality of their plot, which puts them into deadly danger. The ending is a bit underwhelming, but the book is a nonetheless fascinating view at the world of esoterism and its credulous practitioners
