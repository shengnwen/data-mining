I really liked this one.  It's been a long time since I've read any short story collection, and I'm glad I read this one.  Actually didn't read it, I did this one on audio, there were different narrators for the stories lending different voices and all well done.

Although the theme of hiring hit men was repeated in some of these stories, they all kept me guessing.  Also since they were all with twist endings I anticipated what might happen but didn't often see what was coming.  

This is my first Jeffery Deaver book.  I had avoided them since I HATED the movie of "Bone Collector" but I now want to read some more of his books; I'm hoping that Hollywood ruined a good writer's work
