I am a personal growth coach who sometimes works in the area of sexuality.  Typically, the clients that come to me with shame about their fantasies are women and often I recommend some of Nancy Friday's books about women's fantasies.  This book is different because it focuses on men's fantasies and as such, it is a useful lens for women into male sexuality and the different shapes it can take.

The content of this book is more graphic than Nancy Friday's other books.  Some of the fantasies are extremely graphic and some might say rather unusual.  In other words, you are going to read about some unusual practices and kinks.  On the other hand, it captures the nature of the male's fascination for highly visual, genitally stimulating and sometimes extreme sexual practices.  I thought I heard it all before, but there were some shockers in here for me!

If you are looking for erotica written by males, this is a good place to start.  What I like most about the book is the psychological interpretations of various men's fantasies.  While I don't necessarily agree with Nancy Friday's line of thought some of the time, her interpretations are creative and in most cases plausible.  Her narrative is certainly thought provoking and I like the fact she brought sexual fantasy out of the realm of shame and guilt.

A great book that explains the psychology of sexual fantasy is YOUR EROTIC MIND by Jack Morin.  You may find this a very useful read if you are trying to understand your own or other people's fantasies in an in-depth way.  Also, a good general book on our sexual proclivities based on evolutionary biology is THE EVOLUTION OF DESIRE by David Buss
