It's a lot more fun than the other SAT books/flashcards out there, I must say. As an avid music listener, the music isn't amazing, but it works. The words range from really easy (moasic, parallel) to difficult (the first song - reticence, taciturn, laconic). You can prevew a song on the Rock the Sat website too. 

There's also Vocab Rock, and it uses more than one genre of music - it had R&B and everything else, not just rock music like this book. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm thinking about getting it
