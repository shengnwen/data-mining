"Prayers of the Eucharist" is a magnificant work, much like the book "Ordination Rites of the Ancient Churches of East and West", intended for use, not at the Altar, but in the study of the clergy and those most intimately connected with preparing worship and teaching liturgical history.

This book provides eucharistic prayers that date from the 1st Century (Didachae, Addi and Mari, etc) through the patristic era (including Hippolytus, primitive forms of Basil from Egypt) and right through the middle ages and into the reformation era.  This book stops short of the Second Vatican Council and the modern Liturgical Renewal, but does include valuable material from Lutheran, Anglican, and Reformed Liturgies.

If one is to be equipped to carefully craft the future of Christian Eucharistic Prayer, one must find their roots of expression and theology in the past.

This book will equip the liturgist to do just that
