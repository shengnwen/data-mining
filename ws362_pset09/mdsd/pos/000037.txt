Unfortunately, I missed Mr. Sageman when he visited Europe, but some friends had the chance to speak with him and they praised his work.  That lead me to read his book.  It is a concise and highly readable volume regarding terrorist demographics, recruitment, networking, history of the Salafist Jihad and other baseline facts on the threat.  While studying at Syracuse, I saw how similar Social Science research efforts tackled the myths surrounding other military, guerrilla, and terrorist groups throughout history.  That approach alone makes this book a "must" for any serious library on the topic
