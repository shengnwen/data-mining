Part-time P'town resident William Mann's Wisecracker was the first (and definitive) bio of Haines, on of the silent era's greatest stars and one of its first certified heartthrobs. But Haines was gay---something eh refused to hide---and when MGM honcho fired him. Haines began a new (and much more lucrative career) as a self-taught decorator. His work graced the homes of Joan Crawford, Marion Davies, Constance Bennett, and mega-watt socialites Alfred and Betsy Bloomingdale an d Walter and Lee Annenberg; even in his death in 1973, Haines` legacy followed, with his associate Ted Graber in charge of the dï¿½cor of Ronald and Nancy Reagan`s private riddance at the white House. This coffee table book is the price of a good steak dinner (with wine), but the hungry of film fans and stylists and interior designers will long be satisfied by the intellectual text and more than 300 vintage and rare drawing, illustrations and photos
