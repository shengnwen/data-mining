Silverthorn is the 'second' book in the Riftwar Trilogy ( I say second because it can be considered the third since Magician is broken into two books )  This book is more a segway into the third - not much happens in the way of plot for the trilogy until near the end, but when it does it does it well.  

   I did enjoy this book, but seriously missed Pug and Tomas through the beginning as it began in the courts of Prince Atrhur (sp.) and Jimmy the Hand, though the part that included Jimmy were great.  This story really told itself very well and was quite straightforward.  That is, until we ran into Pug again ( later on ).

   This was a story of love and the drive to save it at all costs.  The prince's fiance' has been poisoned and the cure must be found for her to be saved.  The drive that pushes him on verges on the edge of sanity and he comes close to losing himself in madness, but because of the control that he can take of the situation, and his love for his madien he pushes through even seeing what is ahead.

   If you enjoyed Magician or any other Feist work then pick this one up.  The story is a bit bland and done over, but it is enjoyable nonetheless.. ;)
