I heard about this book and read it at my local library, then ordered it immediately. It's a great manual for the human body and really explains well how food affects your metabolism among many other systems in your body.

Although it can help with weight loss, it's focus is mainly on healthy eating, detoxing, food allergies/intolerances and I used it as an allergy elimination diet. Through this diet I discovered that dairy is inflamming my sinuses and wheat is causing headaches and fogginess, both problems I've been dealing with for 4 years and western medicine has not helped me. I've shoved every nasal spray available up my nose and none of them did a darn thing.

I think that everyone should read this book, regardless of their motivation to change their eating lifestyle. It is truly a manual for the body
