Aisling is back again, along with her pet Newfie Jim, trying to do her best as an antiques courier/Guardian/Keeper of the Gates to Hell but it is not getting any easier.
This book is full of laugh out loud moments and leaves you thirsting for the next installment. Drake is back, sexier than ever, and the fireworks between himself and Aisling are only getting hotter. Set in Hungary we get to see another European country through our heroine's eyes as she runs from one adventure to another.
For anyone who enjoyed the first book, this one does not disappoint and I highly recommend it. It's perfect for those miserable days when everything has gone wrong and you just need cheering up. If this book does not improve your mood, nothing will.
