I am a serious francophile and am preparing to live in France for a few months with my wife.  I have been reading extensively in preparation for our trip.  A reasonable understanding of french verbs will be critical if I am to communicate effectively with the people of France.  I have used and become quite familiar with the following verb books:  "501 French Verbs" and the "Blue book of 555 French Verbs".  First of all let me say that both are fine books.  I will say that the explanations about what the different tenses and moods actually mean are better in the "555" than "501".  In terms of the physical size of the books I would say that they are BIG ("501") and BIGGER ("555").  "501" lists an additional 1500 or so verbs and "555" lists an additional 2500.  

I have recently finished reading the french version of "Bescherelle - 12000 verbs".  I needed to look up a few words in the grammar section in order to fully grasp the ideas.  My understanding of the tenses and moods increased exponentially.  The writing style was highly lucid and direct.  Just the grammar section alone was worth the cost of the book for me and well worth the effort to translate it fully on my own.  The conjugation tables, as alluded to in other fine reviews, simply blow the competition away.  The brilliant (literally and figuratively) verb charts are a masterpiece of organization and memory enhancing devices.  The verb charts alone are worth twice the cost of the book.  Finally, there is the index of ALL 12000 VERBS IN THE ENTIRE FRENCH LANGUAGE.  This is far more than in "501" or "555".  Incredibly, "Bescherelle" packs this punch into a book a tiny fraction of the size of the competition.  This book should be on the shelf of EVERY student of the french language be they a beginner or hard-core linguistic master
