I loved this book - Ram Dass has been a pioneer in so many areas, and now he's leading the parade of aging baby boomers into a whole new territory. I admire his courage, his humor, and his boundless spirit. This book is simply written, yet the message is profound. It was just what I needed to hear at this time of my life.
