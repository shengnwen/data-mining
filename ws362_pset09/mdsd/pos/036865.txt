&quot;...which strikes me as being a most illuminating insight into Keckler's aesthetic. Klee was both abstract and figural; his patterns often evince a network of color schemes that function as a rhythmic facade, that--in Klee's words--go &quot;beyond the associations they produce as concrete entities to function as abstract objects like numbers or letters...the appeal of a poet like Keckler is twofold: the power and giddy energy with which he depicts and transforms reality, and the grace by which he performs such legerdemain.&quot;--John Olson, First Intensity magazin
