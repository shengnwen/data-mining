If you are interested in the experience of companies that implemented the BSC, read the Kaplan and Norton books. Now if you want to learn HOW TO actually DO IT then this book is for you. Instead of selling the reader on the BSC concept Paul Niven teaches the BSC step by step - just like the book title says. I particularly liked Chapter 5 - commonly used measures from each of the BSC perspectives. This is a good book to have if you are implementing or planning to implement the BSC
