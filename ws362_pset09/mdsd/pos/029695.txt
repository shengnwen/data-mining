It has intrigue, suspense, love, betrayal, and twists on every hand, everything that makes a good book great; starting with a princess coming home accompanied by her entourage, welcomed by a king and HIS entourage, and the welcome home party that soon ensued. I absolutely could not put it down. The only drawback was the lifestyle of some of the players and their unnatural affections toward others. This played a minor role, however, and although it made me a bit squeamish to read, it was quickly passed over and the story progressed. Thus the less than perfect rating.
