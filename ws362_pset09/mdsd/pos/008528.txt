The entire Dark Tower series of books are my favorite Stephen King works. I've read them all (several times, I might add) and can not put them down. 

When I first read The Gunslinger, I was so impressed with the difference of this story from all other King books I have read. I only recently read The Stand and I see that this has some similarities but it was a new style to me at the time.

These books are not the typical Stephen King horror stories that so many people expect. This, along with all of the others in the series, deals with the epic tale of Roland, the last of the gunslingers. Roland lives in a world where time has moved on and is on a journey to the Dark Tower in order to attempt to stop the end of time. Each book takes you a little farther on his journey and opens Roland's character to you even more. This epic tale is a wonderful read and should be included in everyone's library.

I have tried to get my friends who are not King fans to read these but have been unsuccessful. They all expect some gory tale (I love those too) and sadly will not give the books a try. 

As for me, I want to thank you, Mr. King for taking me to another world and introducing me to Roland and company. I have never found any other books that I feel so drawn to
