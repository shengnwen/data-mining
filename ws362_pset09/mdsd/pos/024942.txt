This contains letters written by Dwal Kuhl to his disciples who were facing various spiritual challenges with their relationships, world service, health, and so on.  I often feel as if each letter was written for  me, there is so much rich advice in them.  This book is also filled with  short visualizations that will create PROFOUND changes in your  consciousness.  This is one of my favorite Alice Bailey books - Sanaya  Roman, Channel for Orin
