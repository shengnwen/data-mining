In the fourth book of A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket, the three orphans are sent to live at a lumbermill with a man whose name remains unknown throughout the entire book. There, the children are treated horribly, they are forced to work, they get blamed for some accidents committed by another person, they get no  breakfast, they're obligated to wake up very early, they are given gum as their lunch, their dinner is really bad, and Klaus gets hypnotized! The worst part of all is that they do not know where Count Olaf is...but his disguise is a truly hilarious one this time! Buy this unfortunate and depressing book - it's the best! It's "da bom" ! It's great! It's magnificent! It's fantastic! And it's unfortunate! Buy it and enjoy it!!
