As is true of any encyclopedic work, there will be quarrels with what is included and what is not.  Nevertheless, this is a highly readable, well organized book.  It is accessible to scholars and more casual fans as well.  Every college library should have this book.  Stylistically and typographically it could be improved, but that would have sent costs even higher. The essays are well-done and the authors of the essays are respected, knowledgeable people.  This is just a fine piece of work
