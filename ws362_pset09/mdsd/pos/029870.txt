I have never taken a women's self-defense class, but am a committed martial artist.  This book has inspired me to go to a women's self-defense class.  The book is not so much about why women should take self-defense classes, but why we deserved to. It emphasizes in a powerful way that women on not lesser than men, no matter what messages we receive to the contrary.     

This empowerment is missing from my martial arts training - even as I'm being encouraged by good men (and women), there is still the nagging thought in myself (and I think in my Sensei) that when push comes to shove, my lack of self-esteem will sabotage my ability to fight back. Having the skills to fight is one thing, but having the feelings that I'm worth fighting for is another.  

I see it as the next step in my martial arts training to correct that flaw.  This book is a good start, and taking a full impact self-defense course before seemed redundant in addition to all of my other training, now seems essential to my mental training - which is every bit as important because that is what will determine my reaction when the time comes. 

I do agree with some of the other reviews - I would like to see sources cited, and I do think that sometimes the author's passion for feminism makes somes paragraphs longer than they should be.  But, as the author points out, feminism isn't a bad thing in itself, it's been portrayed as "bad" by media and men in general because it's misunderstood, or because it's threatening - this is one of the ideas that helped me, because I've spent my entire life in the "boy's club" and never before had I thought of feminism as anything other than "uppity women", which is unfortunate and now that I see how I've been unfairly judging other women who have found the power and passion to fight for women's rights and freedoms, I feel more empowered myself.
