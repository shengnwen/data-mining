&quot;See just the trees, but not the forest&quot; is an old Chinese saying, meaning to comprehend, and thus evaluate, things only from partial angles and views.  To assess/critic, even compare any one of the 4 &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; novels is to do just that.  The 4 novels are all part of a grand design in a way very much like 4 movements from a symphony.  Yes each novel stands on its own as a great literature accomplishment, but so does each movement of any symphony by Beethoven or Mahler.  Now, I am not a write or a literature critic in any shape or form, but I have read the complete &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; twice before, and am onto &quot;Runaway Horses&quot; for the third time now.  Just want to remind every one that, these novels are not meant to be read individually
