 I'm "glued" to this book...there's so much to learn - it truly teaches the    art of baking and explains things clearly. It also makes allowance for those of us who  use our KitchenAid mixer to knead the dough, as well as those who utilize a food processor. He covers all the bases. Only drawback are few pics. Otherwise, it's a great book
