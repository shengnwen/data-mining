Like "The Names" and "Ratner's Star," this is one of DeLillo's BIG BOOKS--a fat tome that tries to deal with epic themes and dark titanic forces.

I'm not sure any of the three succeeds entirely, but this one is certainly a masterpiece.  Read it for the thrilling prose and wonderful insights into its component parts, even if all the parts don't quite gel.

In "End Zone," DeLillo linked football and nuclear war--in a kind of bleak black comedy.  In "Underworld," he joins baseball and nuclear war--but the tone is much darker and more ominous.

And of course there is the ever-present theme of Waste and Waste Disposal.

This isn't the Waste of "The Waste Land"--a desert of the heart.  It's the Waste of Too Much Crap--overbusiness, overproduction, over-childishness, all in the service of burying one's true feelings.

A brilliant, though difficult, book.
