This is the first Jonathan Edwards book I have read, and the first by a Puritan author.  Of course, the language reflects that he lived in the 1700's, and his writing style is not the easiest to read. His sentences are quite long with many phrases, and I found I had to read more slowly and really concentrate. I highlighted many wonderful passages and will no doubt return to this book many times.  I highly recommend it to any Christian seeking to understand true religious affections.
