If you're well versed in pop culture, if you love the quirkiness of modern day comedians and television, you're definitely going to love this book. Chuck Klosterman flows freely between the genuinely outrageous and the surprisingly close to home for the whole length of the book. His chapter on 20 questions that can tell you more than everything you could ever want to know about someone you meet is absolutely genius. And if you're like me, you're going to love getting to all the quick quips and references he makes, making you feel like you two have an understanding that transcends words on a page.Try reading a few pages and you'll be hooked
