These are reprints of the great tales of the Legion of Superheroes. All are stories that I've read over and over as a kid and now have the chance to enjoy them all over again.  My only drawback to not giving it 5 stars is that they are all in Black and White and not the original color which is somewhat distracting to the reader.   All in all though, really worth the purchase
