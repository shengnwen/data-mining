I only wish I had this book available thirty years ago. Haven't you ever wished that a child came with a direction manual? This is it! It is truly a guide to help parents maximize the quality of time they spend with their children. The exercises will gently impact your children's, grandchildren's lives with christian principals that will last a life time. Makes a wonderful gift for new parents. A must have reference book
