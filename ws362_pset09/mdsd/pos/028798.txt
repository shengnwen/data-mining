This was a fantastic book.  At first, I didn't know what to think of it.  But as I continued to read, the book became permanently attatched to my hand.  I read it in two days.  It is an easy, yet highly entertaining and heartfelt read.  Most anyone can appreciate the thought of spending just one more day with a beloved who has passed.  I highly recommend this book
