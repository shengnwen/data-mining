Another Ludlum gem.This book scores with the wonderful element of bringing a bunch of disgruntled old dogs who served in some of the world's top security and counter-espionage agencies who've come up with an Agenda of their own on how things in the world should be.Very interesting characters and a plot to match.However one of the old boys is not playing by the rules..
