Left for Dead
By Pete Nelson

The book I read for my holocaust bookshare is Left For Dead by Pete Nelson.  The book starts out at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor.  They also sent kamikaze planes.  The USS Indianapolis was one of the attacking ships the US used against the Japanese.  The USS Indianapolis was a very large ship.  Thee USS didn't have tracking systems so they could not tell if there were any oncoming ships or any other Japanese subs were near.  July 30th was when the 74 enemy Japanese submarine was monitoring at 10 knots (around 12 miles an hour) when they saw the Indianapolis 2 miles ahead.  When they made sure it was an American ship, they sent two torpedoes going 48 knots (50 miles an hour) the first one struck the right next to the engine the second one hit in the front of the boat.  The boat immediately started taking on water the boat started spilling oil.  The men started grabbing life vest.  They only had 4 lifeboats men were jumping off.  If the men didn't die from hitting the water, they died later.  A lot of sharks came swarming underneath.  After a few days men started to get 3rd degree sun burns and they started to blister.  They had no drinking water because ocean water is too salty and will kill you if you drink too much.  Men started to hallucinating calling other shipmates Japs and killing them.  They died of many things.  One day they saw a plane around 3oo feet, which was very low.  The plane saw them.  They started to drop supplies.  After the next few days they picked up every survivor.  The men that survived were world-renowned heroes.  I enjoyed this book it gave me a lot of information on Pearl Harbor and what can happen after you don't eat.
