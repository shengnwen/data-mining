Paul Kengor has given us another well-researched and well-written book.  Just as he helped us understand the motivation and success of Ronald Reagan in bringing down the "evil empire," so he makes it clear to us the George W. Bush is a man of vision, integrity and courage who wants to help bring freedom and democracy to those that some feel are of the wrong ethnic or racial group to be able to govern themselves. 
To those who quote the First Amendment against President Bush, if they would carefully read the article they would find that the regulations restrict Congress, not religion.
Dr. Kengor is a young man, and I look forward to many more quality books coming from his pen--or word-processor.
