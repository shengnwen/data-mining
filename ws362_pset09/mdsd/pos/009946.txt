"Vindicating the Founders" does something that most liberals and political correct advocates can't deal with---he presents the facts. As West points out, the founding fathers cannot be critically assessed without their being placed in their historical ephoc. Furthermore, what passes for "freedom" in today's "liberals gone mad" society had a whole different meaning in the late 18th century. Freedom to be gay, have abortions, and choose lifestyles that contradict natural law assuredly were not a concern of the founding fathers. They had more important, practical, and rational concerns to deal with, such as slavery and property rights. Today's fringe element freaks will have to look elsewhere to assuage their compulsion for criticizing everyone who doesn't agree with their childish, undisciplined, and, dare I say, abnormal lifestyles.
