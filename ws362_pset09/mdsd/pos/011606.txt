Mrs. Leonowens is a fine writer. Though  most of here stories have been debated whether they were true or not, it reads as a good book if not a historical novel. Ms. Morgan gives a lot of backround to the author and book and unviels an amazing truth about Anna Leonowens. I like the book  because it was like a small door to the world of yesterday that is dead  with only a faint memory behind. I also like storiesof history.The book is  heavy like most Victorian novels I've read. It takes longer than most but  worth the effort. In this copy we see a picture of Anna Leonowens herself.  If you enjoyed this you ought to read Anna and the King of Siam
