If you are a gourmet chef this book may be far too basic for you but it is great for a beginner like me.  I have two kids under the age of two and have been able to cook a decent meal from this cookbook every night for the past month that I have owned it.  My husband has been very impressed with my new found cooking abilities and all but one of the meals I have fixed has been good.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost faith that they can ever cook well
