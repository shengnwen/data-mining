I was sorry to see this book had such a low review and wanted to add a stronger plus.  It was one of the first quilt books I bought and it got me thinking out of the box.  I enjoy it and still go back and look through it for ideas.  Now that I know Yvonne Porcella's work better, this book does demonstrate a generally more pallid palette of color but it is a good book for a beginner that would like to explore making irregularly patterned quilts
