This is a simply wonderful book.  Although the title may make it seem that it is only for those in business, this book is for high school and college students as well as for those who are ever going to write a thesis.  It should be a primary source of interest to all teachers not only for those who teach English, but also for those who teach math, science, history, etc., who may be a little "shaky" on their own English knowledge. Moreover, this book is funny!  The way Hirsch has written her examples will make you laugh or, at least, smile. As one who was a degree in English education, I can say that this is a book you should read.  I wish I had had it when I was in college
