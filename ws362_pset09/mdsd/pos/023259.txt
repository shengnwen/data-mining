I FOUND THE BOOK ENTERTAINING AND INTERESTING. i WENT ON TO READ THE ORGINAL "PRINCE" WHICH IN IT'S TIME ALSO MADE REFERENCE TO PAST EVENTS. THIS DOES THE SAME -- OF COURSE SOME OF THE REVIEWERS TAKE ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE FACTS -- THEY MAY BE CORRECT BUT THAT IS BESIDE THE POINT, IN THAT I USED THE BOOK AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE MUCH MALIGNED MACHIAVELLI.
