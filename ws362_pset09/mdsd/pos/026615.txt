Be Cool was one of the most entertaining books I've read in a while. This book had a lot of components which made it great. One of them was the message it was trying to send, it was sending the message of how the transition from one industry to another is a hard and adventurous journey full of challenges and events. Also this book has a large variety of characters, form a hip gangster to a hit man with a big appetite.

 I liked how this book sends a message across, the message of how hard to go from two different industries. For example going from the movie industry to the music industry is an eventful adventure. This book told the story about a notorious man in the movie business that was getting sick of the movie industry and wanted to do something different. He decided to go into the music industry and to get a young woman named Linda Moon to start a career and become a star. Through his efforts he met some interesting people who created problems and some who helped him out.

The best part about this book was all the different characters. There was the group of gangsters led by a rich man who runs a record label, they first threaten Chili and his friend but then help him in getting Linda Moon to be a star, they also meet a "wannabe" gangsters who goes as "Rogy" who doesn't want to handover Linda Moon and his homosexual bodyguard who wants to make it big in the entertainment industry. All these characters and more like a Russian mob and a hit man with a big appetite for food. I do recommend this if you want to read a entertaining and somewhat funny.
