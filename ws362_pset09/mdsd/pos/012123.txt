i cried while reading this book. it was so sad when she got shot and when she was in the hospital and the police were taunting her with nazi-esque behavior. it was just a sad story cover to cover. i didn't know anything about her other than to have heard of her name before i read this book, so when i'm reading in the end she all of a sudden escaped from prison i'm like huh? wtf

next thing she's in Cuba! that is pretty holy moly miraculous. i just didn't think it would be possible in this modern day and age to be broken out of a "secure" prison like some episode of the dukes of hazzard, but apparently that's how she escaped, the old fashioned way. good for her! i respect Cuba for letting Assata live there in freedom like she deserves to be living in.

i hope and pray when Castro dies that those evildoers don't close in on Assata. i also pray that those lowdown dirty bountyhunters are met with machine guns if they try to kidnap her after all these years
