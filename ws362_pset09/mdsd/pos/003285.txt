Pitchford does an outstanding job discussing the difference in approach of Chinese vs. Western medicine and nutrition in incredible detail.  Many foods are covered in great detail and recipes are included.   It's a huge amount of information and takes some time to absorb.  My only complaint regards application of the principals.  There is not a clear, concise approach with time line check points if a person decides to implement the Chinese way.  Perhaps that's another difference in approach and more a western thought than a Chinese medicine approach.
