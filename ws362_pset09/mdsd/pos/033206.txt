This book is indeed a chest-thumper and a page-turner!  I recommend it as a relatively quick one to read, and I prefer this one to Richard Marchenko's similar nonfiction action stories.  I think most readers will find Hunting the Jackal written more realistically -- and more modestly, too.  Since the author's total public service spans most of his 70+ year life, we get a wider range of stories than with many other I-did-it soldier books. 

Readers with nonmilitary backgrounds may get annoyed with the several small-scale maps and diagrams spread through the book.  Even though these graphics might seem a little tedious and overly obvious, they really should be stared at for 30 seconds or so, because I know they will add spice to the story being told at the time.  I truly applaud these same nonmilitary readers, though.  I believe they will absorb a wider understanding about the range of really bad people who roam around the world, looking for good people to hurt.  We old soldiers tend to look at things more narrowly; a bit more perspective wouldn't be a bad thing for us.  More books like Waugh's would be good to read.

Hearing the actual story of Carlos the Jackal's capture was very, very informative.  Declassified, I trust
