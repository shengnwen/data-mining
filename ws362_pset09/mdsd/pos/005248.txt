I actually like this book ... and I'm not a novice.  I have studied astrology for many years -- 16 yrs... I've bought many astrology books -- some good, many bad!  While this book is more of a Sun sign book (and I do understand that many other elements are major factors in relationships) it makes some very interesting points and brings up emotional and relationship info that many of my other books do not.  For the average astrologer this book does give you info on Venus and Mars and states how they pertain to the emotional makeup of a person.  

I did notice (as did another reviewer) that this book is definitely geared towards women.  It overwhelmingly refers to men more than anything else.  But again, a good book that has good info.
