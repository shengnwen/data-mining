I'm new to education. This book is very, very well read among educators. Looking at it with my fresh eyes, and with a need to quickly grab useful info for my 1st day at school I thought that:

1) it had very practical advice presented in a quickly read, quickly grasped fashion.

2) I also thought that much of the man's success came from his force of personality as well as from his methods. therefore one's success with his advice would depend on finding a way to fit his suggestions to your own personality.
