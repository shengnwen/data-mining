I always eagerly await the next Amelia Peabody adventure, and this was worth the wait.  Peters had plateaued for awhile, but her latest Amelia tales have recovered the charm and excitement of the earlier ones.  Ramses and Nefret are growing as characters of their own.  Dare I hope that she will start a new series with Ramses alone?  There seems to be the hint of that possibility, but maybe it's my imagination....  An abduction attempt at Amelia in England leads them to suspect the Master Criminal once again, and this year's Egyptian expedition is off to a lively start.  Emerson is frustrated at not being allowed to start any new digs in the Valley of the Kings, but discovers another tomb anyway.  Ramses, David and Nefret are more involved in this one, and both Ramses's and David's romantic interests add an interesting spice to the story.  Wonderful as usual, and if you have met Amelia and her family before, I don't need to explain.  If you haven't, it's time you got acquainted
