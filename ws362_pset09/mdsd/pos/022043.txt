For my entire life i have felt what the heart's code is finnaly scientifically explaining to me.  People believe that it is their conscious' telling them what is going on, but i belive that it is your heart and your brain conflicting between your two options.  i have felt my heart telling me what i need and i have felt my brain telling me the same and i have always followed my heart.  i believe that the knowledge your brain carries will never overpower the capability of your heart.  thank you for finally explaining what i have been feeling my entire life
