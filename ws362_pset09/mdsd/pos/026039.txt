First read as a text for my undergraduate metaphysics class, Brannigan's work is exceptional in its attention to detail and its brevity.  While many authors seem to think the two are mutually exclusive, he breathes life into  Hindu, Buddhism and Taoism among others, without becoming a blowhard.  An  inspired ability to compartmentalize  the relevent and dismiss the  unnecessary makes this work an excellent starting point for the study of  Eastern philosophy.  The glossary is also well above average, and proves to  be a useful reference tool to keep available when reading primary works in  the genre.  Easily one of the superior introductory works pertaining to  Eastern thought
