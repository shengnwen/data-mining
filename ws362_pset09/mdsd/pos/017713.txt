Whether you are an aspiring or experienced producer, this is the book for you. The author packs a lot of information into the 250+ pages. The book is part "motivational," part "how-to," and part "memoir." It all sums up to one of the best and most entertaining producing books I've ever run across. I particular like the author's suggestion that you can maintain your morals and ethics and still be successful in the movie business.
