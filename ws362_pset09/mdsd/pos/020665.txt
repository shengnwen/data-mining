Micro fiction is a great collection of compositional muscle flexing.  Some wonderful, some horrible, each one of the story-lets contained within this book is enjoyable to read, if only for the experiment.  It is as though the collection of authors is trying to "even the score" with the Picture, by seeing how few words it really has to take to impart deep meaning. It may even encourage your own attempt at concise writing.   This book is great fun, easy to put in your bag and short enough per segment that you don't mind people interrupting your concentration on a crowded train.  Watch out, though: it's over quickly
