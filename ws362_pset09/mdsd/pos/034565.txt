I first was introduced to Charlotte Mason and her teachings by my grandmother. You see my grandmother was home taught as it was called back then during the 1900's by her mother. I know first hand that Charlotte's method of education works. My grandmother developed a life long love of learning which stayed with her all through her life up until the age of 93. Karen Andreola guides you through the Charlotte Mason philosophy of learning in a gentle, quiet, friendly manner. It is one mother chatting over a cup of tea with another. I would also recommend Karen's books " A Pocketful of Pinecones", "Simply Grammar" before beginning to read Charlotte's "The Original Homeschooling Series". Charlotte's philosophy of education is just as applicable today for the 21st century as it was 100 years ago for the 20th century.
