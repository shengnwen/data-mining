Home Depot's take on home improvement is to pick common household repair items (e.g. replace toilet) and then go into excruciating detail about how to accomplish it.

This means you could fail to recognize a hammer, and still get walked through a subject matter and feel competent to complete it.

Yet, in other areas, they offer no more than a few quick tips. If you are a bit handy around the house and have done a few projects, this is enough to get started or at least get you pointed in the right direction for asking questions at the hardware store or doing more online research. 

Overall, useful to have around as I am finishing my basement right now and have lots of little projects and lots of questions
