This book was great. I found myself referencing aspects of it to my friends (male and female) after I was done, and dogearing pages to later confirm aspects with my male friends (and sometimes, even dates). Overall, I think its usefulness is tri-fold:
a) entertaining, really quick read but at the same time well written (and interesting from the music viewpoint as well)
b) gave me a glimpse into the male psyche, showing me that men are just as crazy/neurotic as women
c) watching his process of development was useful and very real (so much so that I actually passed the book on to other people as a diff version of a dating book)

I think it's great in that it brings men's views into view, and those are the views I never have access to as a woman. Men I know are never as candid as Rob is with his issues, and I appreciate his thoughts on the whole process, if only to see one of many possible male viewpoints. I think it's useful to read, and who knows? You too might walk away feeling that perhaps guys aren't all THAT much different than gals.
(BTW - the reason i gave it 4 and not 5 stars is that only fantastic mind blowing books I give 5 stars, and this book was very entertaining and fun, but not mind blowing. but then again, very few books are. However, stone butch blues was...
