This book is excellent for anyone who is interested in child welfare and adoption issues. I would recommend it to anyone thinking of adopting thru the child welfare system. She includes stories from a range of families and  presents issues that have impacted their lives and the adoption process.   Stories from single parents, couples, lesbian/gays, disabled families are  well-balanced.  She touches on issues involved in adoption through the  &quot;child welfare system&quot;. Altho she is from Canada she includes  issues from the US.  Great insight
