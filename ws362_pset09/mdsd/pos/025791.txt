I always read books I get for my daughter first to confirm that I got her something right/good for her.  This one is no doubt a winner.  The titles of each chapter were catching enough to make you curious as to what you were about to read and then the story you read were a great explanation to the sometimes funny and odd titles.  The story in each chapter was absolutely great. They were short enough to keep any kids attention, make a good lesson and walk away feeling good that you learned something new and were inspired.  The really great thing is, my 13 year old who usually complains about sitting still and reading because she'd rather be actively playing sports, isn't complaining a bit about winding down and reading this book.  She loves that most chapters are only 2-3 pages each, but even better, she is mimicking what they are teaching and I'm loving it, too, as a mom.  This is a great read, a great inspiration and a lot of the stories are what these kids can relate to.  I plan to buy it as a gift to others, but I'm not sure if I should get it for the parents or the kids
