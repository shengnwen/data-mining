The Yadas Yadas are back again and they are each continuing to grow and learn more about not only themselves but about the God they serve. This series of books continue to be a good read but also allow for your own personal introspection. When I first started reading the series, I identified with Jodi mostly but as I have continued reading (and growing spiritually I hope), I can see myself in different aspects of all Yada Yadas.  Each Yada Yada comes across many of life's stresses and joys but they continue to learn that their faith and prayer can help them deal with and conquer all of these things.  This is a good book and a great series.
