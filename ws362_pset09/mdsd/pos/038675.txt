I read this book for a college English class many years ago.  I just finished reading it again for about the 10th time.  This book is just truely mesmorizing and captivating.  You don't have to Jewish or an immigrant or a female struggling - this book is for anyone that is willing to let their mind enter a time where we have no idea what it was like first hand and to go off on a jouney.  Matter of fact, all her books are wonderful as I've read them all, but Bread Givers is still my favorite.  Sorry I'm not offering a critique of the book, I just simply love it and want to share it with everyone
