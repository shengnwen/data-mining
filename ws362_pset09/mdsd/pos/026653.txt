India, as many misty eyed Indians might claim is a great culture. These idiot savants espouse the greatness of Aryan India: Vedic culture etc., the glorious Hindu period, Buddha, Aryhabhatta, and the Indus Civilization.  What these half wits are unwilling to admit is that to define India is a  feat by itself. Thus,I would argue along with the author,is that the  Persians (Taj Mahal and the ghazals), the Arabic invasions (architecture)  and the English Empire (English, railways and National Unity) are all part  of India as their Hindu and pre-Hindu predecessors.  I applaud Khilnani for  willing to engage his readers in such contentious topics such as the  definition of India and the paradox of India as the largest democracy and  its caste system. How can a country with a large population subjugated by  poverty also have a contender with Hollywood for a place in the  entertainment world. Indeed,is democracy right for India? Are countries  like China,India and Russia best suited for governments with authoritarian  tendencies? Would India have been better if Nehru had not imposed Stalinist  ideology on a primarily agrarian society? Would India be better off not as  a single entity called India but Nation states with self-governing bodies  like the United States? Would the South be better off as a partition than  having an alien culture rule it? Finally, what is an Indian? Is it a South  Indian Brahmin, a Kashmiri, a Sudra, a Sikh, a Malyalee or a tribal person  from the Andaman and Nicobar islands?  Read this book. Khilnani provokes  one, especially those in the West (who think that every Indian is a  disciple of Ghandhi's principles) and those of the nationalistic persuasion  (BJP and the whole wretched lot) to examine of what India means as a nation  state
