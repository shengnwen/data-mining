As soon as Bill Bryson was old enough, he packed his bags left the place of his birth, the little known Des Moines and headed for Europe, he didn't intend to return back home but eventually after many years, a marriage and a family Des Moines did lure him back and with a caustic sense of nostalgia and dry wit in abundance he returned to the land of his childhood, and drove across what for him because the lost continent that perhaps never really existed in the first place...

This book was recently broadcast on BBC7 over a series of days, late at night I might add, which was not a good thing because I laughed so much I couldn't get to sleep afterward!

What a wonderful way of getting into Bryson, hearing it read out  to you, and though he is totally irreverent about the country of his birth, you are also aware that he has a great deal of affection for the land he choose to leave for Europe's chilly shores.

Yes Mr Bryson can come across as being very judgemental about "hicks" "chicks" and we won't say the other word that rhymes with "hicks" and "chicks" but there is something quite charming about the way he rambles his way across the USA, visiting and critiquing places you and I will never probably get to see but he made me aware of a very important fact whilst I was laughing hysterically, for many of us there is a "lost continent" waiting to be rediscovered and I for one will one day go back to the place of my birth, "up north" we call it here an England and I can't wait because I know I will probably feel the same way that Mr Bryson did only on a MUCH smaller scale
