Our country is beginning to awaken to the unfair realities that exist for the majority of people in the world.  This book is a photographic journal of Jeremy and Jena's journey through the most desperate parts.

As I look at it, I am reminded of my own prosperity.  At the same time, I am stirred to move, to love, to give more than I receive.

I think this was one of the most profound parts of the book:

An African man, dressed in a white shirt, was standing in the middle of a typical African field. You can see a blurry mound of sand in the background. A couple of trees behind in on the right and left help frame the picture. By American standards, this man looks what we would call "homeless" by the weathering of his face. His shirt looks like that of a second hand clothing store. He wears a floppy hat to shade him from the sun. His hands are crossed at his waist over the top of a cane that is propping him up. His eyes peer into the camera - as if they were looking right into my eyes. There is a calm assurance to them - something mysterious - almost content. The quote on the neighboring page reads:

"We know that Americans pity Africans," he told me. "But sometimes I think Africans pity Americans.

"How so?" I asked him.

"Americans seem to expect that everything will be provided for them. For us," he said, "this ear of corn is a gift from God. This evening's rain is a shower of mercy upon us. This healthy breath is life-giving. And maybe tomorrow we will not have such things, but our hearts are so full of God's provision.
