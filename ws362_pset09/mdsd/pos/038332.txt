I purchased both the book and the CD.  I will probably recommend the CD to many of my clients who want to work on deepening their spiritual lives and change the negative emotional  reactions associated with events of daily living.  I have been practicing centered prayer for about a half an hour per day for about three months now.  From a psychological perspective the best way that I can describe the experience is from the gestalt notion that content has meaning within a particular context.  By modifying the context it is possible to change the emotional charge associated with a given event.  Centered prayer definitely works at that level.  The more you practice it the less emotionally charged daily events become.  It becomes easier to let things go by.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but I really enjoyed the CD.  It was more focused and made it easier to experience centered prayer as taught by Father Keating
