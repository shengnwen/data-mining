I was looking for a book that would make light reading with some chuckles. This is it! By its nature you can pick it up and put it down anytime you have a couple minutes. It certainly won't consume hours and hours of your time.
I have a relative who is (I think) overly serious about writing to consumer corporations. I bought this book with the intention of giving it to him after I had read it. So that's 2-for-1 kinda? In other words it is not much book for the money, but the value comes with sharing it.
I recommend this book (unless your only friends are 2,200 red ants. LOU!!!)
