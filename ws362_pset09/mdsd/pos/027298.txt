The book is outstanding and i picked up this audio version used, for my car as it doesnt have a CD player. Old car. The audio book is great and the core essentials are all there. Very well done and great for those who end up collecting unread books due to time pressures. Not sure worth it new but got mine for a few dollars on cassette
