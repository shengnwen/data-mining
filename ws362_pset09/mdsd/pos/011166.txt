This novel started slow for me, but once it picked up it was very engaging.  I didn't think I would like the book because I thought it would be about video games.  I was wrong; it wasn't about video games, and I liked it.  To say this novel is about video games is like saying Catch-22 is about WWII.

The author goes in depth on some strange ideas, and a lot of it is interesting, but sometimes it goes too far.  Make sure you have a dictionary handy because Weiss likes to use his "50 point words."

Overall this was a very enjoyable book, and I recommend it to anyone who has a passion for something obscure.
