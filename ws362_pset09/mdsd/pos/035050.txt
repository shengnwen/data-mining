I felt this book was very intriguing, donny definately has a gift for creating rich visionaries of what his life was like as a teenager and through to his young adult years. There is a nice transition into business talk and his advice is directed at you in a comfortable and humurous way. I can easily see how someone would think donny has an ego to some degree, however, i feel the man is just being honest. He's not glorifying his accomplishments, he's just informing the reader of them. Heck, he sold his company for 300 million dollars, maybe he has a thing or two to say and it wouldnt hurt to listen. Great book. But it just didnt have enough bite for a perfect score
