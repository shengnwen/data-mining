Sometimes I discover an outstanding book; this book found me. At the time I was facing an exciting yet daunting opportunity--a God-sized dream of sorts. I lacked courage. Batterson's book infused me with God-belief. His call is to have a smaller estimate of the lions (opportunities) in our lives and a bigger view of God.
