 This new book was a pleasant surprise; 37 essays by Ray Bradbury, all labours of love, and all very breezy to read through. 
 Despite the fact that they are essays, they are written in Bradbury's usual poetic, flowery style which some love and some are annoyed by. Those who are annoyed by it probably are the type of people who never look at anything beyond it's face value and can't stand to watch a film that doesn't include constant, unnecessary yapping, but I digress. 
 The topics Bradbury covers range from the origins of his books, his thoughts on his city (Los Angeles), movies, other writer's books, history, and his friendships (with Walt Disney and Gene Kelley of all people!), and hapiness.
 It helps to be a dedicated Bradburian to read this, and dedicated Bradburians are probably the only ones who'd buy it, judging from the Amazon sales rank, but it's engaging no matter who you are
