Within this tome, a sort of half-information, half-comedy textbook, Jon and his buddies (including Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and Rob Corduroy) introduce the reader to the American government and it's interworkings. With a touch of politics (ok, more like a smearing of poop on the walls worth of it) and a ton of humor, 'America' is recommended to anyone who likes a little sugar with their spoonful of medicine.

PROS
-The book effectively educates one on the basics of the American political system.
-The book is full of humor, and that 'Daily Show feel' really shines through
-The book is easy to read and full of pictures

CONS
-In my opinion, the vulgar language was a little much. No more than on the show, except for the fact that none of it is edited out.
