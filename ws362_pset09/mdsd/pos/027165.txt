Card's greatest gift is to create suspense from moral dilema.  He is also very good at battle field planning.  This book has a good measure of both.
Ther storyline of this book is interesting and well crafted.  It is not nescessary to have read the earlier books in the series to enjoy.

Of particular note is his argument for having children.

Well worth the read.
