The cookbook does the best it can considering the subject!  What foodie wants to give up food?  Not that one is giving up food per se.  Maybe trying one recipe per week and gradually replacing high fat foods instead of going it cold turkey would work.  There's nothing wrong with the recipes I've tried.  I'd just rather be eating foods I need to let go of
