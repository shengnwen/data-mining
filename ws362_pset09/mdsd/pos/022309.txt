Personal Velocity is a dark, stark, insightful and satirical collection of short stories. All seven stories are terrific, but the ones with Greta, Louisa and Paula are, in my opinion, the most riveting and humorous ones in the book. Rebecca Miller has grasped the lives of today's single women down to a tee. She covers all the vital details of modern women -- career, relationships, sex -- with a unique brand of dark humor all her own. This isn't a lighthearted chick lit, but a literary piece of women's fiction. With sharp dialogue, unsentimental language and excellent prose, Miller has written quite a memorable satire. I couldn't recommend this book enough
