This is a fantastic story.  Danielle Steele is an amazing writer.  Not only does she incorporate so many different story lines in this book, they all flow amazingly together.  I also love that it is set in different countries.  I feel that sending your readers on a virtual vacation makes reading the book that much more spectacular.  I too have written my novel "Fallacious" this same way, sending my readers to Greece which brought so much more excitement to the readers.  Also, this book is longer than usual which also is great because when you are reading such great material, you usually say to yourself that you wish it had not ended so soon and this is exactly what Danielle has done by making this book lengthier.  In other words, she gave you more bang for your buck!  Read it
