I didn't like it as much as the Decoy Princess, but still a good sequel.  She kept me guessing about Duncan.  I was never sure if I should hate him, feel sorry for him, or like him.  As far as Jeck, I wasn't sure if he was friend or foe. What bothered me about this is that it is so not orginal for Cook.  Her last series had the triangle thing going on to.  Granted, I like reading the "triangle thing," but I don't want my authors to become too predictable.  Granted, the end was a bit surprising.  

At the end of book one, Tess becomes the new ambassador and goes to sea.  She makes a really dumb decision to invite the captain of an unknown ship aboard and her sister and new brother-in-law (hello? the king and queen, are kidnapped) as well as her and Duncan.  During this kidnapping, she discovers that she is expendable, Duncan appears to join the darkside, and Tess develops abilities that no player can do.

It's all quite action packed and difficult to put down.  I just hate the obvious mistakes Tess makes, but I suppose you can chalk it up to growing up believing yourself to be a pampered princess
