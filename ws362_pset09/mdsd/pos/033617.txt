Greatest thing about reviewing a children's book is that you don't have to read 500 pages.(and there are no camera tricks or canned laughter.) This book is shorter than a short Leno monologue.This reviewer only read the book. Did not listen to audio. Nice illustrations by S.B. Whitehead are a major part of the book. The story shows an energetic father, slightly mischievous son and forgiving father and loveable dog who saves the situation. Good for children and enjoying it can help adults to relax
