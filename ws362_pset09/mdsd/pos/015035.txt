I'm new to this series, so I didn't know what to expect.  This book offers a great overview of myths from different cultures and the historical periods and places they reflect, all with an easy writing style and topical current references.  Although I read it straight through, I think it might be better read a little at a time.  The introductory material did a nice job of laying out the role of myths in human experience, but it wasn't enough for me.  My reservations about the book are not about what's there but what's not there. I'd have liked a bit more comparison and discussion of similarities and common themes and some discussion of what that might mean.  But that was me, not the book
