This a top-notch sports story.  Its characters kept me riveted, its plot line kept me reading and Wojnarowski's ability to intertwine a bunch of different aspects of the story made this book about more than just basketball.

My only complaint is about the editing.  There were many typos, but that kind of thing happens in all books.  However, one grammatical rule consistently went overlooked: the gerund's needing a possesive.  One time is alright, but not once was it done correctly in this book.  That consistent grammatical oversight is the only thing keeping this book from a five-star piece of literature
