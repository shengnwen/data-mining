I found this book to very insightful and thorough. This book is perfect for anyone who is curious about hinduism or has any questions about any hindu Gods, origins, rituals, symbols, rituals, etc. For someone like me, a Indian hindu, raised in USA, with no clue about hinduism this book helped answer many of the questions I had regarding numerous topics. It opened my eyes and strengthened my beliefs and views. This book is one of the several books that I read to discover the hindu religion and helped me make sense of many issues. I recommend this book to ANYONE who is curious about hinduism. I'm hoping that Mr. Viswanathan will write some more books and discuss some of the sections in the book in depth. If you don't get any other hinduism book, get this one
