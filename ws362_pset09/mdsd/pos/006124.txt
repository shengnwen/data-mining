One doesn't usually associate bikers with philosophy - but here are twelve bikers who also happen to be philosophers to refute the image of the biker as uneducated or unthinking. In associating philosophy with recognizable, everyday concerns, HARLEY-DAVIDSON AND PHILOSOPHY: FULL-THROTTLE ARISTOTLE brings the staid practice of philosophy to life, joining others in the publisher's series to attract new generations to a practice often presented as a dry art of past thinkers.
