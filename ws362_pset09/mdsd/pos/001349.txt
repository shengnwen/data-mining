I found this to be a great book for any dancer or child that feel that they are not as good or won't shine as much as someone else might.  Nina felt that her mother wouldn't notice her on stage that she would blend in with the other children. The book teaches us to do our personal best and we will all shine to whomever is watching us!!!!
