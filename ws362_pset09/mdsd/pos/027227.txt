Bill Williangham, Fables: Wolves (Vertigo, 2006)

Willingham takes a small time-out from the big story arc to resolve a smaller one: where did Bigby run off to, anyway? Willingam has been setting this up for a while, and ties together a bunch of loose ends with called-in favors and the like in this entry in the series,  and "satisfying" ends up being an understatement. When Wolves is on, it's one of the best in the series so far. It's not always on, unfortunately (Mowgli's search for Bigby lags in a number of places), but that shouldn't stop you from plowing into this one as soon as you get the chance. ***
