Another excellent book by John Irving. It still doesn't top my favorite "A Prayer For Owen Meany," but this is an extremely well-written novel with well-rounded, realistic, endearing characters. It is a saga, and its characters, like in most Irving novels, are plagued with problems and obstacles and they're not perfect but you can't help but feeling attached to them anyway. A really good read - a novel to make you feel something, to make you think, and to make you laugh. Highly recommended, and I still have yet to see the movie
