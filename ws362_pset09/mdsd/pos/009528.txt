Through my job in the kitchen appliance industry, I was lucky enough to see Bob Blumer do his thing in a very intimate (about 10 people) setting.  From the moment he showed up wearing an AC/DC t-shirt and a pair of outrageous chef's pants, I knew this was going to be a lot more fun than the typical Food Network cooking shows(except maybe maybe Giada's Everyday Italian...but that's for different reasons).  
Besides tasting great, the foods he prepared were just downright funny!  He was very personable and had a great sense of humor which is reflected throughout this entire book.
I wasn't going to give this book 5 stars simply because these are just not foods you can prepare on any sort of a regular basis.  They are mostly meant to be...for lack of a beeter way to describe it....different.  But I reconsidered and gave it 5 stars anyway because it's just so damn funny and so damn original!  
If you are going to a party, get-together or anytype of social event where food will be served, and you want your offering to be the talk of the moment...this is the book for you.  Even if you're not a great cook or don't do such a hot job preparing these bites, the presentation alone will make you the hit!  Check it out!
