As other reviewers have recounted, it is difficult to read this book without shedding tears.  It's a marvelous story of a Russian village's return to church.  The story is sweet without being cloying, the historical context is spot on (yes, Communists destroy churches, kill priests, and imprison believers), and the iconographic illustrations are nearly divine.

But--the author betrays on one page an unfortunate ignorance about Orthodox Christian worship, especially in traditional Orthodox cultures such as Russia.  She has the people waiting patiently in the church for something to happen, and they are SITTING, and then the priest appears, walking down the AISLE.  

There are no pews in an Orthodox church hewing to the traditional mode of worship, as would no doubt be the case in Russia.  

Still, the book is wonderful and worth getting and giving for Christmas.
