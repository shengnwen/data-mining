This is greatly improved from the first edition. At first I didn't even realize I'd previously read this book.
Dana's review of the differences between the various approaches to low- or controlled-carbohydrate eating is so helpful. It made me realize that I've been too strict in the past when trying to do an Atkins-style "induction" phase. Dana is really on top of the science and gives you the references if you want to follow up, and she explains it all very clearly.
I'm most motivated at this time to go back to low-carb eating because of what she wrote about feeling better mentally as well as physically. I have had to admit to myself that I just can't eat sweets and breads etc.; those things are addictive to me and have definitely contributed to health problems (I'll spare you the details).
The criticisms about her treatment of vegetarianism are on the silly side. Dana could have gone into much greater detail about what's wrong with vegetarianism, but she didn't. Instead she chose to accommodate that view and made very helpful suggestions to those trying to be vegetarian and low-carb at the same time. 
I highly recommend this book. I read it in just a couple of days and promptly misplaced it; I bought another copy to give to a friend who has diabetes, but I think I'll keep that one for myself and send him another from Amazon
