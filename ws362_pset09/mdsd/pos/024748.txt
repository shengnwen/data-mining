As mentioned in most of the reviews, the book skips the technical aspects of Adobe for the actual purpose for which the software was written - to improve your photographs. Nowhere does the author impose his rules. He explains his preferences and explains why. It has made a world of difference to how I process my snaps. The book is written for Photoshop CS2 and I use Elements but it still works great. The exmaples he shows are wonderful though the examples on noise are a little difficult to recognize in print. But overall a great book
