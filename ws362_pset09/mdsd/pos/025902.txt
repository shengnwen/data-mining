This is a powerful book.  Mr. Brown examines the life of Guy Waterman, a man who became the personification of the Old Man Of The Mountain.  Guy was an amzing man who workedin fields ranging from speech writing in Washington, to jazz pianist, to winter caretaker of an AMC hut.

There is no hero-worship here.  The book examines Guy's dark side as well; his early divorce, chronic depression, the deaths of his two sons, and his eventual suicide.
