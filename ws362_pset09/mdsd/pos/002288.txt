For most occasional speakers, help offered by a book used to be very limited. I have read a lot of communication books talking about smoke and spirits but, Granville N. Toogood offer us a comprehensive guide, plenty of examples, techniques and rules to apply. Do you think this book can improve communication in our business? My answer is clearly  affirmative after reading the book.
