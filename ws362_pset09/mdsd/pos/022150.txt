I confess. I'm a fan of Dr. Will Clower's, and I enjoyed his other book "The Fat Fallacy" as well as his web site about "The PATH" that is centered around the French way of eating. In fact, my testimonial is included in this latest book by Dr. Clower.

There really isn't a whole lot of new material in this book (except some more recipes) compared to "The Fat Fallacy"--it's just that Will does a better job of presenting exactly what needs to be done to adapt your eating habits to emulate the French style of eating.

And as observed by another reviewer, the French are indeed losing their battle against the bulge, as is most of the world. Even the Japanese with one of the lowest obesity rates on the planet, acknowledge increased obesity rates evident in their children.

So what's the answer? The sensible eating steps outlined in "The French Don't Diet Plan." Follow these simple and enjoyable steps, and you will lose weight and keep it off. This book is easy to understand, easy to follow, with a good selection of recipes in the back.

For us Americans bombarded with low-fat/no-fat ads and media hype, this book is hard to accept. You will want to argue and fight against the notion that eating regular food will actually be good for you. You must read ALL of the steps that include not just what to eat, but where, how and when to eat (and drink)! Incorporate the ideas found in this book, and you will be successful in losing weight and keeping it off. I've been plagued over the years with yo-yo dieting--losing weight only to gain even more back. I have now lost and kept my weight off for over 2 years! And it's all thanks to Dr. Clower and the French lifestyle.

This book is worth reading and following. I highly recommend it.
