Most true crime stories have no hero or heroine.  This one outdoes all its competitors: Jane Alexander is the most extraordinary crusader.  A conservative grandmother living in Marin County, California, she is called to battle when her aunt is murdered and she must fight not only to capture and convict the killer, but to get a lethargic justice system to do its job.  An absolutely riveting, unforgettable tale, I discovered the book when 48 Hours did a complete installment just on Jane Alexander.  I'm not a true crime fan, but this one I could not put down.  Bravo to the subject and writers...Steve, Los Angeles, CA
