After having a heart attack about six years ago at a young age, I resolved to put the disease into remission.  I read everything I could find regarding heart disease, books on diet, exercise, cardiac rehabilitation, stress reduction, and cholesterol reduction...It was less than a year ago that I read The Heart Disease Breakthrough by  Dr Yannios.  The book is a terrific summary of almost everything that I have gleaned from years of reading and consultation.   Significant are the descriptions of  a number of new important blood tests which go unmentioned in even the current literature and are vital in determining the course of action necessary to combat heart disease in each individual.  After reading this book I made an appointment and traveled some distance to have Dr. Yannios review my blood test results and diet and exercise program.  He&#8217;s tough. 	I have purchased copies of the book for my children, for my family physician, my cardiologist, and our local hospital&#8217;s cardiac rehabilitation library.  This book is a must read for anyone with heart disease or a history of heart disease in their family.  It&#8217;s also a should read for everyone else.  Often the first symptom of heart disease is death
