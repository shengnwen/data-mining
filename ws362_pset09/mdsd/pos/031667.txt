Can you tell me who had to survive on their farm during the winter? The only way you can find out is reading the book The Winter Room by Gary Paulsen. Well, it wasn't always like that for Wayne and his family. It was spring in Minnesota. Everything was good for Wayne who owns a farm with his family, but when it turned winter everything went wrong. Every winter Wayne is having trouble. He gets high fevers and coughs up blood. Wayne's little brother Eldon and Uncle Dan have to chop off the chicken's head in order to eat to eat for the winter, while his mother and father take care of Wayne. Then spring comes and Wayne gets mad at Uncle Dan. If you want to find out what happens read The Winter Room by Gary Paulsen. I think the author's message is to respect what you have and this is what Wayne learned because other people aren't as lucky as you. I give this book             for the great book it is. Also it shows families working together.
