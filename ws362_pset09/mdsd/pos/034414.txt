This book is loaded with info on various early artifacts but is mainly for those involved in field work and academia. I wish I had looked a little more closely before buying it. What I really wanted was a pictorial reference with plenty of colored photos. The writing is highly detailed as you would expect for a scholarly reference. There are line drawings and b/w photos but no color plates. Most helpful for professionals involved in the excavation process and for museum curators, etc. However those interested in a general, mostly pictorial guide to early colonial artifacts should look elsewhere
