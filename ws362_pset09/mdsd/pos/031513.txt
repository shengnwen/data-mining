I have found this to be one of the best treatments of biology, philosophy, evolution, and other related issues that is available. Perhaps this is so because it was not written by a computational biologist, but rather by a  &quot;real&quot; biologist, and one who has seen everything since the  NeoDarwinian synthesis that he contributed to. I strongly recommend this  book to everyone with more than a passing interest in biology
