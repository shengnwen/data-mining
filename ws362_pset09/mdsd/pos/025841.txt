While this book is written from Minty's point of view, Buchan brings to the fore all the feelings of the various people that were affected by the second marriage.  You feel the anger radiating from Rose's adult children.  Rose and Minty maintain their icy relationship, and family friends have mixed loyalties.  Rose's successful career and personal happiness assure the reader that there can be life after divorce.  Nathan seems to be drowning in the turmoil created by his two families and appears to regret having created a second family to support and is often worn out by the demands of being a 54 year old father of 7 year old twins.
Love, anger, hurt and sadness are interwoven in a realistic and difficult second marriage.  It is hard to be a second wife to Rose. As Minty matures, she begins to understand how she actually broke up Nathan's first family and will never replace Rosï¿½. It is this maturity that helps the reader to feel compassion for Minty.   While you "Can't go back", and undo the past, you can make the best of a difficult situation.  And things do get very difficult!  A very satisfying read.
