Let's be real, this book is small -- almost pocket-sized.  But that's the whole idea.  This tough little book provides a quick reference for all English composition forms, so serious writers will want to carry it everywhere.  It is a must-have for any high-school or college student taking English composition.  Any person who writes for a living should have this book as well.  The spiral binding allows the open book to sit flat on  your desk.  Its cover is heavily laminated so it can be tossed into a backpack or briefcase without thrashing it too much.  ...And you won't want to thrash it because this is one expensive bad-boy book
