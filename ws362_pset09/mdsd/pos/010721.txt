I absolutaly loved this book I'm 14th and for any other  teenagers this is a great book to read,I watched 7th heaven  since the first showed and to tell If I can't watch I read it.When you start reading this book you can't put it down. I absolutaly recommend this to everyone any age whether you know  7th heaven or you don't
