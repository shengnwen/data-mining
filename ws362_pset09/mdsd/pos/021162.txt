This book unblinds the serious problem that mass media socializes black males (like me), to see whiteness (and therefore white women) as the ulitmate reflection of what is beautiful.  From the moment we are born we are shown millions of depictions of white women as both intelligent and beautiful (from old movies to the Barbie doll).  At the same time we are fed a constant flow of images depicting women of color, especially darker-skinned black women, in negative and often unattractive roles.  The abandonment of black women by black men, as pointed out by this writer, will likely lead to increased caos/ crime in the black community.  Thank you for helping me to better understand this issue
