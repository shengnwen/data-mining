I run a little hot and cold with Nevada Barr's books, usually based on the location of the mystery.  Her device is to set mysteries in and around the national park system and I find myself especially drawn to her books when they're about places I've been (duh!).  I've never been to the Natchez Trace Parkway, and although it sounds lovely, I don't have much interest.  That makes it hard to review this book objectively because the Parkway is a main character.  But the book is quite good.  Anna Pigeon, our now-familiar park ranger is extremely likeable and, as a woman and something of a rebel, she encounters some very ordinary problems in her workplace.  And she encounters some very unusual murders outside her workplace.  The story moves along nicely and there is a real intensity to the relationships in this book - and I don't just mean death and romance.  This is a neck of the woods where not everyone has bought into the Civil Rights movement or equality for women.  And the nice thing about it is that Nevada Barr portrays these redneck jerks without an ounce of condescension.  They are what they are.  And some of them get "educated".  And some of them get away with it.  And therein lies a pretty good book.
