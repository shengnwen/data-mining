Haynes and Klehr tell a story that few acknowledge and it concerns the fetish that many of our professiorial anti-elite have towards the Soviet Union.  These academics lie and minimize, and follow it up with indoctrinating those youth who are unfortunate enough to take their classes at the university.  They recognize that a solid study of communism and the USSR would result students being eternally grateful that they live in the west as opposed to elsewhere.  This may be precisely the reason that radicals distort and relativize objective history.  Kudos to Klehr and Haynes for producing this valuable work.  Incidentally, some of you may recognize a section that is quite familiar concerning the way the left manufacted the phrase "Premature Antifacists." It was supposedly stamped on the army files of those who served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain after they then enlisted in the American army during WW II.  It's a nice tale but that's exactly what it is.  This ruse was merely a way to demean our military. The chapter originally appeared in a 2002 article in The New Criterion and it is an engaging page turner. In Denial is worth every penny
