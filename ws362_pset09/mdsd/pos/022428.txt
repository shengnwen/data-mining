This book starts out in Ancient Rome where Falco gets involved with the murder of another informer and the almost fatal injury of, all people, Anacrites - the chief of the spies who actually set him up to be killed in the last book.  Faclo is commissioned to try to find out the killer and to stop some price-fixing plans that are being contemplated on olive oil - a very profitable product even in ancient Rome.  His commission takes him to Roman Spain (or Corduba).  The story is great fun and gives the reader a good understanding of ancient Spain and the Olive Oil industry.  Falco brings his very pregnant cohort Helena with him on his journey.  What would a Falco story be like without the beauteous Helena
