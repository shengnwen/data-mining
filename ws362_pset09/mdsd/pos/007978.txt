I first read "Management" by Hellriegel and Slocum when I was doing my MBA in 1989. Management was one of my favourite subjects then since I needed practical guidance on how to effectively plan, lead, motivate, organise and control my large department in my organisation with large numbers of subordinates under me. I then found the book to be very useful, easy to understand and logical and I used it to achieve excellent results in the subject.

Some few years after graduation, I was back at the university, being a part time lecturer in Management. I again used the book as one of the recommended textbooks. I have since stopped lecturing and still find that the authors have kept the book updated and relevant to the current thinking and practice of management. For students doing an undergraduate course in management, I strongly recommend the book as it is comprehensive, properly structured to introduce the subject and then step-by-step develop it to the end. As a facilitator, I also find the Annotated Instructor's Edition to be very handy as it covers all the topics that are required at undergraduate level and help the instructor prepare and conduct classes. The various "Insights" are very important in highlighting some aspects of the topics. The numerous case studies are also very critical in reinforcing the practical application of the important and interesting subject of management.
