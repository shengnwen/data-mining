I started this book late last night, and finished it first thing this morning. The writing is lovely. This book opened new ways of seeing my passionate love of knitting, and also sent me off looking at my life, and seeing ways to live with more meaning. I recommend it to all knitters, or people with an artistic, sensual passion and a desire to make things of beauty. If you also enjoy reading, this book will be a joy. I look forward to more of this author's thoughts
