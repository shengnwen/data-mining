I will admit; I have been struggling with body image and "looks" for about as long as I can remember. This book by Kimberly Kirberger helps me to realize that no body is perfect, and that you need to embrace what you look like and have. If you can totally accept yourself the way you are, then you are on your way to success.

After reading this book, I came to realize, and "saw the light" so to speak, about body image, self acceptance, and the search for my identity. I definently think that this book was very helpful in helping me to overcome the "stereotype" that you have to be 105 pounds to be considered beautiful. Now I know that I am perfect in every aspect of my life, and I now love and accept who I am inside...and who I am inside is all that really matters.

I definently strongly encourage those girls who are currently struggling with self acceptance, body image, and the search of who they are, to read this book, and also fill out the Nobody's Perfect Journal as well. This book is very helpful, and insightful, and it will get you back on the right track in life, and make you realize that life isn't all about looks and popularity...rather, it is a journey to love and acccept yourself for who you are
