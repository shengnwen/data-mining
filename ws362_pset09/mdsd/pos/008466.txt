I read this book with great anticipation. I am an engineer and have always been fascinated with the working minds of great mathematicians, physicists, chemists and so forth.  Turing and Godel are two of the greatest mathematical mind of the 20th century and both had very troubled personal lives.  A fictional account juxtapositioning their lives was an intriguing idea to me.  

I had mixed feelings toward this book.  I feel it does a good job of explaining the work of these two men to people who may have never heard of them.  Turing is considered by many to be the father of computer science and Godel proved that there were truths within mathematics that could never be proven.  I would have liked more depth on the relevance of their work on contemporary thought at the time and its relevance to us now.  I think the author was trying to show that these socially disconnected men are forever embedded in the society they never fit into, but it was never explored deeply.

I was also a bit disappointed with the treatment of their troubled lives.  Turing was very eccentric, possibly slightly autistic, and famously persecuted for open homosexuality.  Godel was delusional and, perhaps, paranoid.  I felt the author looked at these men too objectively.  These are lives that demand empathy.

That said, this was an ambitious and original undertaking and I think it was very good effort by a new author.  I did like the writing style and the comparisons and contracts of these two men.  Occasionally, the author uses some awkward phrasing.  Also, I think it will introduce many people to these great, but unfamiliar, mathematicians. So, I can recommend it and I will certainly look for more from this author.

One last thing before I go.  Whoever proofed this book needs to go easy on the methamphetamine or something.  There are several misspellings and unintentional grammatical errors.  I don't normally comment on such things, but this was among the worst I have seen
