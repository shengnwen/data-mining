Chapman has done an excellent job at coming down to the fundamentals of the ways people feel loved. The love languages he describes can be in any relationship, not just dating relationships, but the book focuses on these types of relationships. He gives EXCELLENT examples of people he has counseled regarding how to show interest and affection to the one they want to develop a deeper relationship with. The book help demystify and clarify some of the communication gaps that go on in relationships. It is an easy read, and a book that I highly recommend for people look to improve their relationships, platonic and beyond
