When my father passed, a friend sent this book to me. It helped to relieve some of the pain from the greatest loss I had ever experienced. It does not matter what page you open; it will offer solice in your time of sorrow.I find it a wonderful gift the give friends who are grieving for a departed loved one. I am getting ready to send it to a special friend
