This book makes so much sense, works so well, and shows the conventional color wheel theory to be so flawed that it has changed my life as an artist.Essentially the book presents how to mix colors based upon what actually goes on it pigments, not according to what you think you know about conventional color theory.  If you mix yellow and blue for instance, you are supposed to get green.  Try mixing cadmium yellow and ultramarine blue then!  You get a brownish drab color that can barely pass for green.  Why?  His answer is a revelation that will empower you as a confident mixer of color.  You will learn from this book what it takes artists years to learn thru trial and error.
Anyone who says this book is too difficult or covers old territory hasn't read it carefully. This is the most important art book you will every read. You will come away "empowered" rather that overpowered by color.  

Added Note:(Another reviewer panned the book claiming Wilcox misused the terms "warm" and "cool".  Nonsense. HE NEVER ONCE USES THE TERMS WARM OR COOL.  His explanations show that whole approach to be inaccurate.  I have a degree in science and his science is first rate.  Some reviewers must have read a different book than I read.
