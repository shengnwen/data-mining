Golf is truly great and this book show you how beautiful golfcources can be by the most georgeous pictures I have ever seen. The book is huge and heavy, but the best cources in Scotland/Irland are mentioned. The reason for not getting 5 stars is that such a huge book should really have covered much more. There are just too few courses discribed. The one in it though are probably the best and if you have enough cash when travelling here you are ok
