I think everyone can agree right from the start that "Hard Times" is not Charles Dickens's greatest work.  It is certainly nothing compared to works of a similar length, such as "Tale of Two Cities" or "Great Expectations."  But even Dicken's lesser works are gems, although a bit less refined.

The tale spreads across three households, the upright and serious Gradgrind family, the wealthy blowhard Joseph Bounderby of Coketown, and the dismal, poverty stricken Stephen Blackpool and his wretched, drunken wife.   Gradgrind is all facts, and raises his children to be without imagination or wonder.  Bounderby, a self-proclaimed self-made man is all appearances, having dragged himself out of the gutter into station.  Blackpool is all honesty, unable to commit even the smallest wrong that would bring his own happiness.

Into this mix are thrown two strays, the orphaned but lighthearted Sissy Jupe and the immoral and charismatic James Harthouse.   They are the catalyst for the downfall of the orderly lives built by Gradgrind and Bounderby, and the further descent of Blackpool.  No good deed goes unpunished in "Hard Times," but neither does an ill deed go rewarded.  

Dickens's shortest novel, "Hard Times" is only a small investment of time to spend with such rich characters.   Lacking the light-hearted balance from his longer novels, the short length is a relief as too much more dreariness could be an undoing.  At the same time, a deeper exploration of the lives and philosophies of the storyline would have made for a richer experience
