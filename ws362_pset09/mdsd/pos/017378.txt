Clearly this is a book written by a zorro fan for all of us who grew drawing Zs and playing whips with our belts. It is very readable and weaves the story of Zorro and his nemesis in a very subtle way... pretty much like the creators of Smallville managed to do with the superman legend. 

It does have some flaws, the biggest of which is that the alter ego of Zorro, Diego de la Vega, camouflages the hero behind a semblance of weakness which was very credible for all of us reading the comic or watching the TV show. Even his father was aghast at the dandy demeanor of Diego.  This camouflage is nowhere to be found in the book. Diego and Zorro flow seamlessly into each other and even though the characters match, one ends up with the feeling that the author portrays the Zorro of the last two movies more than she does the black and white hero of the silver screen.
