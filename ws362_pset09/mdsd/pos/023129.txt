The bad news about this wonderful novel is that it is not Ross MacDonald at his very best.  The good news is that it is still far better than most mystery novels that have been written.  Of the three great masters of the American hardboiled detective novel, MacDonald never achieved the brilliant prose style of Hammett and Chandler, but neither of those two came close to the meditations on the vagaries of the human soul that MacDonald made his subject over and again.  All of MacDonald's novels deal with the consequences of original sin, of an evil that seems to be greater than any individual human being, an evil that constantly threatens to overwhelm human beings when they least anticipate it.  Frequently, we discover in MacDonald that, as in the Old Testament, the sins of the fathers have been visited on the second and third generations.  Often in his novels, the roots of the crimes of the present lay twenty or thirty or forty years in the past.  In this novel, Lew Archer at one points explains to his client, "The past is the key to the present," thus stating explicitly one of the fundamental principles underlying all of MacDonald's fiction.  Ironically this novel extends less into the pass than almost any of his other novels.  One of his truly great novels such as the incomparable THE CHILL or THE INSTANT ENEMY will extend decades into the past, which MacDonald brilliantly links to the present.  Often one gets the sense that MacDonald's is revealing the secret history of his character's lives.  This one does as well, but instead of going forty years into the past, he goes merely a few years.

I loved the locales of the novel.  Although I wish he physically described the areas Archer visits, MacDonald was always more of an ethicist than a sociologist.  He was always less interested in communities and the way society worked than in the way that humans worked and how the decisions they make ripple down through the lives of other human beings.  Thus he visits Lake Tahoe, but there is a kind of timelessness to the area he described.  In reading Chandler, on the other hand, there is often a deep consciousness of the character and nature of the places where the stories occur.  These technique benefits both authors, by providing a concreteness to Chandler's stories that is often missing in MacDonald's, while lending a sense of timelessness to MacDonald that is impossible in Chandler.  Most hardboiled writers have tended to follow more in Hammett and Chandler's footsteps than MacDonald's, though James Ellroy is one notable exception.  

Though this is not one of MacDonald's best novels, it is still exceptionally enjoyable.  It is also one of his least typical.  Some people survive you anticipate meeting violent ends (the body count for his central characters is usually quite high).  As always, he unrolls his plot skillfully.  The characters are all vividly drawn.  And unlike many of his other novels, there is more than one unexpected twist at the end.  This is as fine a place as any for any newcomer to MacDonald to start, and any MacDonald veteran who has not read it certainly should.  It may not contain the glories of his great masterpiece THE CHILL (which more than one critic of the genre considers to be the supreme novel of the entire detective genre), but it is nonetheless a very fine book
