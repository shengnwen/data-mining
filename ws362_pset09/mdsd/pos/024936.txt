This is an excellent summary and overview of a difficult topic. It simplifies and explains without removing important detail or obscuring unsolved problems. It's an excellent book for technical people new to PKI, or for manager/business types who need a deeper understanding of the technology. I bought extra copies to hand out at work to people who needed to know this stuff
