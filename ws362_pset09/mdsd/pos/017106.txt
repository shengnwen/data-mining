I first purchased this book to show support for another Flickr member.  I figured it would be a nice book about portrait photography with some nice photographs.  I was pleasantly surprised when my book arrived and I realized it was a very comprehensive book on the subject of portrait photography!

I have to tell you...I think this is the best book on portrait photography and lighting that I've read to date. I have quite a few books on the subject, and I wish this one had been released sooner. Would have saved me a few bucks. :D

The book is well written and easy to understand. It has great lighting setup diagrams, and the best part is the collection of wonderful photo examples. Every other photography book out there seems to have the most out-dated photos! Most of them look like they were taken in the 80s, but these are current and just fantastic.

The book also gives SPECIFIC examples for headshots, glamour shots, and other portrait scenarios which is unbelievably helpful. It will probably become my new photography bible. LOL

Photography is a technical art form, and it's easy to get bogged down in things like apertures, shutter speeds, and lighting ratios.  So many other books out there seem to "dumb down" the technical side of photography, much to my dismay, but this book is a good balance between the two.  I highly recommend it to anyone out there who's interested in portrait photography.

Many thanks to Catherine and everyone else who helped out with the book! It's wonderful. :
