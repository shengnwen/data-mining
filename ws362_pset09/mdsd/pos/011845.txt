This is an interesting history and account of Krakatoa and the 1883 explosion. Much of the book is interesting and readable. In particular, Mr. Winchester makes the geology accessible, and even fun, for non-scientists. However, I felt Mr. Winchester did not do as well with the historical accounts. This seems more because he tries to cover so much history than anything else. The book is best when it focuses on the volcano itself, not the people. Besides this, it is still a great read, and I would definitely recommend it
