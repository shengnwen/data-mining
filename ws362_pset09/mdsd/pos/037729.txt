The real reason I purchased Public Relations Kit for Dummies, is for my interest of pursuing a career in publicity.  All of the Dummies Series books that I've read are based on the fact of the readers being at "beginning level."  I like that, because it allows us that don't have the experience or knowledge, gain more insight and wisdom on the particular subject.  If you are a intermediate or very experienced PR professional, maybe you shouldn't purchase it.  But I find the works of Eric Yaverbaum and Bob Bly, really great.  I'm happy with my book, and plan on keeping it on my desk!  Thank you..
