I am extrememly glad that I brought this book not long after returning to the martial arts after many years away.  It allowed me to improve my kata and stance work at a much faster rate than I had thought possible.  Practicing in front of a large mirror at my local gym also helped.
One has to remember that you really do need a good Sensei to look at and correct imperfections in your technique but this book goes a long way to moving the process along
