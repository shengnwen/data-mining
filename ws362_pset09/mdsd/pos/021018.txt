This book is one of those rare works that combines passionate engagement with a universal issue, artful storytelling, and clinical expertise.  The author allows each of the patients he describes to bless him, and thereby  to bless the reader. Dying, the author argues, is not simply a holding  pattern between life and death.  It is a vital developmental time that  holds infinite possiblities for deepening, learning to love, serving one  another both as caregiver and receiver of care, and simply learning to  &quot;be&quot; after what often has been a lifetime of mechanistic  &quot;doing.&quot;  Such possibility is created when simple principles of  Hospice are honored. Pain must be absolutely controlled.  The patient (and  the family) must be tenderly companioned. Such care, the author convinces  us, is a privilege, a holy time in which human beings gather together in  the face of Mystery in all of its agony and joy and wonder and transcendent  meaning.  We can only create human community, the author suggests, when we  are willing to simultaneously look death in the face and to remain open to  the gift of healing.  I closed the book more alive, more thankful, less  fearful, and more curious about the prospect of the adventures ahead
