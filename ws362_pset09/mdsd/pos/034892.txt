Carlyle is not properly a historian or a philosopher, but a moralist, a fervent admirer of excellence, and a prose-poet of the first rank.  Six meditations deal respectively of the hero as: Divinity, Prophet, Poet,  Priest, Man of Letters, and King.  If this book can't rightly be shelved  with philosophy or history, it belongs in Literature with a capital  &quot;L,&quot; and Poetry.  Carlylye loved the English Language and used it  masterfully, energetically, and reverentially, without a trace of the  trivial overindulgence of self-conscious and self-absorbed  &quot;poets.&quot
