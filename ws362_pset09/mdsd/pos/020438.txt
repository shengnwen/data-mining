This book explains the functioning of the ultra-secret spy organization, the National Security Agency (NSA = No Such Agency), in a more or less hagiographic way: its enormous budget (equals a Fortune 50 company), its employees (still a shortage of linguists), its recruitment system, its information storage capacity (5 trillion pages, 1.6 million data tapes, of which some are kept eternally), its information gathering (can intercept electronic mail sent by Cisco routers, a former Cisco engineer is an NSA technical advisor), its computer brain.

The author criticizes the NSA for eavesdropping on the international communications of US citizens (already in 1975!) and for spying on US citizens (protests against the Vietnam war).
Its ultra-secrecy can create Kafkaeske situations: an immigrant was arrested and put illegally in solitary confinement for three years without knowing exactly why (the reason was a secret).

The author is heavily critical for the military ('Restless from a decade of peace, out of touch with reality, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were desperate for a war, any war.') and for the Pentagon, because it deceives the public ('trumping up wars for Americans to fight and die was standard, approved policy at the highest levels of the Pentagon.')
These authorities together with intelligence agencies created or proposed to create incidents to provoke war (the Tonkin Gulf incident, the Pueblo affair or operation Northwoods - a proposition to organize a secret campaign of terrorism within the US in order to blame Castro!).

James Bamford's work contains excellent information but it is far too detailed (e.g. the USS Liberty affair) and far too long
