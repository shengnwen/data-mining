This was my first novel that I have read by Bharati Mukherjee and I found it difficult to read sometimes.  There are parts in the beginning of the story that are hard to understand but once you read through the novel everything starts to make sense to you.  Mukhejee tends to skip around throughout the novel and this causes it to become confusing.  
	The story deals with Jasmine trying to deal with the past in order to move on with the future.  She has trouble dealing with her past because she has survived so many traumatic situations in her life.  She also does not know how to do deal with the past and tends to carry it along with her.  
	 Mukherjee had great themes throughout the story.  I found that one of the themes was finding your true identity in a chaotic world.  Jasmine goes through many names throughout the story including Jyoti, Jazzy, Jane, and Jase.  Her life becomes very chaotic because she has to go from place to place trying to find out who she wants to be in the American world.  Another theme that I found intriguing was that we are never satisfied with what we have.  Throughout this story Jasmine always wants more.  She wants the American lifestyle and in the end we see that.  She has the right to choose Bud who she will have a laid back lifestyle and many people believe that he represents the Indian culture or she can choose Taylor who will give her an adventurous lifestyle.  She has to choose whether she is happy with what she has with Bud or does she want more.    
	I enjoyed the story overall because she caught my attention with her vivid descriptions in her scenes.  The one scene that always sticks out in my mind is when she compares the room where she murdered her rapist to a slaughter house.  She used great vivid details to describe the stabbing.
