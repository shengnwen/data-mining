I must say i enjoyed book 3 much more so then book 2.  This was a fun tale from start to finish.  In this story, Artemis decides to embark on one final criminal activity, which only entails taking down a large and notoriously bad IT mogul.  During the process, everything that could go wrong does!  And once again Artemis needs the help of the fairies.  This book takes off with great speed and is much more adventurous then the previous book.  

I throughly enjoyed this book, it was a fun tale and i look forward to reading book 4.  I think that if you have enjoyed the first 2 books then you will certainly enjoy this one.  4 stars for the excitement and drama in this book.  Once again, i feel like a kid again everytime i read Colfer's books.  He is a great author that grows with experience.  

Have fun reading this book
