I was a little bit disappointed by the first book (The Fire Within) since the cover promised us a story about dragons but none was seen. However, I really enjoyed the style and the spirit among the characters. That alone drove me to order (Icefire) and I have to say the story really starts here not in the first book.

The Fire within was almost about squirrels, which made it kind of silly for me as an adult reader. But in Icefire you get to know a lot about the dragons and the bears. The plot is much more intense and thrilling, new characters appear and the story broadens a lot.

You may notice that many things were mentioned in The Fire Within and you get confused about some names and details but you'll be safe when you continue so don't worry about it
