I have just finished reading "Culture Warrior" and I was pleased with the format and felt it informative and useful. I did feel that there could have been more about the "culture war" and less about the war against Bill. Often when Mr. O'Reilly was making a valid point he would drift off for a paragraph or two, mostly regarding some trash talking someone else directed towards him. 
Otherwise the information provided is certainly an eye-opener for anyone who may not be informed on some very important issues. I think this book should be read and considered by everyone, regardless of your political stance.
