I have seen several scathing reviews here, based on the fact this text is not Math Intensive; but that is exactly the point of the book!  I can teach kids who previously had little interest in the sciences and none in Physics, and suck 'em right on in to the beauty of understanding how the world works.  We can then progress to other resources for "Problem Solving".  

I agree that by itself, this is not adequate preparation for the AP Exams.  It does, however, provide the framework for understanding what we are working toward, and getting the attention of the non- "Math-head" students, so they can see some point to the science.  Since many, many adolescents have a hard time applying themselves to subject matter which seems purely theoretical, this an invaulable service.

I believe every student should start with Conceptual Physics.  Every educated person should have some basic understanding of these ideas, even if he or she is a (gasp!) Liberal Arts type.  Those who wish to pursue engineering, obviously, should then progress further, with a more mathematically challenging follow-on text.
