What a beautiful and tragic story. It is a short book, but the pages packed. I found myself wanting to race to find out what happened and how the story would reveal itself, but at the same time wanting to savor slowly the images created by the writing. Characters all richly fleshed out, shaped by sorrow. I shall have to go back and read this again, for the pieces I know I rushed past. This could have been a totally maudlin tale, but is instead skillfully told. Lucy, her parents, Ralph, Bridget and her husband Henry (who had the one line in the book that made me laugh out loud--"As often it was, his face was empty of expression even when he spoke. 'More happens in a ham,' Bridget's father had once said about Henry's face." I read that and hooted, for it's exactly as I had pictured him.)

This book was Shortlisted for the Booker Prize. I need to go see what beat it out that year
