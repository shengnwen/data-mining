 

Sighing, rustling, the sounds of sleep; a torrent of sensations surround the reader from the start in this stunning fiction, a remarkable debut, assaulting with images of Reubanesque shapes, the sweet, slightly rancid taste of butter, "dirty children with fat melting in their fists." It is poetry, barely disguised, metaphor unbridled.

It is impossible to describe such a novel, draped with concupiscent women and gaunt saints, unabashedly erotic, cautionary and fearless, a celebration of inventiveness. All is larger than life, most especially flesh-draped bodies, but also the tragi-comedic range of emotions, of extremes. Myriad images and sensory impressions thread one to another, weaving fragments of thought into whole cloth. 

Imagination, morality, Eros and ambiguity lie side by side, contentedly coexisting. The uniquely talented Sarah Shun-Lien Bynam has given an hour or two the transcendence of immortality. Madeline Is Sleeping is a highly personal journey, one that can only be appreciated through the experience. If my words do not make sense, it is because they are mine; like a dream, each person must recognize his own reflection. Luan Gaines/2004
