I rarely post on the Internet because it starts too many rumors, but I have to reply to the review by John from CA. Not only is BLUE CHRISTMAS a bold and amusing book of anecdotes about my life, but it is all true. I do haunt the hallways of the Original Heartbreak Hotel in Memphis, and I do on occasion don a Santa suit and sing  'Can't Help Falling in Love' on street corners. Although I am officially retired and lead a much quieter life, I want readers to know that Elvis is alive and well. The problem is that everyone is looking for me at Graceland. Read BLUE CHRISTMAS and you'll learn where I'm really spending my jumpsuited golden years.  Thank you very much
