I read this book and the sequel, People of the Lie around the time that they came out.  I was stunned by Peck's honesty. The stories of how he and his patients struggle with the problems and obstacles that confront them are amazing.

We don't want to hear that life is difficult. We want to buy something, toothpaste, hair dye, a new car, or find a new relationship that will make things easy for us.

Whenever I need some encouragement, I just find these books on my book shelf
