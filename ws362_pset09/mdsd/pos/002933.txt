This review is for the Warner Books First U.S. Paperback edition, November 1996, 505 pages.  ABSOLUTE POWER was on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list for 54 weeks in 1996 and 1997, reaching the peak position of number three.

The opening scenes in ABSOLUTE POWER initiate a clever, imaginative plot.  Luther Whitney, an experienced burglar in his late middle years, stealthy enters the master bedroom of an opulent mansion after disarming a sophisticated alarm system.  Possessing inside information, Luther uses an innocuous remote control to open a walk in vault hidden behind a large wall mirror and loads his satchel with over a million dollars worth of goodies.  Before he can leave, though, unexpected visitors enter the bedroom, switch on the light and Luther discovers the mirror is a one-way window used by the aged husband to watch his young wife entertain lovers.  Trapped in the vault, Luther witnesses the lady of the house engage none other than the President of the United States in a tragic tryst that ends in her death.

The engaging plot continues through about three fourths of the novel when the accumulated coincidences begin to diminish the story, which then turns sour with several needless killings, and finally finishes with an unimaginative ending.

ABSOLUTE POWER would have been an absolute joy if it were a hundred pages shorter.  The movie version eliminates the heedless subplots, but wipes out some of the good stuff too.  I recommend both the novel and the movie; between the two, you can imagine the perfect compromise.
