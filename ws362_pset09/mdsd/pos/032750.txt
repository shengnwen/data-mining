This is a great book.  Fast and easy to read, it cuts through the diet frustration and confusion that's out there. After reading and trying so many popular diets, it's comforting to find advice that makes sense and applies to everyday life. I thank the authors for presenting recommendations that a person can really use. They offer common sense advice that applies to any person who has struggled with their weight. After reading this book, I realized the concept is something I've always known but needed to hear from outside myself before it really sunk in. The hunger rating system makes SO MUCH SENSE!  I highly recommend this book.
