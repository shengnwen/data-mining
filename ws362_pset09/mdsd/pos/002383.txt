This book was a very interesting insight into the mind of Eminem. With thorough details into his childhood traumas and experiences with racism and bullying, you can begin to empathise with Eminem and understand the controversy of his lyrics and why he so extreme with his music. I enjoyed reading this book and now appreciate Eminem and his principles
