In a world where the potential for nuclear disaster looms,  Cormac McCarthy's novel should strike a chord with everyone.  His detail of the dust, ash and destruction is overwhelming and vividly bleak.  The relationship between a father and his young son is pared down to the bare minimum as they struggle to survive in a post  apocalyptic landscape.  It is a brutal story of a life where just getting through each day is questionable and mistakes are unforgiving.  As the father and son head south looking for sometimes nothing more than mere endurance, they encounter  few other survivors, and those they do find are surviving at any cost.  The father tells his son that they must survive without becoming inhuman, they must maintain hope, that they possess a light of goodness that must not be tarnished.  The father and son find that this is not as clear a "mission"  as they would think and sometimes the line is nearly crossed.  The son questions the father relentlessly during these times saying, "..but we would never do that, right." The father reassures his son that they would not loose their "light" of humanity.
Cormac McCarthy has rendered a clear picture at life burned down to it's purest essence. He clearly illustrates and differentiates the nature of man bent on soulless survival and those who hunger for more humane ideals.
