Ant (Another Neat Tool) is a build tool that facilitates building applications using Java. To use Ant, you construct a build file that then directs the various Java software packages to automate the building of a working application. The book starts with a simple application: compiling Java source. From here it goes on to ever more complex projects until the whole Ant language is covered. 

The only complaint I have about the book is the beginning. You'd better have some idea about what you are trying to do before getting started. The book gives analogies like: "Thing of your source code as raw materials that you are sending into a factory for processing and assembly into a product, say an automobile. ... Ant is the factory floor with all the whiz-bang gizmos." What's this supposed to mean? Come on guys, we're talking about a software package, not a factory. It seems like the first part of the book is written to impress rather than express. 

If you know you need Ant, then I'd recommend the book, it's just the first chapter that's a mess.
