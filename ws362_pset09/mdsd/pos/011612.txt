This text was assigned as part of a college history course.  As part of my initial reading I found the text to be wordy, indirect and a little overly complicated.  However, after reviewing the test for an essay it became far more easily to take meaningful information from.  Cronon does an excellent job explaining the transition of Indian culture and society.  He also does a very good job of explaining the complex interaction between Indians and European settlers and the American wilderness.  In my opinion Cronon focuses on capitalism and the transitions towards capitialism and Indian society.  Overall a good history read, very applicable to American history
