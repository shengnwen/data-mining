Before reading this book, I had only heard of Robert's Rules of Order, but had never understood what they were or why they were so commonly used.  As I read this, lightbulbs kept turning on in my head as it explained many things I'd seen but did not realize they were so formally described.  It made me laugh at the farcical meetings I've been to in the past that were supposedly run according to Robert's Rules but were instead terribly managed.  I appreciated this book's approach to showing examples, by using the same scenario and looking at it from different perspectives relevant to the topic being discussed, rather than using multiple scenarios that might have hidden or confused the point.  The topic is somewhat dry, but this book succeeded in making me interested in using Robert's Rules in the future, and also in learning more details to ensure I apply them correctly.  The book isn't perfect, but it's good enough that I could see buying more copies to give to others
