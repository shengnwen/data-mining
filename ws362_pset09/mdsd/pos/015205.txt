Gemmell devivers again with this tale of high fantasy. Connavar is the name of the man who is the sword in the storm. A brave, yet sometimes rash warrior, who from a boy is destined for greatness. Unlike many stories along this theme, this one is focused on the learning proces of this future hero, rather than on the actual acts of greatness he will someday achieve. As we read, we watch Connavar grow up, with all the trials and tribulations that come with achieving manhood. Only towards the end of the book do we see the results of his training when the enemy is approaching... 
What makes Gemmell books so amazing is his ability to write secondary characters that we care about. For example, the witch, his father and mother, and even his rivals all have a role to play in the development and success of the tale. 
I did not find Connavar as intriguing as Druss the Legend, however, that is likely a function of how wonderful the Druss stories are, and should not be seen as a failing of the Rigante series. I would definatly recommend this book as a stand alone tale, or a prelude to the rest of the Rigante series. Gemmell is a King of fantasy, and any fan of might and magic would be a fool to not venture into this storm.
