Fast pace.  Good story.  It's a good mystery but the romance end is definitely in the background.  This book is essentially a mystery with a dash of romance.  The hardcover copy is beautifully decorated on the inside.  I loved the way the page numbers were set off the the side of the page with a little decoration on each side.  It's a truly beautiful book
