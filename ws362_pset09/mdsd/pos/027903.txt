A really honest book for a man to write and strikes a chord for every wife. From a female point of view it is good to know that men recognise their 'guy' habits. It is extremely funny and his observations are 'spot on'.

However,I think he is a bit scornful of the 'non guys', some of whom must seem very appealing to the females married to the guys
