Thanks to Anne Cassidy, I'm getting out of the brat race. My oldest was raised 'the old fashioned way' - my youngest had the benefit of a mother with experience , a mom who could afford to stay home and who read the latest studies, books, and every parenting magazine out there in an effort to find 'the right way' for baby dear. Guess what ? My youngest is a brat ! Ok, maybe not a BRAT, but he was well on his way. My life went from balanced, to kid-centered. My parenting techniques went from, 'you'll get over it' to 'we can't blame him for expressing his feelings, he needs to be heard'.  I still wanted to be the best parent I could be, but how was it that after spending all this time paying so much attention to my kids, I couldn't leave the house ? Thanks to Anne Cassidy, I've learned to have more faith in my gut - and more appreciation for the hard -learned lessons my Granma taught
