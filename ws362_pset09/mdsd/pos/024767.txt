TKaM is not the finest piece of prose -- though it does have some terrific (sometimes humorous, sometimes heartbreaking) stretches.  Nor is it the most compelling story.  But it is a story well told, well voiced (by its very young narrator), and well paced.  Above all, it is a story whose themes -- addressed to the best and the worst in human nature -- endure, themes that (one alternately hopes and is greatly saddened to think) will endure forever.  For this reason, in spite of its quaint anachronistic feel, TKaM is a novel for the ages, and a particularly important read for children.  I had the special pleasure of listening to TKaM narrated by Sissy Spacek, the perfect voice for Scout.
