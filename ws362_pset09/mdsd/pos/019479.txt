Not a bad deal for ten dollars.  The main flaw with the book is that there are very few pictures to help explain the tricks.  Though, with just a bit of imagination most of the tricks are easy to figure out.  Though, the great thing about this book is that for ten bucks you get 200 tricks.  The tricks are all picked that can be done with easily obtainable objects.  There a dozens of tricks that can be done with object found at any bar or dinner table.  Plus there are some great mental tricks, which are my favorite and require no objects or simply a piece of paper and a pen.
