This is the greatest book I ever read. I believe that this is the best book that Danille Steel has ever wrote. I couldn't put the book down. I got like 5 infractons for not putting it down. When my friends called me I  wasn't even listening to them. Once I got done I read it about 5 more  times. The movie they made for this book wasn't even as good as the book
