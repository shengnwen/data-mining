        Richard Siken's  "Crush," touches upon the themes of need and lust with a voice that is quick, witty, somber, sarcastic, and direct. Sarcasm comes out in poems such as "Litany in Which Certain Things.  Are Crossed Out,"  with lines like "Dear  So-and-So, I'm sorry I couldn't come to your party./Dear So-and-So, I'm so sorry I came to your party," along with his wit, with lines like, "Inside your head you hear a phone ringing/and when you open your eyes/only a clearing with a deer in it.  Hello, deer." 
	 He often begins a poem as a simple narrative, telling the reader exactly where he is.  In  "Straw House, Straw Dog"  he begins with, "I watched TV," and from there, complicates and enriches the theme of loss and need by making the narrative grow into  lines like "I swallowed crushed ice/pretending it was glass and you're dead." The building of narrative integrates the reader into the story at the pace Siken chooses.
	Siken often uses the second person to address issues, such as sexual relationships in "Boot Theory."  By using the second person, Siken is able to guide us in a story about ourselves, even when it is not something that we may have personally experienced.  He tells us what we did, what we want.  It's a powerful tool to bring the reader into the poem and keep one's attention.  His particular ability in manipulating the "you" in his poetry is that he make subjects such as same-sex love and lust part of our immediate knowledge base.  His use of repetition, such as in "Scheherazade," allows Siken to snag the big, almost unwieldy emotions before they float away.   In "Scheherazade," the phrase "tell me" is used to grab the unraveling of thoughts before they get out of hand. 
	Siken is a unique pleasure to read.  He allows the reader to be a participate in experiences that might otherwise be unavailable to them.
