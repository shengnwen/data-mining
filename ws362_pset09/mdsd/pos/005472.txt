I study organic chemistry in trondheim Norway, and we use this book in one of our classes. I think it's a good book, but it's too detailed some times. We have almost the whole book to learn for the exam befor summer, and too many details makes it harder to read, but you learn how to take whats the most important.
Overall this is a good book to learn organic synthesis
