Rabinger as a writer has a superbly no-nonsense approach to his subject matter, and the book covers every aspect of the life of the documentary film. He explores the key elements of creating the the work (or body of work) and fits a series of practical steps and tips for each element.

These elements include: Historical Background, Preproduction, Production, Post-Production,  Technical Basics, Projects for Developing Skills, and Career Track. 

The appendices and the annotated bibliography are very useful, and the book is worth the price just for these additions.

Directing the Documentary is an essential for a student of film
