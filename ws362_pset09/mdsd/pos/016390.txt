If you enjoyed the author's 'Having a Mary Heart, in a Martha World' you will also enjoy this one.  This book covers some hard questions of character, in order to help you become more like Jesus Christ, in His strength.  I highly recommend this book, although it does overlap slightly with the afore mentioned book.  Another great, spirit-filled study written by Joanna Weaver
