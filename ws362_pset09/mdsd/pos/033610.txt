I spend a great deal of time in my car so finding a good book that is 8 cassettes is usually a bonus.  Doc Holidays' story is good; however, she should have never read her book.  She frequently stumbles over simple words and is pretty much monotone during the entire tape.  As you listen to each tape her reading becomes worse and worse.  I truly believe a 5th grader could have read her story with more clarity and enthusiasm.  Sorry Doc, good story annoying acoustics
