Daft and Lengel are established teacher/scholars in the organizational sciences, and that's part of what makes this book so effective. While the ideas may seem to be &quot;New Age,&quot; they stem from writers I would not associate with much of the fluff writing on the market. This book is an excellent and credible model of a new and more powerful vision for what leadership is. By beginning with a model for how to make personal change, the authors offer a model that empowers the reader for personal action rather than circumstances beyond her or his immediate control
