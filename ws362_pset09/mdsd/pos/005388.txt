I may be in the minority here, but I enjoy Ms Brockmann's SEAL Team 16 series for the plots and dialogue over the romance.  I've been known to skip over the romance scenes and descriptions of Hyper-Emotional-Warriors-in-Love just to find out what will happen next. If she ever wants to venture outside of the romance realm she's known for, I think Brockmann could do quite well with a straight thriller. 

I wondered what would happen when all of the SEAL team's stories were told. This new Troubleshooter series seems set up to solve the biggest problem of the series: how many guys can possibly be on this team?  At some point, all of their stories have to be told. By creating a spin off, Ms Brockmann allows for two parallel series as she introduces new characters into both the Troubleshooters and SEAL team 16. If she continues to keep up both series, they should nicely compliment each other.

Up to this point, most of the women in Ms Brockmann's books have served only one purpose.  They are romantic interests that really don't fit into the working world of the men. The novels end with marriage proposals that seem to shuffle the women off into the background.  Hopefully, characters like Tess and Alyssa will continue to be active members of the cast.  And, please Ms Brockmann, I know rescues from peril are romantic, but if you're going to create strong, independent women, they shouldn't need men to rescue them constantly.

Flashpoint vies with Over the Edge in terms of plot.  The larger international situations Brockmann dreams up are much more intriguing than the smaller, local problems she creates for her characters.  Although my favorite Brockmann character is still Max, I am intrigued by the men introduced in Flashpoint. I can't wait to see where their further adventures lead
