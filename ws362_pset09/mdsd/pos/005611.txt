With a futile effort at journalistic objectivity, Packer lays out step by step the incompetence and lack of planning that led to the botched war in Iraq.  He shows both the political and the human face of the war and weaves them together into a coherent whole.

Meet the Iraqi people, the victims of this debacle. Unprepared for democracy after years of a brutal totalitarian regime, they looked to their liberators for guidance and found a disorganized ground force that lacked a comprehensive plan for reconstruction.  Packer makes it obvious that the architects of this war failed miserably to understand and plan for the most basic of physical and psychological human needs.

This isn't just a disquistion on the mechanics of a war, it is a glimpse into a culture whose mores, not to mention social structures, are so different from our own, that we cannot understand their needs. What leaps off every page is that Americans keep making the same mistakes over and over, assuming that other peoples (Vietnamese, Iraqis) are simply us with a different name. This is a tribal culture, fragmented for centuries, with demographics that make it clear that a unified and democratic Iraq will take far longer to create than its liberators ever anticipated.

Reading this book, it is difficult to reconcile the genuinely good intentions of so many involved in the occupation, with the Machiavellian manipulations of the administration that talked America into it.
Assassin's Gate makes it clear that the state of affairs in Iraq is too complex to be reduced to simplistic concepts like winning or losing.  Whatever happens, Iraq will never be the same, and whether this is for good or ill, only history will tell.
