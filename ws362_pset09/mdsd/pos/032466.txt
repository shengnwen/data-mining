An excellent book for teenagers, and also for adults who want to discover the social climate of Jesus time. The discriptions around the Lake of Galilee lets one feel as if there are there. It's a fast read and one that you don't want to put down. We distributed approximately 30 of these books during the Lenten Season, excellent reports returned
