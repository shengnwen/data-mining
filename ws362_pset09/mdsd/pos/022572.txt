"Most people operate in a stimulus/response mode.  Something happens; they respond.  Something else happens; they respond.  This chapter will show you how to control your world instead of continually reacting to various stimuli.  Outcome-Based Thinking will allow you to decide what you want and how to get it."

The book is based on the principles of knowing what you want and consistently doing what it takes to realize your desires.  Even if you forget to apply any of the rules and methods of persuasion, the skill of Outcome-Based Thinking makes this book well worth owning
