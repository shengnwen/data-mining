When you read this book, you'll discover:

1)  How mutual fund managers work and that what's best for their interest is usually counter to yours
2)  What Rule #1 is (and Rule #2)
3)  Stringent and specific guidelines of companies to invest in.
4)  Some rules of thumb about your portfolio (but not too many)
5)  Why the stock market is the best money maker for an investor who knows what he or she is doing (this book teaches you)
6)  Popular and current free research tools online that help you find particular company data, as well as screen stocks based on those criteria
7) Who really runs the stock market (85% institutional ownership)
8)  How to track where institutional capital is flowing, and simply follow (Town uses the analogy of you being on a wave runner and them being on a huge cruise ship)
9)  What it means to actually LOSE money (breaking Rule #1)
10)  How to calculate the "Big 5" numbers.

Do you know what the moving average, MACD, and stochastic charts are?  If so, do you know how to read them?  And if you know how to read them, do you know the best settings to have them on?  If not, read this book.

I wish I read the book earlier, and I'm only 22.  Look at the reviews, it's a good book, the reviews really do it justice.  If you want, go to www.philtown.typepad.com and checkout his blog (updated weekly)
