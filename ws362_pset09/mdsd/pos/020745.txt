I, too, found this to be a fascinating read. I think that anyone with an interest in world politics would also find it fascinating; it takes a long, effective look at a nation that has gone from communism to democracy to something in between. According to the book, Russia is a work in progress - the Soviet Union without the really bad parts - and Vladimir Putin is a leader not afraid of shoving his nation along.

Putin comes off as a gifted leader with no qualms about tampering with the concept of democracy as long it brings stability to Russia. I daresay that most readers won't  approve of many or all of Putin's tactics, but at least they will come out of the book with a sense of where this all comes from - and where it might lead. To me, that makes this a worthwhile read
