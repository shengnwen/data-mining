I have known this book for over 20 years.  I has been almost a bible for my foraging.  I used to borrow it from the library several times a year.  Then the county libraby removed it from the shelf to make room for newer books.  I was very dissappointed.  I had to borrow the book from a library 2 counties away.  I was delighted to discover that Amazon carried Stalking the Wild Asparagus.  The book is a wonderful reference tool, personable, acurate, and has detailed illustrations
