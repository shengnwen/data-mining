How utterly fasinating.  A strange futuristic world where humans have become the inferior race.  The fairy creatures have come out of the closet and are controlling all aspects of the world.  Poison lives in the deadly swamp with her father, stepmother and baby sister.  She chose her own name to spite her stepmother, yet she doesn't have an evil stepmother, just someone she doesn't get along with.  

When the fairies switch her babysister for a changling, Poison takes on the dangerous journey to fairyland to get her back.  A crazy, creepy, scary, intriquing, and heartwarming journey with a surprise ending.  

This is definitely worth your time.  It's the first book by this author I have read and I loved it. I simply could not put it down until I finished it
