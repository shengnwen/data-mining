This book is an entertaining page turner, as we follow the author in his exploits and experiences in investment banking.  However, as someone who knows a bit about the derivatives business, it is clear that the author tries to sensationalize the transactions, using the expression &quot;ripping someone's face off&quot; too often.  Clients of investment banks are, for the most part, very experienced financial managers, who generally choose complex financial structures because these are the structures that exactly fit their needs.  It is very rare (I have never seen it) that a customer would buy something he was not thoroughly familiar with.  My only conclusion can be that the author was eager to write a book, and so chose every single transaction he was exposed to and created the image that customers were always innocent bystanders
