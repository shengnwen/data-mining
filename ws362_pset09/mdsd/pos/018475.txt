1.	I recommend this book to people that love geography because they can find all ways that Laura did with her family. She traveled many times and the place is the old west in United States. It is amazing!!!!
2.	If you want find a woman with brave and encourage in the life you have to read Laura Ingalls. She shows us that the life is hard, but also that we have to fight and reach our goals.
3.	This book is easy to read, so you can finish it in a couple of hours. I am sure you will have a very good time. Good luck!!!!
