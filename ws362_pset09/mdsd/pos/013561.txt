I found this to be an excellent addition to the curriculum when I was teaching English abroad.  If nothing else, it's a great book to bring into the classroom around Halloween, especially if you add some activities to the lessons.  I don't imagine it would be very much fun to just hang out and read this book for pleasure, but it really helped me keep my students' attention in class.
