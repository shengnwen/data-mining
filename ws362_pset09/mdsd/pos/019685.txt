My kids and I tried this cookbook from the library.  While we really enjoyed making a few of the recipes out of this book (esp. the popovers) I have to agree with another reviewer that the format makes it someone difficult to use-esp. on the spur of the moment.  The adult really needs to have time to have thoroughly read the recipe and gathered all the ingredients before the kids join you in the kitchen.  Then you can flip to the illustrated instructions for the kids.  This is a good idea but not always practical.  It would of been nice to have the two meshed so that the kids could "read" the illustrations, while you read the directions.  I also found the recipes limited in scope and difficulty, but it is great for cooking with preschool age children
