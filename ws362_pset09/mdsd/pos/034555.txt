although i have only read this novel once so far,i found it to be extremely compelling. questions of: deceit,betrayal,revenge,desire and power tirade throughout the play. for who is really honest?- certainly not  gerardo(a recarnation of robespierre); nor paulina (your frustated,  dillusional, prototypical housewife);nor ricardo (the sly,oil slicked  stranger accused). these characters undeniable flaws (it could be argued  that dorfman has potrayed every piitful and pathetic trait ever known to  man)seem to cause their downfalls,but also growth within themselves and  their relations with others.  surely the final setting will  influence the  reader to think so
