It certainly doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that whatever "inputs" we put into a system (Earth, humans, water, air, etc.), will in turn impact the system and the systems "outputs."  If we put poison into the soil, air, and water, we will ultimately re-ingest these materials and create a toxic environment that will be unable to support the system that we are purportedly trying to save.  Do the logic yourself.  What kind of logic is it that would say that malaria deaths justify the use of DDT?  We have no idea of how many millions, or billions, of people globally have been impacted by its use in the forms of debilitating illnesses and death from cancer and the like.  With this false rationale, just as in the current debate over the use and subsequent output of carbon materials, we are again showing our naivete in believing that we can put a "technological" fix on an issue that is better addressed by the way we live and consume.  So, we save all these poor souls from malaria, but then we give them a planet that is poisonous?  Nonsensical at best
