This book is a must-have for teachers and librarians, but most importantly, for parents who want a culturally literate child.  As a teacher (grades 4th - 12th), I recommend the Core Knowledge Series by the same author as the framework for home schooling.  Please don't wait, parents!  Get this book and start collecting these resources!  You can't rely on any school to teach your child all they should know.  If you are reading this, you are a conscientious parent.  Your child's school may well be focused on teaching basic life skills such as manners and self esteem, because not all parents are conscientious.  After all, parents are ultimately responsible for their child's education.  Even if you aren't home schooling, get this to help you supplement your child's education.  Get the "What your K/1st/2nd...6th grader Needs to Know" books, too.  You will be amazed at how much these books enrich your child's education, and ultimately their life
