This book is good not only as a text book because of the simple way it presents the subject, the problems, and the complementary examples on the CD. It is also a great reference, because it has every chapter sumarized by the end, with the formulas. It includes multiple examples both on the book and the Cd, and allows full use of computational tools applied on the problem solving
