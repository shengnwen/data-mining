The best take I've read on Lafferty is from John Clute's Encyclopaedia of Fantasy. He echoes the view that R.A. Lafferty is his own man, and you've got to read all of him to even start to know what he's about. Someone new to Lafferty would be better off starting with Fourth Mansions or Past Master or Reefs of Earth or the many volumes of short stories. Those books make some concessions to the general reader, while this one decidedly does not.

Thanks to Wildside Press for making this novel available. I had looked for a long time for a "new" Lafferty novel and could only find more short stories. Nothing against those; I read his stories avidly before ever cracking the cover of a novel, but I enjoy it when Lafferty stretches out in a full-length work and invites us into his universe.

Serpent's Egg takes place in the indeterminate future of 2035 when all sorts of experiments are taking place between animals, humans and humanoid computers, resulting in various hybrid offspring. These mega-persons all reach maturity at ten years old, but should they prove to be a serpent's egg, a threat to the "floating world", assassins are sent after them by the Kangaroo Court, seen as a portent in the sky of a kangaroo. The offspring of four experiments join up to form a magic twelve, including in their number a psychic python, an unborn elephant, a wolverine, a bear, a computer, and a few humans. It's all very Laffertarian and it probably doesn't give anything away to say that the epilog (written by a whale) claims that half the book is lies.

I had a copy of Wildside Press' collection of Lafferty stories, Iron Tears, which had a lot of typos in it. It may have since been edited, however, since my edition doesn't have the introduction by Michael Swanwick included in the newer edition. Regardless, this book has few typos and is well-produced. It's also as much reading as a whole book of short stories, just right for Laffertarian bedtime reading.
