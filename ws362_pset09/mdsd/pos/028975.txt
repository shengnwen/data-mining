 I'm a true crime reader and see this book titled "Witch" on the shelves-- and I am a Pagan. Yup I bought this book. Back in my mind I was thinking " oh no not another "occult crime" " Wicca" murder" book but my resevations were gladly set aside when the author makes it clear from the get-go that what this woman was in was NOT Wicca and that murder is against our religion.

Kudos also go to the author for writing an obviously well-researched book. It's pretty clear that the woman and her parents were dysfunctional and probably mentally ill. It's just not smart to rent a storage room and keep your dead mother in it for over a year while her corpse, to put it bluntly, liquifies into gravy.

The only problem I can see with this book is the alleged " skull" jewelry or emblem found in a home where her father ( a supposed satanist) once resided in. The photo of this object is not detailed enough and frankly it looks more like a spread bird's tail depiction than an actual skull representation. I am hardly an expert of Satanism, so I don't recognize this object. It strikes me as a "spooky out of ignorance" type of " proof"
