As a teacher, I have found this particular volume of Lynn Johnson's to touch a particular chord with me. But then again, I have been using her cartoon strips to teach with, for years. Her gentle yet penetrating way of looking at life with children, from babyhood through the teen years with its peer pressure, to adulthood, make me laugh out loud and cry as well. Long may she put out her strip, well into great grandmotherhood
