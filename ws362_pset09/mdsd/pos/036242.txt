I found this book hard to read. The print is small and there is alot of it where I think it could have maybe been condensed. Also the relationship between the writing and the pictures was not clear. I like a book that refers to the organ or part of the organ and then tells you to color it. I learn better this way. However, this is the only physiology coloring book that I could find so I was definitely able to make use of it
