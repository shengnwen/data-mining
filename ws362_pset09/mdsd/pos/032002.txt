I like this book as it offers you advice on what to look for.
If used wisely this book will help you from being ripped off by deceitful people.I mean the real crooks.This book shows you techniques to help you get to the truth of matters.Each chapter has a summary for quick reference.

I would suggest that anyone buying this book you dont use it against people in your life that you know are genuine and honest.There's an example in the book about friends wanting to see a movie.If your friend doesnt like a movie you want to see you,get over it.We all tell little white lies.Dont put your friends under interrogation for it.Save it for the real crooks
