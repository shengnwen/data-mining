Film photographers have long savored black-and-white photography for its stark alternative to realism, and the stripped down, minimalistic approach to creating an image.  Digital photography threatened to push black-and-white photography to extinction, but, thankfully, artists like Hamilton have preserved the spirit of the medium and extended it through the use of Adobe's flagship image editor.

The author shows you the proper way to create monochrome images while preserving -- or enhancing tonality.  He explains that a good black-and-white image isn't simply a color image that's been desaturated.  I also liked the exploration into reproducing traditional darkroom techniques in Photoshop.  This is a must-have book for any serious black-and-white worker
