This book is very large and covers the war in Russia. It delves into not only the battles, but the diplomacy, politics, economics, propaganda, civilian reaction etc....The author was born in Russia and returns to Russia as a correspondent for the Sunday Times and as a commentator for the BBC. Fluent in Russian, he is able during this time to interview many, different types of Russian people, from statesman to peasant. This book is a record of what went on in the country during those years. Published in 1964 after Stalin had died, this is a very impressive early work on the subject matter. 
It deals with almost every aspect of Russian European diplomacy leading up to and post WW2. The attitude and writing in Pravda are also detailed and show how the people thought and reacted to the official news of the times. The Ukraine, Poland and Finnish questions are mentioned and insight into the Russian reason for their treatment. 
War crimes are also in the book, the author traveled to the Maidanek death camp outside of Lublin, Poland. The horror and the reaction to this from his superiors was one of disbelief. He also went into Stalingrad after the battle and describes it in detail and gives the impression of total destruction and huge loss of life on both sides. 
The one thing that I find interesting about this book, is that the author was there amid the times and chronicles every aspect of what went on in the daily working of both the government and the people as well as keeping an eye on the propaganda and the reactions to the "other Allies" 
Whew! Only listed at 18.49 USD, but well Werth it.
