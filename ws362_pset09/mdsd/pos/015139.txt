As someone who suffers a considerable amount of pain, thanfully not from leprosy, I have to admit, until I read this book I never considered that pain was a gift.

As he worked, Paul Brand discovered that God had granted us pain as a gift, and consequently, not all solutions lay in medical textbooks. The Gift of Pain  would make a wonderful gift for anyone who cares about people. A difficult book to put down
