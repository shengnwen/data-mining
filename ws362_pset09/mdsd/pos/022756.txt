Like all of Joan's books, this one is easy to read and follow, and has great doll clothing ideas.  Her patterns are easy to understand and always go together well, and fit American Girl style dolls to a T.  I enjoyed this book because there are so many ethnic designs; it will be fun to find just the right fabrics to make them all.  I highly recommend this book
