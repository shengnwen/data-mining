In the postwar US, Freudianism was an art of those concerned with the temporary suspension of unpleasant &quot;realities&quot;: artists and intellectuals, persons intent on the maintenance of certain standards in the face of certain social leitmotifs.  But &quot;ego psychology&quot; and the Lacanianism which challenged it in the name of  scientific ethics were not the only Freud booms to occur, and the most poorly-remembered influence of Freud is perhaps that of James Strachey's Standard Translation on 20th-century Britain.  Strachey's choices for translation of Freud's German are almost  downright misleading from the standpoint of Freud's own concerns as a steward of Austro-Hungarian culture, but it is to be remembered that Freud's early work was read intensively by European intellectuals; and the group of British intellectuals centered around the Independent Labour Party was no exception, as the tendency of Freud's thought corresponded nicely to the ILP's already-existing concern with the &quot;delinking&quot; of moralism from the politics of everyday life.  In other words, it would perhaps be a good idea to consider Strachey's Freud not as anticipating further developments in the line of positivistic decomposition of social mores but as a response to Shavian refusals of certain arrangements (such as enfranchised Britons were offered in lieu of the rapidly expanding social services of their Continental contemporaries): perhaps Bloomsbury can be taken to have codified the rules of this form of *epater*, rather than reinvented it with any &quot;singlemindedness&quot;, and perhaps this work deserves to be taken as exemplary of this succor rather than scientifically &quot;exceptionable&quot; in its conjecture -- no matter how much we scruple to rigorize, no &quot;research program&quot; can be attributed to those whose assays produce no viable counterexamples
