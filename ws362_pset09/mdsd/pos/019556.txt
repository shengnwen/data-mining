If you are wanting to lose weight and have tried everything on the market you may have missed out on a big secret:  Running Burns Fat Fast!  I got this book and followed the 10K training guidelines and have lost weight rapidly and feel better than I have in years.

This book will encourage you to make it to the finish line; whether that finish line is the New York City Marathon or your neighborhood post office, this book will help you get there
