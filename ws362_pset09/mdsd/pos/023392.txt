First off, this book presents several examples of best practices ("case studies"), including United Colors of Beneton, Motley Fool, and Ford. 

Second of all, Locke doesn't hold any marketer's hand, and yes, he can be pretty brutal at times. He assumes, quite rightly, that you didn't get into this job to help humanity, you got into to get a paycheck. That's not cynicism, that's intellectual honesty, and if you can't handle it, you'll never be anything but mediocre. 

Essentially, Locke's main thesis is: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEDIOCRE MARKETING AND GREAT MARKETING IS INTELLECTUAL HONESTY. And if it takes him 200 pages to make this point, then the fault lies in how much we have grown accustomed to believing our own B.S., just because its easier that way. How my corporations have lied themselves into bankruptcy? How many bad projects have you seen go forward because everyone was too scared to get in the way?

This book is a bricolage of good points and great ideas. As a consistant system, it fails.In the real world, Locke's ideas are completely unworkable, IF YOU FOLLOW THEM VERBATIM. Like any idealistic manifesto, it's got its fair share of hyperbole. 

However, in terms of a Marketing Philosophy, it's brilliant. Whenever I get discouraged, I read this book. It reminds me of a comment David Ogilvy once made, "The consumer isn't a moron, she's your wife", meaning that advertisers and marketers should treat their audiences with respect and dignity (or else)
