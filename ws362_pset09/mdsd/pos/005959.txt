Red haired with a flaming temper, the phenomenal Anne Shirley is back in her 2nd book! Marilla, a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing Anne up (when she was an orphan) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins, Davy and Dora Keith. Anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble. Davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes: like making his sister Dora walk the pig fence! Davy??s idea of fun includes violence and humor ?V but only for himself. The girls have to teach Davy manners, which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy. Anne??s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again, but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world. At school, she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students, especially Paul Irving, this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen. He brings her flowers and calls her ??Sweet Teacher??. Her friendship with striking Gilbert Blythe (ex-enemy for calling her hair ??carrots??) has grown, but what is Gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant? Has Diana (her bosom friend) finally grown up? I really enjoyed this book because it talks about Anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever. I simply couldn??t put it down because after every page, Anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger. My mom keeps telling me to go and do work but I cannot stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written. I like the others in this series also.Thank you L.M. Montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life!~~ Referring to the special collectors editio
