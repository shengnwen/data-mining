This book is true to its ancient origins, yet accessible to the sincere Western aspirant. Swami Radha's 'Kundalini for the West,' provides yogic exercises to access the ancient evolutionary cakra system of Kundalini. Kundalini yoga in western culture has grown to mean many things. In 'Kundalini for the West,' Swami Radha provides layers of access to work with each cakra. Each cakra is given its own series of practices: mantra, breath practices, and questions of self-reflection/life reflection, which are used to glean insight into one's inner life. There is no limit to the experiential possibilities offered through the practices detailed in this book
