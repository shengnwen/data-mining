This book is by the man who revolutionized bread baking and it is excellent.  The technical information on flours, oxidation, etc is very good.  All recipes are based on the bakers percentage formula so it is very easy to scale anything.  It is more for professionals but I have had no trouble adapating it to home use. This book will teach you to be a bread baker, not a follower of recipes. I highly recommend this for anyone who is serious about bread baking.  If you are a casual baker of loaves it may be too much.  If you can read basic French I encourge you to get the french edition as it costs about 25E's instead of the crazy price for the English translation
