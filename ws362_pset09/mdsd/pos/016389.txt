I must admit, this book did not really "add" that much more theological knowledge to my repertoire than what I have already learned from other apologetics books. However, this was not a mere apologetics book. This book was a book written by the author to his evangelical friends and family, a religious and spiritual community which he used to belong to. David B. Currie is a convert to Catholicism. Much like many other converts from evangelical Protestantism you will find that the question of authority comes back to haunt them as they continue practicing their traditions. As is common, they continue to study Church History and the Early Church Fathers, then they discover that the Early Church has more in common with today's Catholic Church than today's Evangelical churches. This is not to mention how much appeal to tradition evangelicals actually accept, though they would not admit it as "tradition".

David Currie presents case after case and dilemma after dilemma he faced as he examined the traditions of his church trying to find the roots of them. Are they really adherents to the so called "sola scriptura" doctrine or do they inadvertently subscribe to extra-Biblical materials? The answer will shock you.

Born Fundamentalist, Born Again Catholic is a great book concerning the systematic steps a former fundamentalist took which led him through the doors of the historical Church, the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. His chapters lead us through the core doctrines which separate Catholics and Protestants the most:

*	Communion and the Real Presence
*	Scriptural Authority
*	Authority
*	The Bible
*	Salvation
*	The Incarnation
*	Mary
*	Premillennialism  and Eschatology
*	Moral Issues

To think, at one time, I was on the same path, except the opposite direction. As close as my face is to this computer screen in front of me, I was that close to leaving the Catholic Church and on my way into fundamentalist churches. God didn't speak to me through tragedy or emotional rollercoaster's as is true for many converts, for He knew those things would not convince me. I think He spoke to me the only way I would listen, through the books and articles I came across. Having experienced this "intellectual conversion" and books like this one, which enlightens us to the appeals we must make to the other half of spectrum of people seeking the reason why they should convert, not just because of an emotional journey necessarily, but a certainty that within the hallowed halls of the Catholic Church, we find the doctrines and dogmas which convey the fullness of God's divine revelation.
