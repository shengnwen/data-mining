A successful novel or at least a decent story is the result of some interesting characters (ie., quirky/sexy detective, her secretive/secret agent/special forces/moody/dark boyfriend...who comes in and out of the story to save the day and have great sex...a genius sidekick who is in lust with the sexy detective, but who is sleeping with the thick librarian...and a host of other characters)...a decent although predictable plot (I was not surprised who the murderer was...if you are a person who reads these type of suspense stories you will be able to guess)and a nice tone. I would recommend that you read this novel. I think there were more good points than bad
