Ox could blow the roof off the house almost any night with his thundering bass guitar anchoring The Who.  No job in rock 'n' roll ever demanded more sense of rhythm that Mr. Entwistle's.  The freewheeling guitar style of Peter Townshend, the ultra-dynamic approach of Keith Moon (and those who followed on the skins), and Roger Daltry's fluid vocals certainly needed a Gilbrater of Rock to anchor their sound.

Preventing a runaway train wreck was Ox.

His life with the bass guitar resulted in one of the world's top collections, lovingly presented in magnificent color and display here.  The concise commentary about each guitar is just enough to categorize it, place it in historical context of The Who or musical style, and reveal an intimacy about the artist himself.

I love this book.
