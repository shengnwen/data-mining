I have read many books on starting your own business by successful CEO's. Most end up to be ego filled babblings, but this is one of the most amazing, useful books I have ever come across. It is insightful, honest, and filled with plain common sense. I refer to it now as my Business Bible. You cannot go wrong following brilliant advice from someone who has proven herself time and time again
