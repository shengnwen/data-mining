Like another reviewer, I usually do not find Stanley Bing's writing interesting.  I find his writing more of inside jokes and tending toward rambling proses.

Having said that, I really enjoyed his latest endeavor, this time about the Roman Empire.  Instead of the usual historical perspective, he draws analogy from the empire's rise and fall to today's businesses, casting new light on the history.  A funny and insightful book
