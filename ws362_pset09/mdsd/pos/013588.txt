Eragons journey continues in this 2nd book from Christopher Paolini. Although a great deal of time is spent in the politics of the different races the storyline progresses fairly well. I have been reading this series to my boys and with the exception of having to explain quite a bit of the vocabulary, they have been enraptured by the story. We can't wait for book number three
