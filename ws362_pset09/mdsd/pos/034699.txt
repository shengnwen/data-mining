I've always wondered what I would do without Rosamunde Pilcher to soothe my reading mind....now it seems that Marcia Willet is a good...I don't want to say substitute, because no-one can replace RP, but she comes VERY close!

This is a good read - I enjoyed it.  The flow is great, the characters are well done and it is enough to encourage me to read another of MW's books.  If I had to use one word I would use
SOOTHING.   Well done Marcia!  thanks
