    Prasenjit Duara weaves together theoretical and historical material on China and India in this insightful look at how history has become "nation-centric."  Although historical writing has a long, diverse history beyond the nation-state, "modern history" in the Western sense began with the rise of the European nation-states in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.  

     Duara presents a series of brilliant, yet challenging arguments regarding the prevalence of the Nation in historiography.  His main argument is that "national history secures for the contested and contingent nation the false unity of a self-same, national subject evolving over time (page 2)."  This basically means that history, in the nation-centric sense, homogenizes difference, while separating itself from the "Other."  After expanding on this argument, Duara lays out several counter-narratives, primarily focused on periods in Chinese "nation-building" history, that attempt to "bifurcate" (i.e. complicate)the simplistic "Enlightenment history" that has become the staple of Chinese historiography.  His essays on civil society and provincial narratives (Chapters 5 and 6) are especially interesting. 

     I enjoyed reading Duara, and found his arguments very useful towards writing history that's not so nation-oriented (e.g. world-history, comparative studies).  His writing was clear, but still difficult because of the many postmodernist terms (be sure to read Foucault or at least have a postmodernist dictionary at hand).  I'd recommend reading Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities" first, if only because Anderson serves as a useful introduction to the debates over the nation-state concept/discourse.
