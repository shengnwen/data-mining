The novel moves rather slowly in the beginning, but when the character R.P. McMurphy arrives, it begins to move more quickly. Kesey succeeds in describing the scene and the emotions of the characters and the events that take place in the novel. The descriptions are so vivid that it makes the reader feel as if they are there with the other patients looking on. The reader is also able to feel what the characters feel through the descriptions. The Big Nurse's emotions and expressions are especially emphasized. Her coldness, fakeness, and domination over the patients are conveyed throughout the novel and are really brought out when she is provoked by McMurphy. 
The novel is narrated by one of the patients in the asylum, Chief Bromden.  Because he is a patient in the mental institution, it is vital for the reader to realize that and not believe everything he says. Bromden is in the institution for a reason and so reality and his imagination are mixed together to form his reality. 
The main theme of the novel is the struggle for power between authority and normal people, between woman and men.
