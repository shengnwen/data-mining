I can see getting a lot of value out of this book in years to come. It has clear description of the basic Lucky Thirteen exercises and then instructions on making variants of each of those exercises. 

Thanks to this book I now know how to do a crunch properly. Most books I have seen have left out some important details like not seeing your knees.

I immediately put the book in use, starting with the beginner program. Now, couple of weeks later I ran into the only thing I do not like about the book: Intermediate program is not something one can move smoothly to from the beginner program. It would mean going from 1 set of squats and lunges each to 9 sets! Ugh. However, I'm sure I can overcome that by adding sets on my own
