I've played D&D in its various forms for almost 20 years now.  This book finally answered all my questions about how to run ship-to-ship combat, sailing in bad weather and over and undersea travel!  I highly recommend it for any DM who has used the oceans in their campaign and then found they didn't know what to do once the PCs got out there.

For players there are multiple classes, new spells and new magic items to assist any seagoing person.  There are even magical ship modifications!

If all of that weren't enough, it includes new monsters and a whole slew of COMPLETE adventures to get you started. I HIGHLY recommend this book
