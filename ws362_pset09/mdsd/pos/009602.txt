I tutor in an adult literacy program. My student, who is in his 30s and not a native English speaker, really enjoyed this book, and is plowing through the second book now.

Although the writing style is a little old fashioned, the plots and characters are interesting for adult new readers. If you're looking for reading material for an adult literacy student, the Hardy Boys may be a good choice
