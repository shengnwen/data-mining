As an elementary teacher and a parent, I've developed a collection of party planning books for kid's parties.  This is the book I return to again and again for the best suggestions.  There are so many creative ideas for decorations, menus, games and party favors.  Some of my favorites include the Rainbow party (a big hit for toddlers!), the Firefighter party (including fun games involving squirting targets with a garden hose), and the Space party (where the favor bags are black bags poked with constellation holes and a flashlight!)
