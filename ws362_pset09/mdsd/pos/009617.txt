Having been a high school newspaper adviser (notice, &quot;adviser&quot; and not &quot;advisor&quot;?) for 8 years, I am like the other reviewer who wishes this book would have been available much earlier. As it is, my first year of teaching in 1993 included four preps: English 10 Honors, English 9, newspaper, and yearbook. (Anybody want to say &quot;Year of Insanity&quot;?) While I did survive, I struggled that year because the resources for publication advisers are very few. Starting almost from scratch and given very little in support, I ended up putting together my own bound journalism resource book, which is similar in many ways to Osborn's work. But the &quot;Survival Guide&quot; I bought last year is still worthwhile for me to have on hand because it has a number of &quot;cool&quot; sheets that can be photocopied. (Kudos for the wire spine that make turning pages and laying them on the photocopier simple!) Only those who have advised high school publications can fully appreciate the words of wisdom Osborn has because she has obviously been there, done that. Every principal should order a copy for the school's journalism teacher. I certainly plan on utilizing mine in the years to come
