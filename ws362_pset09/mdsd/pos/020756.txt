I purchased this book as a reference in using my new Digital 8 camcorder.  I was looking for something that would be an introduction to the theory of digital filmmaking and technical reference to make my home videos look good and maybe get me started in small MPEGs for use on the internet. The book has an engaging, easy to read style.  It is a general overview of video/film production and editing.  It makes clear that running the camera is a very small part of a very large and complex process.  If you have a dream of writing and producing a screenplay, this book will lay out the reality of the situation.  Additionally, the book offers other references that provide more in depth information on specific subjects.  The website is a nice idea, but like most of the book/cd/website combinations, large parts are still under construction since 3-28-2001.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for information on how to make better quality home videos and/or anyone dreaming of writing a screenplay
