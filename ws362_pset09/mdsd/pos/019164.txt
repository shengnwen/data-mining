This was the first "anti" vaccine book that I had read.  Well, it gives both sides of the story, but you know very well that it is mostly against vaccinations.  Very well documented with helpful herbal remedies for those who choose that route.
No, I do not have a master's degree like some who wrote for this review, but like THAT REALLY MATTERS!!!!  I am a mother, and I have vaccinated in the past and it had detrimental effects on my son.  We no longer vaccinate and we highly reccomend this book and that stance.  Educate yourselves America.  Open your eyes to the truth!  I also reccomend DPT:  A Shot in the Dark
