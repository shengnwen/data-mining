	I liked this book a lot the first time I read it, but not so much the second time. When I read it the first time, I didn't know what was going to happen so it was a surprise. However, when I read it the second time I knew what was going to happen, so it was kind of boring. I did like it a lot though because it was a really sad book and I love sad books.
	Sammy and Julie were the best of friends. They loved to go to parties together, they loved to dance together, and they loved to all around spend time together. They are in the middle of a dance class when Julie all of a sudden feels really sharp pains in her hip and back. Her mother has to take her to the hospital but they are no help at all. Julie goes through 13 different doctors before she even knows whats wrong with her. She then finds out she has a really bad cancer and it is spreading very fast. Julie has to drop out of school and dance class just to recover. Sammy is really upset that she can't see or talk to Julie! Julie gets worse and worse over time until one day she goes into a coma. Shortly after Sammy gets a call from Julie's mom and  rushes over to say good-bye. Shortly after Julie slips away!
	I recommend this book to teenagers that love sad books like me. This book is really sad!
