This is a follow up of the "Vagina Monologues," after Eve Ensler met women everywhere who felt and still feel grateful for Ms. Ensler's work to give women and girls an unstoppable voice that congruently communicates:

1.  Go the distance, and then some;
2.  Disarm the potentially disempowering force coming towards 
    you;
3.  Demonstate that you are here, and that you matter;
4.  Your inner power adds potential to men and women; and,
5.  Compassion, not punishment is the answer;

The messages from the following people are especially moving:

Hazelle Goodman, an actor from New York, says, "As a Vigina Warrior,I say to endangered women everywhere, 'Let me hold your broken wing while you fly.'"

Carole Black, President and CEO of Lifetime Entertainment Services, shares, "... I am dedicated to using the power of the mediato inform and support wome on the issues most important to them and their families."

And Gloria Steinem's message in this book says, "... look at the world as if women matter[].."

In this book there are over sixty-five profiles of famous and not so famous Vagina Warriors who come from all over the world.

Their world vision is guided by the compassion and determination that moves women and girls, as well as men towards simultaneous autonomy and connection.

Who could ask for more?
