This is book one of the Circle Trilogy

Hoyt Mac Cionaoith is a wizard that has failed to kill Lilith, a vampire queen that has turned his twin brother Cian into one of her demons.    

The goddess, Morrigan appears to Hoyt, telling him this was only the beginning and that he will have to find the five others that will help him with his quest to destroy Lilith and her demons from taking over all the worlds.  She sends him to 21st century New York where he is to find the witch, the warrior, the scholar, one that shape shifts, and the one that you lost.

The team: Hoyt is reunited with his brother Cian.  Moira, the scholoar and Larkin, the shape-shifter time-travel from Geall where Lilith's band has already terrorized their land.  Glenna is the witch, who has dreamed of Hoyt.  Last to join them, is Blair, who is a demon hunter.    

Along with trying to work together so that they may defeat the vampires before Samhaim, it is also Glenna and Hoyt's touching story of love.  The tale concentrates on these two characters as they both deal in the magical aspects of protecting the team.  The casting of their spells was done honorably, without ever misusing the craft.  

Ms. Robert's has penned a tale of myth, magic and love all into one.  This paranormal romance will surely bewitch you.  I look forward to the next book in the series, where I am sure we will learn more about the other characters of the circle.
