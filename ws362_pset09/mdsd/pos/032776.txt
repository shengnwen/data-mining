This play is very interesting to read (according to me). I saw a lot of  hypocracy and snobery of people in this play.  But a lot of peole said that  the plays of Oscar Wilde have no satire, means, there is no factor of  politics, socials,etc.  I think, what he wrote in this plays and other  plays had something to critize the people in that time.  I want more  information about Lady Winderemere's Fan, I mean what is the background of  Wilde wrote yhis novel. Is there any important effects so that he wrote  this first play
