Joseph Corn's &quot;The Winged Gospel&quot; is a loving study of why many  Americans were fascinated with aviation during the first half of the  twentieth century.  Corn explores the religous flavor which became  associated with the airplane, and how a career in aviation became regarded  as a mystical, &quot;higher calling.&quot;  Corn also examines how the  bombing raids of World War II, especially on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  shattered that optimism.  Corn devotes separate chapters to such phenomenon  as the unique freedoms discovered by women aviators, the belief of &quot;an  airplane in every garage,&quot; and the boundless optimism in the future  brought about by the airplane held by people in the grip of a crippling  depression.  Although his prose tends to be a little dry at times, Corn  manages to coherently present a time when people embraced technology, and  placed all of their hopes in its &quot;miracles.&quot;  As Corn ably  proves, that time is something Americans will probably never see again
