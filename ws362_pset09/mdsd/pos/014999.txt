Once in a while a book speaks so strongly to so many people, that it does the impossible. It is popular and worthwhile.  The best part is that this book gives simple pragmatic execrcises to change communication for the better. Get the book and stay married.  Another great reading that I recommend is "In the meantime"  by Vanzan
