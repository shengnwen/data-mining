The first chapter of &quot;Orphans Preferred&quot; cleverly drives home what seems to be the central point of the book: it's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to separate the &quot;true&quot; Pony Express from the Pony Express of our American mythology.  As daunting as this task is, Corbett, on balance, does an excellent job of presenting what facts are available, as well as describing the myths of the Pony Express with good humor instead of the self-righteous outrage many authors would stoop to. The result is a fascinating book that informs and entertains.  Some may call what Corbett does in &quot;Orphans Preferred&quot; revisionist history (the term even turns up in the book's dust jacket).  I feel that this is unfair, as &quot;revisionist history&quot; suggests twisting history to a particular (usually political) agenda.  Corbett does just the opposite by objecively presenting the facts and the myths regarding the brief but fascinating history of the Pony Express
