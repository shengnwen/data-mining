The encyclopedia is really a good book for general insight, reference, and even getting in to new bands. However, I think that it could use some updates. My primary concern, as others have said, was that it was totally devoid of, or only lacking, some very good artists while including no-ones or one hit wonders. I understand that the books a couple years old, but there were some very good bands thriving then that aren't even mentioned, such as System of A Down. Also, it would have been very handy if the editors had included things such as charts and grammies, etc. In general, however, it is a very good book which will keep anyone interested occupied for a while
