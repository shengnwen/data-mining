My 5 year old daughter loves these books, and we do try to read the particular ones when they are relevent.  We read this before going to the dentist, but now she assumes that she'll get a loose tooth and get it  pulled by the dentist.  I suppose they're reasonably accurate, and they  help allay some childhood fears.  &quot;Dentist Barbie&quot; was almost as  helpful for my daughter when she was three, as this book is now
