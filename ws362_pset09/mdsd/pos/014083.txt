Davidson's Principles and Practices of Medicine is a good overview of the different branches of internal medicine. In particular, Respiratory, Cardiolovascular, Gastrointestinal and Nervous system are well organized, concise and quite informative. It is not a very good source for infectious diseases, rheumatology, nephrology or psychiatry.
I like how the book is organized into a brief introduction to organ physiology, major manifestation of diseases and individual diseases. The section on Liver diseases maybe the best source for learning the subject in this category of books. It might be worth borrowing/buying this book just for that.
