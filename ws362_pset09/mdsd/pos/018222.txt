I'm a military officer, but, I must admit, I didn't know much about the War of 1812.  Having been stationed at Plattsburgh AFB, I knew of the Battle of Plattsburgh, but not its significance.  As it turns out, Mr. Toll's very readable book fills in many gaps in my knowledge, such as this one.  It's a great rendition of the very real people and grand events surrounding the founding of our nation, with the infant US Navy presenting the backdrop and the storyline.  And, it reads like a novel - so much so, in fact, it is one of those rare books that, once started, becomes difficult to put down.

The jacket cover of this book indicates Mr. Toll was a financial analyst by trade.  I hope he's given up that mundane calling, and dedicates himself to writing more exciting stories like this one.  I very much look forward to his next effort.
