In this collection, you'll AVENGERS VOL. 1 # 141-144, 147-149. #'s 145-146 is a different story arc because of deadlines I suppose. 
Anyway, in this collection the Avengers are faced with double trouble: to intercept KANG THE CONQUEROR'S plan to rule the world by going to the 19th century and a crisis in the present time with the ROXXON CORPORATION. Issue # 141 is the set up of the twin crisis, #142-143 deals with the 19th century and 144, 147-150 deals with the climax of the SQUADRON SUPREME saga.
THOR AND MOONDRAGON 9with IMMORTUS' assistance)travel back in time to find their teamate HAWKEYE in the western era. They encounter Marvel's greatest western heroes: TWO GUN KID, KID COLT, RAWHIDE KID, RINGO ETC in a struggle against Kang. The final one on one battle between kang and THE MIGHTY THOR was short but sweet as well as when they took the TWO GUN KID back with them to the 20th century.
As a kid, this was one of the very first times I have really seen THE VISION against 3 Squadron members including their most poerful member: HYPERION, and quite literally ran over him. The other battles with CAPTAIN AMERICA, IRON MAN , THE BEAST & THE HELLCAT (this is also the very first time Patsy Walker donned the Catsuit)against DOC SPECTRUM, THE WHIZZER, AMPHIBION, TOM THUMB ETC(JLA RIP -OFFS). were also well drawn and quite fast-paced ala GEORGE PEREZ(one of my favorite artists)
THE HIGHTLIGHT OF THIS COLLECTION I BELIEVE IS: Thor taking on Kang alone, The Vision taking on HYPERION(marvel's Superman rip-off)and the first appearance of the Hellcat.
A good read for any 70's comic fan. It was well beyond its time. 
Also: DO NOT MISS STRACYNSKI'S SUPREME POWER, starring HYPERION. 
I have the comic collection, get the T
