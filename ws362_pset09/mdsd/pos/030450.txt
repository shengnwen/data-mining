This book wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  I was expecting a book on how to pick advisors like accountants, real estate brokerss, lawyers, etc.  However this book was about creating a team that works according to a "code of honor" that is created by the team.  

Essentially the code of honor is a set of rules that the team creates and lives by in order to maintain a high level of accountability and performance.  The idea makes sense as teams and people and general need rules by which to live by.  Author Blair Singer does a good job of organizing the information and presenting it in an easy to read fashion.  

On the downside, I wish there were more examples in this book to illistrate the points he's makes.  A list of rules would have been nice, or the lists of rules that some other companies have come up with.

However other than that, the book is well done.  Anyone wanting to build a team or wanting to improve the accountability of their existing team should pick up this book.  4 out of 5 stars
