The book is beautiful.  If you are a dog lover, I highly recommend it.  It will make you cry and make you know how special our 4-legged buddies are.  
Thank you for documenting these stories and sharing them with us.  It helps to remind us, beautifully I might add, of one of the darkest and most horrific days in our short history.  This is a day we should never forget.
