This is without question the most important book in my life. A huge portion of my adolescence was spent clutching my mom's dog-eared copy, pouring over each essay, article, review, excerpt and rant again and again and again...Lester's explosive, visceral, hilarious style is well-documented, and it's part of what makes this tome so addictive. Ditto his incisive, unforgiving criticism--of culture and society and himself as much as music.
 
 But the REAL story here is the man's soul. My life hasn't been much like Lester's at all (thankfully), and I count myself a more or less functional member of society who DOESN'T need to drink a half-gallon of wine and a handful of valiums just to stand being around people. But at the same time, I feel an incredible intellectual, emotional, and spiritual affinity for Lester--HE IS MY FRIEND, even though I never knew him, even though he died when I was all of 2 years old. Lester was an incredible person--a deeply troubled man, yes, but one with a much purer soul than any of the other cultural martyrs of the 20th century, living or dead (Burroughs, Ginsberg, Bukowski, Hunter Thompson, Keith Richards, Jim Morrison, Sid Vicious, Lou Reed, etc.). To read his work is to touch a tiny piece of that--because he wrote absolutely without compromise (which is why Jann Wenner didn't put up with him for long). I have felt moments of a similar understanding with other writers, but never this vividly.
 
 Don't just buy this book. Buy it and keep it within arm's reach as often as possible. At once toweringly intelligent and frankly unpretentious; unflappably cool and openly vulnerable...I quite simply have never found another book like it, though the more recently compiled Main Lines, Blood Feasts and Bad Taste is a worthy companion.
 
 You may notice that almost none of this review seems to be about music, but trust me, it is. Lester will make you think of music as a part of everything we do, just as everything we do becomes a part of music
