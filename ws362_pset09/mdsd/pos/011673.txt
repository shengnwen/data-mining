I have them all,...1st editions which are probably worth nothing, because his publisher knows he can write too. In my house, for mainstream writing, there are only a few authors worthy of buying EVERY book... Grisham is the only one my wife (she of more like Oprah's club fandom) and I agree on. We fight to see who gets to read Grisham's book 1st.
Read them all...outside of Brett Favre and Steve McNair, this has to be Mississipi's best statesmen.
Keep it up Joh
