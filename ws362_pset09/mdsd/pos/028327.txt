I just finished, much to my dismay, Joy In the Morning.  I couldn't put this book down over the weekend.  Smith's character development is incredibly strong and her dialogue is excellently realistic.  I have been away from reading for some time for various, no-good-reason reasons, and when I found this book I had meant to read in high school...and then college...I decided to give it a go and am ready to read again, often.  It was truly a delight.  The plot captured me immediately and I felt as though I quickly got to know Carl and Annie intimately.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for a laid-back read that touches on many emotions and the common hardships/adjustments that come with starting a new life with someone.  5 stars, without a doubt
