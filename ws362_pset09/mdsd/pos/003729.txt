a telling story of one woman's mission to protect the gorilla community of Rwanda from extinction.  Her compassion & relentless determination for the safety of these animals is beyond admirable, as she sets out to educate the people of Rwanda on the value of the gorillas' lives.  Through various obstacles, Amy Vedder manages to successfully make a difference in the population & preservation of these fine animals.  Her story is truly inspiring & topical.  Highly recommended for ages 12 & up
