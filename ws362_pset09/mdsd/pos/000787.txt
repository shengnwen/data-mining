While not the best in the series, a big improvement over &quot;J&quot; is for Judgement (the weakest in the series, so far). Did Sue Grafton actually write that one??? &quot;K&quot; is for Killer brings back the Kinsey Millhone of the earlier books. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the ending, but overall a good read. Looking forward to reading &quot;L&quot; is for Lawless now
