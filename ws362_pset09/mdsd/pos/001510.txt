You know you're in for a long read when the original hardcover came in two volumes!  But anyone familiar with Michener knows not to be put off by that.  As with his other "fictionalized histories," the stories here - and there are many - are a fairly good reflection of what really happened in the place being profiled.  This time, it's South Africa, and the time span is from prehistory to 1979, with a heavier concentration on more recent decades.

Writing just over a decade before apartheid fell, Michener really does seem to have tried to comprehend the incomprehensible as to how that shameful chapter of history came to pass.  As usual, his anti-heroes are presented evenhandedly, leaving the reader to recognize their flaws.  There are, of course, plenty of those, and they at least keep the very long book flowing pretty well.  Throughout the 1200 or so pages, his historical research is impressive as always.  The book's one shortcoming is that it does try to encompass so much over such a long time, so after a while its own references to past events become confusing to the reader.  Helpfully, there are genealogy charts for the major families in the back of the book, but even those sometimes left me barely able to recall the events referred to a few hundred pages down the road.

And how does it all end?  Without giving anything away, I can say it's interesting in retrospect to see what Michener - or at least his characters - were expecting in 1979 and when they thought it would come to pass.  If you like his other historical epics, you'll probably like this one too
