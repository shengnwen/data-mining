This is a monumental work of history.  Thanks to the efforts of Natalie Curtis and other recorders in the early twentieth century, there are many songs and stories of American Indians which have not been lost.  The 149 songs recorded (in their original language and in translation), the myths and legends, and the interviews are from tribes all over the United States.  These groups include the Wabanaki, Dakota, Pawnee, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Winnebago, Kwakiutl, Pima, Apache, Mojave-Apache, Yuma, Navajo, Zuñi, San Juan, Acoma, Laguna, and Hopi.  This is a reference book to be treasured
