I like how liberals rate a book before reading it. They see a book about Bush and they hate it. Please liberals buy the book or check it out at the library first, then rate it with your honest opinion. Anyways about the book, I agree its not the greatest book, but its decent enough to read if you're interested in knowing about our President
