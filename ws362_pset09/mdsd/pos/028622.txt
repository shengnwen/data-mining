I would have given this book 5 stars, but for the last third of the content.  The majority of the book, Mr. Hayek presents a convincing case for individual liberty, and the price mechanism, (unfettered by government interference), being the best transmitter of dispersed knowledge.  The last third of the book, however, Mr. Hayek seems to ally himself with the &quot;collectivists&quot; in promoting public housing, public education, etc., something he had railed against earlier in what he dismissively called &quot;social justice&quot;.  That doesn't seem consistent.  For those looking for a more concise book, I'd recommend &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, which is a lot shorter, and competely consistent, across the board.  Next up for me...Thomas Sowell's &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, and Milton Friedman's &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot;
