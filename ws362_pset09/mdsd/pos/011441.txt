The book that I read was "Private Peaceful" and I thought that it was a very good book.  This is what is about.  It startes a few years before World WarI it takes place in Germany the father just died and the mother has to raise three boys all by her self.  It is hard but she does it the best she can.  Charlie gets married to molly just before the war.  Then charlie and Tom the Peaceful Brothers, go fight for their country. charlie gets hurt and he gets to come home and leaves Tom behind.  Then he comes back and then gets sent the firing spuad for disobeying orders and is executed.  There is a lot meore than just that, so if you want to read a good book this is the one to read
