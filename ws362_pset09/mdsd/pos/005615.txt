I have often wondered what Jane's life was *really* like.  Having read every one of her books and seen most of the movies, I often wondered if she was like any of her heroines.  In reading this book, I began to understand her situation more.  A woman who was reliant on her brothers for a place to live, and money to spend, but who exercised a spirit of independence in her written word.  

Honestly, while I can see why Cass mutilated Jane's letters after her death, I think that it is truly a shame because we will never know what she was thinking during that period of her life where she wasn't writing at all, or at any of the other difficult times of her life.  

Tomalin's book was well researched and brought me into Jane's life as no other book has done.  I thought it was interesting to watch Jane's growth as a writer.  I was left with the thought that Jane imbued her heroines with a part of herself.  Whether it is Lizzie's intelligence, or Anne Elliot's situation in life, Jane's life was full of interesting events and people. Tomalin's book allowed Jane to shine.  A must read
