I absolutely loved this book!  I was so inspired by Lydia that I didn't want the book to end.  She was truly a modern woman living in a past time.  She did the best she could do with what she had; loved, lost, and went on, trying to make her small world a better place.  Indeed, I felt a better person for having known her
