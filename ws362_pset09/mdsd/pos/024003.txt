The late D. Scott Rogo was one of the most prolific writers on paranormal phenomena, and also one of the few who did the legwork to check out the facts on his own. Although his writing is sometimes a little sloppy (subject-verb agreement seems to be a problem), his thinking is always clear and sensible. Far from being a true believer, Rogo takes skeptical objections seriously, sometimes accepting their validity, at other times debunking the debunkers by looking more closely into their assertions. (His research into the much-maligned &quot;counting horse,&quot; Clever Hans, is fascinating, and his demolition of magician James Randi's unfounded attacks on parapsychologists Puthoff and Targ is invaluable. Both subjects are covered in the book's last chapter, &quot;The Failure of Skepticism.&quot;) Rogo looks at the so-called Mars Effect, ESP in animals and humans, afterlife and reincarnation evidence (and its weaknesses), shamanism, and other issues in this fast-paced, compact survey of the field.
