While this is a beautiful book and still well worth the money, I was a bit disappointed with the written history within. While the title says "Yankee Stadium", this is in essence a chronological history of the Yankees, with a little more emphasis on the stadium (mainly in pictures and captions), than other books.

Many of the photos are great (especially the image of DiMaggio overlooking a gutted stadium during renovations) and the captions are well written. But the text, in my opinion, glances over the details of the stadium. For example, the only mention of the fact that a major addition was added to the left field grandstand in 1928 was a small caption to a photo. Also, the renovations of 1974-75, which totally remodeled the stadium (and stripped it of much of it's old charm), is mentioned only briefly. 

Most of the text in the book is about the players and how the team did on the field, which would be fine if the book were titled "The Yankees". But I was hoping for the writing to be more focused on the stadium itself (stories from the builders, the vendors, and the players about the stadium; how the renovations were done, etc.) Alas, there is very little of this in the book.


I give this book 4 out of 5 stars for the pictures and due to the fact there are so few other books solely about Yankee Stadium. I'm still waiting for the definitive history of Yankee Stadium (which sadly will replaced in 2009). This is not it
