I thought this book was really good.  If you read my report l think you should read the book.  It is about a man and his boy.  His father is a farmer and one day the boy comes out and helps his father.  Then they hit the top of  a volcano.  Which is in the ground and it destroys everything.  Then they rebuild everything
