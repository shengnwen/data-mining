This cookbook for the younger reader is wonderful.  This book is easy to understand, filled with many pictures, that not only gives recipes, but also teaches various cooking techniques.  Williams Sonoma has a wonderful way of creating cookbooks for the younger people that have not only creative recipes, but recipes for foods that we eat every day.  I highly recommend this cookbook for your young novice cook
