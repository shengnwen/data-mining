  The authors of this government manual admit right off that it is aimed at the Caped Crimefighter class of superhero, those who set out to fight evil with nothing but their expertise in martial arts and/or genius for inventing useful gadgetry. However it also has some useful tips for those of us who've gained strange powers through the bite of radioactive animals, scientific experiments gone awry and the like.

  The illustrations are rather hilariously dated, but this is a government publication after all.
