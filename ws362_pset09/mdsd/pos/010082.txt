I have admired the teachings and writings of His Holiness The Dali Lama. He speaks to all in a way that is both profound, yet down to Earth. Living in the United States all of my forty years I have noticed that we can be someone who can lean toward personal interests. I am not suggesting, in anyway, that we don't have neighbors who are very compassionate toward strangers. If we follow the guidance of His Holiness, we can learn and teach others to live a kinder life. I have several books containing his words of wisdom. Through his words I have gained strength during uncertain times. My honor to him is to share my kindness to all those who may cross my path
