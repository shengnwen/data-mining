Dave Barry's work always seems to mix very clever, witty, laugh-out-loud humor with attempts at absurdity (I'm thinking of the zucchini jokes) that just aren't clever or funny.  The closer he sticks to reality, the funnier he is.  There's lot of skewered reality in this book, zucchini notwithstanding, and it's well worth the read.  Don't miss Dave's version of the U.S. Constitution
