Before you start reading, note that there is a sequel to this novel. I read this book not realizing there would be a sequel, and when I came to the end hoping to have all my questions answered and to have some sort of "closure," I was at first dismayed to realize it was merely the beginning. However, it couldn't have ended in a better way (I wont spoil anything) and leaves you hungry to read the next installment. The stage is set for so many possibilities, that its exciting to see where The Exhile will take us.... 

If you even remotely like historical fiction,  you will LOVE this book! Its brilliantly researched, very plausible and true to the times. The character development and story-telling ability is first-rate. The court-intrigue is not overly done as in other novels. Additionally, the author has a wonderful ability to write time-appropriate dialogue. 

If you enjoy Philippa Gregory, you'll LOVE Posie Graeme-Evans!
