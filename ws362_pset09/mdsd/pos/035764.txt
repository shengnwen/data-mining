What we have here are over 100 op-ed pieces (about 2 1/2 book pages each) that ran in the San Francisco Examiner over a three-year period, December 1985 thru November 1988 and are now compiled in Gonzo Papers Volume 2 (Volume 1 was The Great Shark Hunt).  These were originally meant to be read at the rate of one a week, but of course you can increase your speed on this compilation.  However, I read them in a handful of sittings and suffered from severe overload.  First of all, at this fast rate you get a good deal of duplication that waters down the overall affect Thompson was trying to create in his weekly column.  Thompson reminds me of the famous Groucho Marx line:  "Whatever it is, he's against it!"  Just picked at random:  "Any baboon with a healthy heart and good diction... could do Neil Frank's job (director of the National Hurricane Center).  President Reagan: "...seems to be dumber than three mules."  Frank Sinatra: "...is said to be smart, but he was fired and cut off from every casino in New Jersey when he tried to play blackjack by rules he learned in Nevada...They chased him out like a wino.  It was an ugly thing to see."  And these quotes all come from just one article.  Pick a name or event from the headlines of these three years and you'll find a bombastic opinion from Thompson aimed directly at it.  It is a fun and funny read.  You'll find yourself thinking and speaking in the Thompson style.  It's addictive.  But, too much at one time can put you over the top.  For more reasons than one, this would make for good bathroom reading material
