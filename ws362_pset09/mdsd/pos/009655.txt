Greene's book does a good job of providing a woodworker (or others interested in period pieces) with solid information on many selected pieces from the era of the title.  He does a good job of selecting pieces of good taste, and gives a lot of information on various details with just the right amount of how-to.  There is also a lot of historical background info for those who like to know about the history of a piece or style before they build it.  The pictures and exploded drawings (showing joinery) are excellent.  Though not a comprehensive encyclopedia (it's not intended to be one) it is a good read from start to finish or a good reference book.  Well worth the money
