This is a wonderful little book and shows, believe it or not, the &quot;tender&quot; side of General Jackson. While the mere mention of Jackson's immortal sobriquet, &quot;Stonewall,&quot; would strike fear in the hearts of Union Army commanders, his wife would one day write of, &quot;...that tender and exquisite phase of his inner life.&quot; This book reveals Jackson as a &quot;humble Christian and loving husband father&quot; and bolsters the contention that Jackson is a worthy hero for men and boys today. Buy the book. (Rick Williams, author of &quot;The Maxims of Robert E. Lee for Young Gentlemen.&quot;
