I personally read this book many years ago, and found it to be one of the most interesting accounts of personal history I have ever read. John Fire Lame Deer lead a life as many things, but one thing is for sure he 'lived' his life and lived it like no other. Everytime I see this book on my shelves, I pick it up and read it all over again. From childhood to manhood walk side by side with one of the most interesting people in all of history. *Wink* click my name above
