100 Q&A books tend to answer, well, 100 questions.  Haing read the book I believe it is a good introduction to lymphoma from a new patient, family member, or loved one.  Information is written very clearly and you do not have to wade through ten chapters to find a specific nuggent of information.

The format does have the limitation that each subject mentioned is not explored in-depth compared to some of the other books in the same class.  While very good for an introduction, if a patient is down into treatment or trying to decide on a specific treatment among choices, you'll want to look at another text.

But if one of my "family & friends" wanted to learn just a bit more after hearing I was diagnosed (if diagnosed today) I'd recommend this book.  For my caregiver, I'd steer them towards more complete texts like Living with Lymphoma or maybe even the more medically oriented books Hodgkin's Disease or The Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas both by Mauch et al
