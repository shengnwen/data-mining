I subscribe to The Progressive, so I read Ivins' current work monthly in that publication, as well as any time she appears in the paper.  And actually, I have not been a huge fan.  I have felt that she mainly repeats the center-left mantras of the day, and works somewhat over-hard to craft and maintain the image of folksy, curmudgeonly, old-guard Southern progressivism.  But I found this collection of older columns for $1 in the clearance section of a used book store, and found it to exceed my expectations.  These columns, mainly from the 70s and 80s, are rich in the kind of political commentary that is genuinely edifying.  For me, they provide a window on a time that I am too young to remember well (or at all), and teach me about the continuity between the political climate of that time and today.  

But more than that, Ivins knows Texas politics as intimately as anyone.  If you are not from Texas, as I am not, you might think that you are not especially interested in the culture and history of the Texas legislature.  Or you might think that one state legislature is pretty much the same as any other.  But I think you'll be surprised at the degree to which Ivins' "Texas Leg" columns are both entertaining and insightful.  She may beat some jokes into the ground sometimes, but this book belongs in the library of any connoisseur of political commentary.
