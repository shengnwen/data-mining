Language is power. Heath, a reflective practitioner of both human nature and schooling, provides an in-depth view of communities which epitomize the  struggle for such power.  In her ethnographic study of Trackton and  Roadville, Heath lays bare the socializing process of children through  words.  The discontinuity between home and school is disturbing; a  realization that students who do not fit the traditional way of schooling  are left behind.  Clearly illustrated is the need for teachers and students  to bridge the gap which exists in relation to both language and culture,  for without this effort some students will never acquire the power needed  to take control of their education or pursue opportunities from which they  have previously been excluded.   This is must reading for student  ethnographers, doctoral students, and those dedicated to school reform,  particularly those in the areas of diversity in public schools, and  language. This extraordinary book compares favorably to &quot;Growing Up  Literate: Learning From Inner-City Families&quot; by Denny Taylor &amp;  Catherine Dorsey-Gaines
