This is essentially a comic book, yet it is able to communicate the fundamental laws of physics taught in an introductory high school physics course and some taught in college such as relativity.  Overall, the book is enjoyable and humorous.  However, the constraints of actually teaching the material through the drawings do impose on the humor sometimes.  The book is accurate, as far as I can tell, and allows one to gain some understanding on how things work, from how the tides come about, to the motion of a gyroscope, to the Theory of Relativity.  One disclaimer that I must add, that should be obvious, is that unless you are sufficient in mathematics (genius) you will not know all the consequences that come out from these laws other than the ones provided to you.  I would have to recommend this for people over 12 years old, those who want to learn a little physics in a fun and entertaining way.
