When Miss Julia's husband, Sam, and her friend Hazel Marie both go on a trip at the same time, Miss Julia feels lonely.  She has a party for 25 of her dearest friends, and she is shocked to find that during the party several of her best pieces of jewelry have disappeared.  She is especially upset to find that her wedding and engagement rings are missing.  Never one to sit back and be passive, Miss Julia decides to take matters into her own hands and try to find the thieves who have taken her jewelry.  She finds out that Palm Beach Florida is the center of the jewelry theft ring and she sets out with Lloyd and Etta Mae Wiggins to find the perpetrators.  She is in search of Mr. Tuttle, a private investigator, but she is not pleased at what she finds when she meets him.  This is another enjoyable book chronicling the adventures of the prim Presbyterian.  Author Ann B. Ross is able to laugh at her own plot when she has her characters remark at how amazing it is when all the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place.  It's all in good fun and that's what this series is all about
