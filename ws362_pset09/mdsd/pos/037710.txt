This is a fun, easy book to read, with plenty of concise, common-sense advice. My problem with this book is the same as I had with Raving Fans, which is that the obviously fictional story makes me question the validity of the claims of how well the system works. 

The authors claim that it's based on a true story, with names changed to protect the innocent. Okay, but most business books are based on real events at real companies, so this approach doesn't necessarily make sense for this genre of writing. 

It's still fun, and the advice still makes sense, but the style makes me wonder about the credibility
