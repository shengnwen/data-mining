I started LOVE WALKED IN right after the new year.  I read about a third of it and then started something else.  For some reason I'd gotten bored with it and wasn't sure I wanted to finish it.  Cornelia was a little too interesting.  Clare a little too mature for a child.  Martin a little too strange.  But a few days ago I'd left the book I was reading downstairs in my car and it was too cold to go down and get it so I picked this up and haven't put it down since.  It captured me immediately.  I guess I was in the right frame of mind to read it - maybe I need it now and hadn't needed it before.  

I love this story.  I love reading about love and how people experience it, one way or another.  I love reading about the loss of things in our lives and how we end up being rewarded, if we're lucky, when we rediscover truths because of these losses.  And Marisa de los Santos does a beautiful job writing about these things.  Her words pull you into the story and as it should be with a truly good book, you get lost as though you're part of Cordelia's life and experiencing it all first hand.  

And then there's Teo.  I fall in love with Teo.  I want him to be my friend, my doctor, my lover.  I want him in my life and while I'm reading this, he is.  

This book lures you into its beauty and safety and delight and you find yourself totally enraptured in every word, every sentence.  Enjoy
