This again is a continuation of her New England/Texas series and as always has the secretive leading lady(s) and the strong, pushy male.  It was a good mystery but you figure early on whodunit but so what... We wanted to see it heat up.  Unfortunately, I wish she would have dealt more with Kara and Sam and less of everyone else.  Ms. Neggers tends to bring in more &amp; more characters when all I really want to do it hear about all the old ones.  Still, I highly recommend it and would keep it along with my favorite &quot;Finding You&quot;
