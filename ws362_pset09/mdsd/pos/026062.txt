I can't believe just how much this book and the others in the Pocket Ref. series actually contain.  As a full time engineering student, welder, and DIY'er, I don't think I'll ever need to know anything that isn't within the contents of this book.  From frictional losses, to fasteners, to every type of conversion imaginable, it can be found in these pocket ref books.  How I lived without them is a mystery to me
