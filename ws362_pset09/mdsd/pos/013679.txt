   There is no such thing as alternative history, to which some scholars alude.  There is only the history that we have been taught and the history that actually existed.  Graham does a masterful job of reexaming the evidences of our past and resifts the sands of time, so to speak, in order to examine evidence for past civilizations on our planet.  He is both knowledgable and believable in his assertions about the root origins of human kind. I believe it is essential to question "commonly known" history in order to arrive closer to true fact.  Thanks to schollars like Graham Hancock, we now have an option.  This book is a very good read.
