Terrific writing and story line.  You wont be able to stop thinking about it all day long till you finish it!  Excellent twists through out the whole thing too.  The story just keeps getting deeper and more twisted.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of Tess' books.  

Definately pick up this book!
