This is one of my favorite books by Stephen King but I think sometimes its gets overlooked.  The Dark Half is about author Thad Beaumont who has made many fans and $$ with his books using a pen name, George Stark.  When Thad decides he wants to "kill" Stark off and write on his own again, that's when the trouble begins.  Stark doesn't want to die and in a sense comes to life and starts killing people who helped in his destruction and all this leads back to Thad. There's lot's of murder/gore and Stark is a frightening character that you'll have to read to find out more about.  This book is really creepy and well written and it has Sheriff Pangborn, from Needful Things, is an earlier role which was fun to read.  I really like this book and it still remains what of my favorites
