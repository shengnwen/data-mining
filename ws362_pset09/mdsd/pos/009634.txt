This was my first Koontz book (since then I've read many) and I think it's still my favorite.  One reviewer said it "will likely let you down, unless your favorite theme in Koontz's books is the transcendence of horror by uplifting spirituality".  Well, yes!  That's the whole reason I read Koontz books - otherwise I don't think I'd be able to sleep at night!  I love the redemption twist he writes into many of his stories (The Face, anyone?).  Anyone can write straight horror without hope, but Koontz acknowledges a bigger picture, and I hope he keeps it up
