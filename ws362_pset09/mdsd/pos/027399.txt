In this second adventure of Odelia Grey, the plus size sleuth is back and better ten ever.  From the opening paragraph to the exciting climaz, this novel has it all.
Odelia is sent by her boss, Mike 'the pain' Steele, to notarize papers for millionaire client Sterling Price.  While there, she gets the grand tour of Sterling collection of vintage lunchboxes.  On display are Zorro, Roy Rogers, Hop-a-Long, and even the type Odelia's mother had made her carry- the hated 'Junior Miss'.  Sterling proudly shows her the 'holy pail', the protoype from an old TV western star who was murdered in 1949.
After Odelia tells the other people in her office about the collection, Sterling is murdered and the pail is missing.  Detective Frye rules out Odelia as a suspect but many shady characters believe that she has the missing pail.  Putting herself in danger, she is determined to find whoever murdered Sterling and recover the lost pail.
Jaffarian has a way of making her characters come alive on the page.  She draws each one so realistically that each has their own freshness.  Jaffarian is a writer with the skills to create believable characters and plots.  There are just enough twist and turns that keeps the story flowing effortlessly.
Just Odelia's visit to her father's family is worth the price of admission.  In addition, I must not forget a cookie recipe that even I could follow.
Does Odelia solve the murder of Sterling Price? Why is there a curse on the lunch pail?  Does she find the 'holy pail'?  What lunch pail did Odelia want as a child?  How is Odelia's love life going?  All the answers and more lie within "The Curse of the Holy Pail".  I enjoyed this soft-boiled mystery series by this extremely talented writer.  Midnight Ink publisher has a winning series on their hands
