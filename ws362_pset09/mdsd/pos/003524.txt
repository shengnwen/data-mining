As Wilson points out in his author's note, these are not your namby-pamby Anne Rice vampires....there are no Byronic self-tortured lamenting-existence souls in this novel...mostly.

It's an enjoyable read with a worthy ending.  Definitely recommended.

A couple nice points:

1) The vampires have taken over and they're nasty.  They sweep through the old world and arrive at the new, turning society on it's heels.  I've always the apocalyptic future world concept and Wilson does a pretty good job here, where the survivors band together trying to survive.

2) The vampires exist in something of a generational hierarchy here...the further down the vamp chain it is, the more feral is the person who is turned by it.  An interesting idea and, while not developed fully as a plot point, when this discussion occurs in the story, it makes the head vamp that much more nasty.

One thing I didn't like:  it seems that we can't have a hero in a vampire story without being a vampire...what's with that?  As much as Wilson rails on the Anne Rice vamp, he manages to churn out an equally self-loathing woe-is-me character who becomes the protagonist in the story.

The above point aside, I still very much recommend it
