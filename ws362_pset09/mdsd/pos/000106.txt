I was relieved to find a book that focused on what a good time dating could be with the right attitude, instead of how to cut corners to get to the nearest altar. Approaching people and enduring first dates has gotten a  lot easier. There's so many ideas and bits of advice that I'll be referring  to this book a lot in the future
