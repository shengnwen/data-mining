This book was brought to my attention by my daughter when I was diagnosed as suffering from  clinical depression in the fall of 1995.  I found it very helpful, full of information on the illness, on the different treatments available.  The possible link between depression and addiction made me realize that what I thought of as a weakness for over-the-counter medication (with codeine, and others) could have been a way of trying to cope with a depressive state of mind.  A must-read for people suffering from different mood disorders, and for their families, it offers good advice, lots of case examples, and helps realize that, when one suffers from depression, or other related disorder, it is an illness, not a weakness of caracter, or laziness.  This book helped me better understand  my illness and to cope with the ups and downs of treatment
