Stop Stealing Sheep is an introductory essay on typography and why it works. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how the authors take the tenets of typography and relate them to every day examples, giving the reader a deeper understanding of the concepts that are being explained. The reader need not be experienced in typography to understand this book. Indeed, the book is geared toward the beginner and no technical knowledge of the art of typography is required. Anyone who prepares texts for publication will be able to produce better type after having read this book. The only negative thing that can be said about the book is that in a couple of chapters the authors use yellow text for the side bar text which is extremely annoying to try to read against a white background. Perhaps the authors were trying to make a point by showing the reader how annoying text in certain colors can be. They certainly succeeded if that was the case. In any case it was poor choice for a whole chapter's worth of side bar text. Additionally, in an attempt to give the reader a wide range of typographic examples, some of the body text is difficult to read. More than likely this is because the authors are giving us first hand examples of how typographic choices can affect readability, and it does succeed in that. These gripes are on the whole, minor points, and the book does not really suffer overly much for it. Stop Stealing Sheep is definitely a book that belongs in every designer's library.
