This book is a handy intro to American architecture. It helps to have a bit of a background before reading it, although a beginner wouldn't have too much trouble figuring things out. I use it as a quick reference and an easy way to study, but I wouldn't recommend it for really detailed research. It is exactly what it says: a field giude. The illustrations are concise and easy to read, and the descriptions are brief but specific. The glossary is good for basic terms, but probably not as useful for intricacies.
