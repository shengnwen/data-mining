I've thumbed through many a poster book at my local bookstores but this one I just had to own!  Probably because 'exploitation' movies are my favorite guilty pleasure cinema.  Assembled here is some great art,  when movie posters actually leapt off of the paper they were drawn on--to get in your face.  New movie poster artists should get this book as a reference for their ad campaigns (and you can tell some are starting to...) In an age of such:  passiveness in film, where everything is rated PG-13, it's nice to reflect on this golden age of poster art for films, that mostly, delivered what they advertised. A worthy purchase for the film fan
