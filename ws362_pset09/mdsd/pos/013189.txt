I wanted to take the opportunity to recommend this book to anyone who has wondered why every place in America looks like everywhere else.  There's a funny line in the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie where "our heros" are traveling by car across America in a race against time to foil the plan of the arch villan. As they pass the same gas station and fast food franchise again and again Bullwinkle says, "Haven't we been here before?"  That was the same reaction my seven-year old had this summer when we were on our family vacation.  We were in Richmond, Virginia and he said we've been here before because I remember that place over there.  I had to explain to him what franchise architecture was and how just about every town in America has one of those types of buildings.  This is a sad commentary on the American landscape that we as consumers expect the to see the familiar sign of our favorite business.  This is one reason why I wrote this book; to let folks know that there's a better way. In fact, we used to do it better.  The types of places that capture our attention and long to live are the places that were built prior to World War II.  The small towns that so many families idealize as the place they'd rather raise their kids are the same places that couldn't be built today because of "modern" zoning ordinances.  And the sad thing is today's generation is the first to be raised totally in a suburban environment that requires owning an automobile just to survive.  If you're intersted in how this could change and what the alternatives are Community by Design is your book! There's 250 illustrations and photos that show you what's possible right now.  The book helps you understand why community can and should be designed and lets you see some places where it has been. If you ask me this is a great book.  ..
