This wonderful book captures the essence of what it takes to hire right the first time.  The author is obviously an expert in the field of screening, interviewing and hiring.  She shares that expertise with the reader in an organized, logical and practical manner.  The book is easy to pick up and put down.  I love Carol Hacker's books.  She's an excellent writer - really knows her stuff!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to quickly become a more effective manager when it comes to hiring new people
