The Tolkien boxed set arrived when it was promised to, and of course, the books were more informative then the movie. I recommend it for anyone who loved the movies. And if you haven't seen the movies read these first. Now I am anxious to see if they come out with a movie about the first book in the series (The Hobbit).
