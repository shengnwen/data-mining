I've looked at a lot of knot books from people like Ashley, Budworth, and Pawson. This is easily one of the best! It's very user-friendly, with clear instructions and good drawings. Most of the knots are practical so it isn't cluttered with esoteric fancy knots that do nothing. My only caveat is a bit more could be said about pros and cons of various knots
