If you're a novice looking for a step-by-step how-to book, keep looking.  This volume is for the modeler who already has some experience with building and painting kits, but perhaps hasn't yet worked with human figures much.  There are handy tips here, it's just that the emphasis is on customizing figures and creating a backdrop for them.  Armstrong is a modeler who places a premium on accuracy, and his comments on achieving the proper detailing for his figures are informative and reveal the broader educational opportunities inherent in this hobby.  There is also a helpful bibliography included.  As far as modeling itself, the strength of this book is in the imaginative and ingenious ways in which Armstrong creates convincing, interesting sets for his figures, and for this aspect alone, the book is well worth the price.  Highly recommended for the serious enthusiast
