If you haven't heard of Ko Un, take note. This Korean poet is a former Buddhist monk and a two-time Nobel Prize-nominee for literature. The fall book season sees the release of two English translations of his work, a novel and a collection of poetry (Ten Thousand Lives from Green Integer). An accessible introduction to Ko Un, Little Pilgrim is a fictional tale based on the Avatamsaka or "Flower Garland" sutra, one of the most influential scriptures in East Asian Buddhism. It's the story of a young boy, Sudhana, who sets out on a journey and meets fifty-three teachers-Buddhist, spirit, and otherwise-who help him to become a bodhisattva. Ko Un has rendered it as an engaging narrative that will be a treasure for a young, modern audience, fulfilling a promise he made to his teacher more than thirty years ago
