So you've looked in your local health food store and seen the &quot;Veggie Ribs&quot; and &quot;Chiken Patties&quot; mixes and thought, &quot;Ya,  right! &quot; Well think again! The mixes in and of themselves are  surprisingly wonderful. Great for families where all members are not  vegetarian. They can fool the most ferocious meat-eater. Once you try one,  you'll want to try more. Enter this book. It is a great tool for learning a  variety of ways in which to incorporate textured soy into your diet through  the use of these wonderful mixes. The recipes in this book are terrific,  for example, try the Smokey Mountain Barbecue Chiken Tenders or the Chiken  Breasts Dijon. Besides tasting great, the recipes are all very low in fat,  but high in nutritional value (nutritional information is given for all  recipes) and very easy. If you thought eating soy meant eating only tofu,  try this book and open up a world of better health and taste! Your family  will thank you for it
