As a practicing Ob/Gyn for the last 20 years as well as a Christian, I am familiar with the sensitive issues surrounding a happy fulfilling sex life in marriage. Dr. Cutrer handles these issues with expertise which is founded both in his experience as a gynecologist and his obvious thorough knowledge of the scriptures. I have strongly recommended this book for many of my patients, as well as members of my family. God wants us to fully enjoy our partners in marriage and do so mutually. This book goes a long way toward dispelling many myths, taboos and misconceptions about what God whould have us get out of our physical relationships! I can't recommend this book highly enough. As the author of two books myself, I can tell you that this text's organization, content and readability are critically excellent as well. Any married couple, Christian or otherwise, should get a copy of this book!  J.M. Thurston, MD, FACO
