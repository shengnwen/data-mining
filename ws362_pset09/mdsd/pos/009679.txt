I finally got my hands on the KJV Cameo Reference Edition with Concordance and Dictionary Black calfskin with zip thanks to the great people at Amazon the only company I trust when buying on-line...they give great customer service.   Bookshops here in the Philippines don't carry Cambridge bibles so we have to order them abroad.  One of the first things you notice about the cameo cambrdige bible is the craftsmanship that went into its production.  The Calfskin leather binding is indeed a joy to hold, supple but strong. The type is so readable they seem to jump out of the pages.  Of course nothing beats the cadence of the King James version of the Holy Bible, it is unsurpassed for devotional reading and inspiration.  Mine has the zipper closure that will protect the gold edged  pages for a very very long time. The references, dictionary, concordance and maps make this handy sized bible a veritable treasure of bible helps.  As a Pastor I own several bibles and versions, but none can compare with the quality of the Cameo reference King James Bible. It may cost more than the regular bibles available here but hey they don't make bibles like these anymore.   If the Bible is the eternal word of God, doesn't it make sense to purchase one that will last a lifetime
