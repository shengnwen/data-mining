This disaster is little known, even in Chicago.  Since I live in the West Suburbs, it is interesting to read this story about the disaster that killed 844 people.  Even the death rate is suspect, since some claim it was more, and some less.  The Chicago Fire and the Iroquous Theater Fire claimed less than this disaster.  Yet, Chicago people remember the fire and forget about the Eastland.  
The author does a service in putting a human spin on this tragic event.  Hundreds of people died in this disaster.  These were hard working immigrants and their families who were hoping for a pleasureable cruise.  The author limits his story to the human aspect of the disaster.  As Bonansinga would say, another book has investigated that aspect and his story is about the human beings that were affected.  There were a few memorable experiences about this book.  The fireman carrying a dead child from the boat.  A whole family wiped out because of the disaster. A small boy nicknamed little feller dead.  
This is a good book about a little known disaster.  A must read for someone from Chicago
