I guess most architects are familiar with the super famous modernists' projects, but few know what was put on the working drawings to realize it. This book does not provide actual construction drawings, but provide enough information to address what was quintessential aspects of the details. The reader would really appreciate the ingenuity of modern master's detailing by Ford's rich axonometric drawings of particular details. Ford painstakingly explains major issues involved in the details and weaves back to the historical basis of Modernism. Sometimes he makes bold generalizations to help a reader understand (and categorize) structural vs. envelope relationships. Throughout the book there is a clear categorization of attitudes towards the details; first, architects who would like to expose structure; second, architects who would like to wrap structure; third, architects who would combine the former two attitudes (expose/wrap structure). It was extremely rewarding to learn how Corb's details ("layered") differed from Mies's or Kahn's ("tectonic").  Four architects that I really enjoyed reading (because of my lack of knowledge on them) were; Asplund, Lewerentz, Greene Greene, and Aalto. I had to purchase these four architects' monographs after reading Ford's books.
