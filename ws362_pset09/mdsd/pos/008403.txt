This is no light read. If you like to read books that address topics like abortion, lesbian relationships, incest,and violence then this is the book for you. The characters are very well done. All of the characters are interesting and you can't help but care what happens to each of them. The graphic medical details I could have done without but like another reviewer said, this book will stay with you. It will also make you think
