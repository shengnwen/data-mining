Ahmad works in New Delhi and writes about India and Pakistan, their political cultures, and the Kashmir conflict. The &quot;Hindu Bomb&quot; may be more dangerous than the &quot;Muslim Bomb&quot; that one hears about in the West -- at least the Fascist/Fundamentalist politics of opportunistic hate that drives riots and massacres that could escalate into nuclear conflict. Read and learn before this becomes front page news. Understand the dangers of politicians enlisting nationalistic hate (as Milosovich did so effectively in Serbia). Ahmad treats the ideology and politics of the literate culture which is expressed more violently on the streets. The background of belicose India may be a surprise to those whose ideas come from the &quot;flower people&quot; days of looking to India for mystic gurus
