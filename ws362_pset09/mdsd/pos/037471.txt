This is a book for all people and all time.  
What is the nature of forgiveness?  How do we atone for the wrong that we do?  This is a primer on how one man did it. 
Please read this book and realize that our choices affect people's lives.  In this case, literally.  But, almost always figuratively.  The characters and the lines in this book have been with me for years.  This one and Ladder of the Years are Anne Tyler's best work.
