A well-plotted detective story with more than a hint of the thriller to it, it rises well above the run of the mill books of that genre, not simply in the excellence of execution (no pun intended) but through extraordinarily sensitive characterisation.  James draws a convincing and intoxicating picture of female nurses in a provincial hospital, we can smell the disinfectant, feel the strong wills, sexual repression and envy that abound but also the dedication and devotion.  Adam Dalgleish and his horny Sargeant explore this world in a way at once believable and shocking.  Very good stuff, much to be recommended
