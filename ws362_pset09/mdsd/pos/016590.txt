Tim Harrower's Inside Reporting is unlike any textbook I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them throughout my years and years of college.  

It looks weird on the shelf because it's an inch taller and an inch wider than most typical textbooks.  Open it up to any one of the first 186 pages and stunning graphics jump off the page.  Sections are small and fit nicely on one sheet.  It looks like a colorful newspaper.  The following hundred pages (aka, "The Morgue") look like the typical textbook--large blocks of text.  The Morgue is a section of reference articles and examples.  

Inside Reporting is well organized.  Each section is brief but packs a punch.  Look to the bottom of most pages and you'll find directions to other page numbers with more material or references to the Morgue.  Each chapter is also full of surveys, quotes from those in the industry, tests, and extra tidbits to help the budding journalist.   

I'm not yet and established journalists and I don't teach the subject.  In fact, I'm not even in a journalism class.  I picked up Inside Reporting because I wanted a good survey of journalism.  This grad student of a different study wants to learn more about journalism.  I wanted a book with meat but was fearful that an introductory book would be too fluffy and lack the information I needed.  This book was not the case. 

Inside Reporting is a fantastic textbook.  I couldn't have picked a better book, and I'm sure I'll be going back to it often as I move forward in the journalism arena.
