This is a review of the audio book on cassette, not the written book.  I learned, from this, that I really like audio books and I can listen to them at work.  You can't watch tv or read a book at work.  I am more lenient with this review than I would be if I had to read the book myself.  It is a luxury to have someone read it to me.

The reader is about what I'd expect.  He does a southern accent for almost all of the characters, an accent I find indistinguishable from one person to the next.  It's just Mr. Southerner.  At one point he does an English accent, or something, and after a few lines of that, I realized it wasn't Mr. Southerner.  So, in other words, you're lucky to get any accent at all.  When he speaks as a woman he just does his southern accent in a higher register.  Whatever.  If I was reading this book, I would leave the accents alone and just read in my own voice.  Better yet, I'd hire a few people to read for the different characters, and I'd hire people who normally speak that way and don't have to try putting on an accent.

The story itself is a bit odd.  The main character, Ray Atlee, discovers three million dollars in his father's house, and he discovers his father dead in the house.  From then on, he doesn't do anything that I would do.  His behavior is incomprehensible to me.

First of all, I would share my inheritance equally with my brother, no question.  I wouldn't keep it for myself.  That's ridiculous.  How the hell do you betray your own brother?

Second, I would immediately safeguard the money, before reporting anything to anybody.  As soon as I saw all that money, I'd load it into my car and take it home, and then I'd get it safely stowed in banks.  What he does with all that cash is asinine.

That being said, it is a pretty good story, and I thoroughly enjoyed it at work.  I give three stars for the story and one more star for the fact that someone read it to me
