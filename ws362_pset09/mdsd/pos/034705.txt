This book provides just about everything you would want to know about church sound systems. It may be a bit below a true Sound Engineer, but for the rest of us it is great. It doesn't cover all products but the general knowledge is there and for all but the pure novices it can be made to fit just about any product. It also makes a great reference book to keep on the shelf for thoses times things go wrong
