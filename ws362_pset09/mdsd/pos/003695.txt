Having read innumerable Dean Koontz books over many years, I became somewhat "Koontz'd" out about 5 years ago.  I was given both The Husband and Sole Survivor as gifts by my husband, who was unaware I had decided to (temporarily or permanently) take a break from the standard Koontz-world inhabitants - nice but troubled guy, great wife/girlfriend, cute kid & wonderful dog.  However, the old attraction held and I did read both books.  As for Sole Survivor, I must say I enjoyed this book alot more than I thought I would.  The protagonist, Joe Carpenter, has lost his wife and daughters in a horrific plane crash.  A year later, he is still not coping and is just basically bitterly existing his way through his isolated life.  At a one-year anniversary visit to the cemetery, he meets the mysterious Rose, and the story begins.  What follows is a definitely exciting chase-and-run story, with plenty of horrific events and revelations, and there are definitely some edge-of-the-seat situations.  As in alot of Koontz novels, the good guy is kind of bad, and the bad guys are REALLY bad.  Amazingly, all the action takes place in the space of a few short days.  Admittedly, the final explanation is somewhat far-fetched and stretching, but it does accomplish the purpose of tying everything together at the end.  The epilogue section is also a nice touch.  I'm not saying I will instantly buy every book the incredibly prolific Koontz puts out, but this book was definitely a nice return from my Koontz-hiatus
