I believe that this story brings you into a different setting that you might not be in at the time. When I first started to read the book, it became very uninteresting and I couldn't concentrate at all. But as soon as I got up to the part "All his life was lived in the sight and sound of Mattie Silver, and he could no longer conceive of its being otherwise," I knew that I was in for a story that would have me urging not to put the book down until I found out the denouement.
To tell you guys and gals the truth, when I got to the end of the book, I had mixed feeling about the book. I told myself that sometimes satisfaction that you want to attain, might end up being the suffering you deserve. Also, the second and last thing I thought, was that the life we have now, can be the life that we regret in the future
