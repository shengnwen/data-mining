Mr. Grisham's book  puts a very personal spin on the death penalty with the interesting twist of having a lawyer turn out to be the grandson of a the murderous racist convict. The book shows to literal evil of the codemned man. I was never persuaded to change my opinon of the death penalty. I agree with it. What this book convinced me that at some point a murderer can repent but that doesnt excuse that past crime. The portrayl of the condemned man in this book is brillant. This is an excellent books that flows smoothly and quickly
