My son and I love reading the 20th Century Children's Book Treasury.  We have read from it every night for the last two months straight, and are still going!  It is so much fun to discover new, unique stories. We would have never found many of these stories/books on our own. Some books come from different cultures. I have only heard of 6 or 7 out of 40 plus books included.  With 40 plus stories, the Treasury is a great value. The Treasury has the original book's pictures too, but not as many of them. 

The story variety is fun for kids and a relief to parents too.  We tend to read a story my son liked last time and then a new one or two.  Plus, we took only one book on our vacation.

Age wise, I think it would be appropriate for ages 3 to 6, maybe 7. Five Stars for sure
