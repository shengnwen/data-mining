The book offers a very broad and seemingly unrelated range of information.  You read, familiarize yourself with the theory of what is done in the field and afterwards it is very easy to apply the quite interesting information gotten from this book.  Inevitably, you would require some more practical (not necessarily detailed) information pertaining to more advanced projects.  In this case you will at least know what you are looking for and manage the time and project in a more professional manner
