I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It is well researched and provides a keen insight into the challenges facing the Western world today.The book goes a step further by providing specific, common sense steps for overcoming the enormous threat facing every American. A must read for those concerned about the growing threat of Jihad in todays world.
