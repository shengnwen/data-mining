While I haven't read many of Jonathan Kellerman's novels featuring Dr. Alex Delaware (a child psychologist who does consulting for the local police, and often ends up playing detective), this one is best.

The title, which I understand, after reading the book, might be a mistake, as it suggests themes that are not in the book.  The book starts with Dr. Delaware being asked to evaluate two little girls, whose father is incarcerated for killing their mother, as the father wants visitation with his daughters, while the deceased mother's family opposes the idea.  Then, he begins receiving very strange threats, including a tape of screaming and someone chanting about "bad love."  As Delaware, and his police-liaison and friend, Milo Sturgis, investigate, they begin to uncover connections between an increasing number of unsolved murders, with a seminar, years earlier, being the connecting thread.  And, the investigation indicates that Delaware is on the killer's hit-list.

The characters are well-rounded, the plot is complex, there are some genuine surprises, and, unlike Mr. Kellerman's "The Clinic," I did not feel that Delaware and Sturgis had suddenly come up with a few new, and crucial facts, right at the end, that enabled them to solve it.  Jonathan Kellerman does go too far, in my opinion, in describing everyone and everything, in great detail, thus slowing down the pace, but the story, in "Bad Love," overcomes this
