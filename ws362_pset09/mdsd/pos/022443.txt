Lonegren writes an excellent beginners guide to dowsing/divining step by step instructions and a free pendulum [of excellent quality] will help anybody get a good start at dowsing, after I finished the book I lent it out to a friend of mine and she loved it! I still use the original pendulum included in the book because I haven't found a better one. Anyone interested in dowsing should consider buying this book
