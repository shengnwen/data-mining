I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this book.  Fast paced, detailed characters, original story, and an epic feel make this a great read.  I haven't liked other Koontz before, but I guess Kevin J. Anderson helped pull Dean up to his level.  I look forward to the continuing story -- especially by veteran writer Ed Gorman
