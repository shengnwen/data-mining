"The Vagina Monologues" gave me a new appreciation for that mystical part of a woman's body, the vagina.  Although I think the monologues are too brief, they did cover some interesting subjects, everything from the first period to clitoral circumcision.  I think the book is valuable in examining the vagina and how it relates to how women feel about themselves.  But there are some shortcomings.  First, penis is only mentioned once throughout the entire book.  How can the male body part mean so little in a serious discussion of the vagina?  Surely, one can find women who have pleasant things to say about the male body sculpture.  Well, what do women think about the penis?  How does it feel during sex?  What does it look like to them?  These are all questions that went unexplored in the book.  While I applaud the book for turning our attention toward violence against women, there are surely good experiences to be expounded upon involving the opposite sex.  Are women that self-absorbed in their own little coochi snorchers not to embrace equality and have a frank discussion of the penis as well?  These matters of abuse, rape and incest will only begin to abate when there's some kind of equality among the sexes.  And it shouldn't be left to men to do, but should be advocated by women as well.  Overall, "The Vagina Monologues" is a step in the right direction, but it is only a beginning.  There are many more subjects to be raised, beyond lesbianism and selfish praise of one's own genitals, before equality can be reached.  And I hope that is the ultimate goal
