What exactly is the "it" in this story?  That's what the author leaves the reader to discover as you flip through the pages of this intriguing little book.  White pictures and font set against sky blue pages set up this childhood guessing game.  Sometimes it looked like spilt milk, but it wasn't spilt milk. Sometimes it looked like a birthday cake or a squirrel or a tree and so on and so forth. The book provides an excellent introduction for preschool/kindergarten lessons on clouds or as the pre-model activity for some other creative exercise.  Personally, I just like flipping through the book looking at the white on the blue, it's so calming and peaceful. Anyway, a very useful book to use teaching young children that they will enjoy having read to them
