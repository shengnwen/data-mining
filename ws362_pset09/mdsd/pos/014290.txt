Nick Cook dives headlong into the highly classified world of black technology; successfully shining a megawatt spotlight on this nearly invisible realm.  Cook jaunts from numerous American and European sites over the course of a decade (while maintaining his day job has an aerospace journalist), trying to pin down just who developed what technology when.  The Nazis were heavily invested in antigravity technology.  After the war, the Americans appear to have co-opted the technology (and the scientists) and have run with it ever since.

Cook not only delves into the "how" of antigravity...but also tries to answer a fundamental underlying question:  If the research into antigravity technology has been going on for more than 50 years...where is the evidence?  The evidence winds up in some unexpected places.  Dusty archives.  Abandoned mines.  The apartment of an eccentric genius in Vancouver.

All of Cook's research into the world of antigravity appears well documented and meticuously thought-out.  This being said, Cook makes some very startling claims, that, at times, I very much wanted to believe...and yet, I'd be lying if I said I believed all his claims verbatim.  However, this is not meant to belittle his investigation in any fashion and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of antigravity
