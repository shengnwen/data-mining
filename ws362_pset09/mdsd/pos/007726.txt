Ms Mitchell-Foust has given us a truely unique collection of poems with this book.  Wonders and freaks and people at odds with their surroundings being of particular interest to me - I find it truely wonderful that a poet as gifted and varied as Michelle has tackled this subject matter.  Often sympathetic but never sachirine these poems give us a rich and varied perspective on performers and oddities of all types.  The book itself is beautiful - the cover art and quotations adding texture to this already full plate
