I really enjoy these drawings! Simple but so touching!
It does to philosophy what high intellectual speculating cannot achieve: touch your hearth with the reality of everyday living. A treat every night before falling asleep! 
European drawings are certainly known the world over as masterly executed cartoons; but here, in Bill Watterson's series of Calvin and Hobbes, the American's sense of humour express itself by reaching the intellectual and the down to earth feeling! It brings back memories of childhood and fundamental questions adults rarely take the time to ponder, even for themselves! Five stars for this delectable reading!
