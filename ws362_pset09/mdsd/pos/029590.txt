You will not become rich, but may enrich your worklife with a Public  Sector postion. The authors objectively describe the percieved strengths  and weaknesses of public sector employment, both at the federal and local  level. The authors tend to slant their analysis heavily toward positions in  the U.S. Federal Government, rather than focus on local government  opportunities. The authors generally point out that bigger is better, even  in government employment. The highest paying positions with job advancement  potential will be found in the U.S. Federal Government, State, and larger  local governments. The book offers general advice and information how to  apply for government positions, but is not the primary focus of this book.  The authors also suggest that individuals should not necessarily consider  Government work as a life long career, unless one is willing to accept  lower pay at higher level positions. Thus, a competitive salary at higher  levels within government is less likely; one may plateau earlier in  government in terms of salary than in the private sector. A well balanced  book worth reading for anyone interested in this Government work
