As the Daughter of Sicilian Imigrants, I am naturally cautious of books that claim to be about a culture I know well and the land I think of as my second home.  This book is wonderful!  It has the rich history of Sicily  interspersed with Recipies that are as my own mother made them. The real  thing!  It is written with great fondness of the Island and of its people.   My father, of 88 enjoyed the book also.. saying that much of the history is  how he remembers it from tales told to him by my great and great great  grandparents.  My advise is .. If you love Sicily, the history culture and  food.. this book is a must have. It is a joyous work that Simeti has  crafted well! My thanks to her
