First off although my copy of the book has the copyright publication date at 1951, a blurb at the end states that Hesse wrote this in 1922.  That's incredible to think of considering the massive amounts of reprinting and influence of many aspects of this novel in the United States during the 1960's.  

It's a short novel, only 152 pages, and would be even less if published with the smaller font and spacing typical of most recent published paperbacks.  It's a novel of young man's attainment towards self-understanding and wisdom, via a myriad of events through life, including a humble life as a beggar, an affair with a manipulative wealthy woman, and even life as a rich man himself, and an eventual return to a humble life.

Many of the characters refer to themselves in the third person, so this may be confusing in the first few pages
