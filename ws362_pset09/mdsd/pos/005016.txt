Professor of Stats used Goodwin.  I thouroughly enjoyed his writing style.  Those who study psychology will hear of the notable psychologist, Boring,well Goodwin makes reading and studing psychology anything but  boring.  His writing style is refreshing, uncluttered, direct, informative  and intresting.  I have read just the first chapters in Goodwin's history  book. It too is just as readable as the stats book.  I am looking forward  to finishing this book.  It is written so a person not studing psychology  in school could read and understand it
