The book was recommended to me by a martial art expert. Found its methods easy enough to follow and quite efficient. The hard part is to follow a fixed schedule. The format (e.g font styles, sizes - for now it is quite monotonous) of the book needs to be improved. Recommended if you want to improve your kicks.
