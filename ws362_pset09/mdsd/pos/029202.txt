Along with the rest of the country, I watched the events of Hurricaine Katrina unfold and devastate New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  This well written book gave me the background, and the personalities involved in the dramatic events.  I passed the book on to my mother, a New Orleans native, who gave it an equally high rating.  I would have liked a few more pictures and maps, but that is a small quibble.  If you are interested in Hurricaine Katrina, buy this book
