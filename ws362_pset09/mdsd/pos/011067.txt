When Janie was walking back to class from lunch she decided to look on the back of the milk carton.  She saw her favorite dress, that she had owned as a little girl, on a young girl.  She thought instantly it could be her.  Soon she decided to find out more about this little girl and more about her history.  A little while later Janie found out it was her and decided to go find her real family any way she could, with her friends.
