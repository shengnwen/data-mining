One day, in sheep country, during the present Babe, the gallant pig, left with Mr. Hogget!                  Mr. Hogget won that pig by guessing his weight correctly.  When Babe and Mr. Hogget got to their farm Mrs. Hogget was starving to eat Babe for Christmas.  They were going to have him for ham, bacon, and black pudding.  Babe meets Fly, a collie bitch.  She teaches him how to become a sheep-pig.  Finally Babe proves his right not to be eaten by saving the sheep from rustlers.  The rustlers were trying to steal to sheep.  Babe saw them!  He started to scatter the sheep, so the rustlers couldn't steal the sheep.  The zoomed away.  Mr. Hogget heard about this.  He started to train Babe to become a sheep-dog.  Mr. Hogget entered him in to the Grand Sheep-Dog Trails.  "Will Babe win the Grand Sheep-Dog Trails, and become the best sheep-pig in the world," asked Fly?  I recommend Babe the Gallant Pig to all readers, because it is funny and suspensful
