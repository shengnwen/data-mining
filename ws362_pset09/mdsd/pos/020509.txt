I love the Todd Wilbur books, and this one is as good as the rest, with all new recipes.  If I'm really hungry for a KFC, I'll probably go to KFC, but it's also a lot of fun to make these recipes at home, especially if you're having a party.  I like the blueprints - they make it really easy to make the food
