I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jane Austen's Mansfield Park.  While it may start out a bit slow, after the first few chapters the rest of the novel is captivating.  It is hard to put down.  It is the story of an interesting love triangle that takes place in Britain during the early nineteenth century.  At this time in society, wealth, or the appearance of wealth, controlled people's lives.  If you were not of high social background, you tried to appear that you were.  This is the case of the main female character, Fanny.  After being sent by her mother to live with her wealthy uncle, Fanny learns the ways of sophisticated, well-learned people.  She becomes accustomed to their ways and is accepted, though not always treated equally.  She and her cousin, Edmund, become very close until separated by an attractive family that joins the Mansfield Park community.  As Fanny grows she becomes loved and even more beautiful.  She is soon the object of many men's affections.  However, Fanny is torn between living in the wealthy Mansfield Park and returning to her poor home in Portsmouth, which she thoroughly misses.  Where does Fanny choose to live?  Who does she choose as her husband?  You must read this great novel to find out.
