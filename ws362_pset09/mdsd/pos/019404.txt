I love these DeLorme maps.  I love traveling in the West but since I live in New Jersey, I get a little nervous sometimes when driving around Utah or Arizona - it's just so empty compared to what I'm used to.  These Delorme atlases are my security blanket.  They're so detailed that no matter where I am, I can look at the map and find a road or a landmark that will reassure me that I'm in the right place
