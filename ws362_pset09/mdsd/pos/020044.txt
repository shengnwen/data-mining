I read this book for the first time when I was 9 years old. It absolutely changed my life because it introduced me to the beauty of losing yourself in a novel, to disappear within the pages of a wonderful work of art is one of the most magical journeys anyone can experience. I thought that the best way to review this book is to post the original review I wrote about Anne of Green Gables when I was an enchanted 9-year-old girl.

"This was the best book I have ever read! It was sweet, sad, fun to read and funny! Anne is the most imaginative person I have ever met or read about. I think the author is very descriptive and I could picture everyone and everything in the book. I LOVED IT!!! (the original entry had hearts instead of period marks below the explanation point) My favorite part was when Anne smashed her slate over Gilbert's head, when she walked the ridgepole of the schoolhouse roof and when she dyed her hair green. That was the BEST! (once again heart adorned exclamation points)

I think that was certainly the best way to express my love for this book...straight from a child's heart
