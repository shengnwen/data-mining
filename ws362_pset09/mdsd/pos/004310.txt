As a student of History during my university days I inevitably came into contact with Janson's benchmark book. I certainly have not been alone in that regard. As with many books in my home library I seek out different editions of many titles. Trends, new revelations and often time re-examination of works come to fruition and result in a new edition being published. Art seems to have branched out into other forms of acceptable expressions and this edition has included those affinities when compared to my first lowly copy. This is a welcome trend indicating that ART is alive as one looks back and then turns toward the future.
