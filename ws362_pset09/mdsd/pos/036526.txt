A speaker may be able to wow an audience with technique and entertainment, but if everyone walks out the door unchanged, than the speaker is not a leader.  The speaker who truly engages an audience and makes them think about themselves, their roles, their company or their country is rare indeed.  To engage an audience on this level, you must have true conviction in what you say.  At the heart of leadership is the ability to tap your own values and experiences and communicate them to others.  Audiences today have grown much more cynical.  They can detect falsehood from the back of the hall.  Authenticity is the only thing that will reach them anymore.  Terry Pearce has the following advice for people who need to improve speaking skills, and communicate effectively as leaders.

	Discover what matters to you.  Uncover your values.  Make sure that you don't say anything in your speech that contradicts your core values.
	Create a structure for your speech with a beginning, middle and end. 
	Use data effectively.  Whenever possible, use specific information rather than talking generally.  Use examples.
	Use your personal experiences to connect with your audience.
