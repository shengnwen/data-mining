In San Francisco following two broken engagements and reaching her senior citizenship of being thirty, jewelry designer and heiress Morgan Malliard is upset as nothing passionate has ever happened to her; life seems to be passing her by at least that is how she feels.  She wants to taste "real life" without the use of her daddy's credit card.

Her best friends fellow Spa Del Mar "Spa Girls" fashion designer Lilly Jacobs and chiropractor Dr. Poppy Clayton bet Morgan that she cannot survive without a car, no credit cards, a pittance of money, and three pairs of shoes.  Except for the shoes Morgan assumes this will be a snap that until Morgan learns that someone consuming money may have to go to jail because Daddy is under IRS scrutiny for tax evasion; Morgan is perfect to take the fall as daddy has to earn money to pay for her lawyers.  Morgan insists she does not look good in prison striped jumpsuit, but the Feds do not care about her argument. 

Like the previous Spa Girl tale (see SHE'S ALL THAT) this is a superb inspirational chick lit tale because of the élan for life the three amigas show.  This time the plot centers on Morgan's woes and how she confronts them with the help of her Spa Girl buds by discovering the inner strength of her soul.  The courageous Morgan and her dad make terrible decisions that they must live with.
