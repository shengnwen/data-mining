I took an AP Chemistry class online, which meant a lot of self-studying. This was the second textbook I purchased for the class, after being unsatisfied by my first textbook. I did not have to buy another book after this one! The writing and explainations in the book are very clear, and I can think of very little that was left desired. 

It is true that a few things could have been explained more thoroughly, but as an introductory text it is understandable that some topics were just lightly covered.
