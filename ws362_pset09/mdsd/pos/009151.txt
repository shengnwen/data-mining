It definetely is not an ordinary biography. Alan gives a glimpse of his life and work but he is quite generous to share his feelings and emotions with us. I liked how he lets us take a peak into his emotional development and family life groving up. 

The book can be read in various levels. It can be a light read or it can be a moving read with about the same satisfaction. 

I would suggest it
