I doubt that you will find an inventor anywhere--even Edison--who has capitilized on all of his patents.  Bob Dematteis has.  I have read his book and have participated in his seminars.  His is the most down-to-earth and valuable advice I have ever read in the intellectual property field.  Rarely is one individual able to lead the way through the land-mine of steps it takes to turn an idea into a profitable venture.  Just in writing a patent application the use of the word "and" instead of "or" can be enough to disqualify a patent's value before it is even issued.
Bob is clear and consise and takes you every step of the way.  I have recommended his books to countless individuals and no one has ever been disappointed.
