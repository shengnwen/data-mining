Foop! is like what would have happened if Hunter S. Thompson decided to write a science fiction book. It's a really strange trip that's filled with great comedic moments. Read it for the journey and humor, and not necessarily the plot.

And do not be mistaken: this truly is cult fiction, not mainstream. Think Chuck Palahniuk and Augusten Burroughs because it has a similar "confessional memoir" tone). There's a touch of Douglas Adams in there, but this book has much more of an American feeling to be considered British satire. 

Kids in high school and young adults in college will absolutely eat this book up, as will others with a taste for the weird. It has cult classic written all over it
