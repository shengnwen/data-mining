We just love the cheerful and happy illustrations that make this a really meaningful Judith Viorst book. Here, the beautiful pictures' exuberant humor, joy, and color add another dimension, almost another story, to a tale of how different 2 sisters and a brother can be. They really do embody  &quot;the genuine spirit of animation, the breathing to life, the swing into action,&quot; that Maurice Sendak says he considers &quot;an essential quality  in pictures for children's books&quot; in &quot;Caldecott &amp; Co.,&quot; his book of essays on books and pictures. In fact, the pictures are so wonderful that you should look at the charming, wordless books Robin Preiss Glasser, the illustrator of &quot;Super-Completely,&quot; has made with her sister: &quot;You Can't Take a Balloon Into The Metropolitan Museum&quot; and &quot;You Can't Take a Balloon Into The National Gallery.&quot
