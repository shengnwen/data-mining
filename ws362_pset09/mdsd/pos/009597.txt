I always loved DIANA, AND ALL THE GOOD SHE DID,SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE DIED AND I THINK HAD THEY GOT HER TO THE HOSPITAL SHE MAY HAVE LIVED.I FEEL SHE WAS MURDERED.I READ WHERE SHE HADN'T SEEN HER BOYS FOR A MONTH, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE WERE ALLOWED TO VIEW HER AND TO SAY GOOD BY.   THANK YOU FOR SUCH A GREAT BOO
