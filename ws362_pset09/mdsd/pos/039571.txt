Mrs. Rigante and my husband's grandmother were aquaintances in her Brooklyn neighborhood; they lived just a few blocks from one another.  Grandma didn't write down a lot of her recipes, so Mrs. Rigante's cookbook is a lifesaver.  Their recipes are so similar it's like having a bit of home every time you open up the book.  We can't look through it without getting hungry!  Every recipe we've tried is excellent, and I love the family anecdotes and pictures.  This is a staple for every cookbook collection
