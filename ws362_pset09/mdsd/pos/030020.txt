A very good book about the passion of mountanering! By reading this book you achieve a very good undestanding of the passion for mountains and climbing. I bought this book in the sequence of having reed "In to Thin Air" from the same author and I was not disapointed after being delighted with the previous book.
Every mountanier should read it. Very good book
