I have personally read this book, and ( as a 13 year old), it has drasticly changed my life. There are passages in this book that told me things about myself I never knew. Like this &quot; I'f who I am, is what I have, and what I have is lost, who am I ?&quot; I no longer feal that money or impotance should matter in my life. I should live it accourding to my life, and not by the will of others
