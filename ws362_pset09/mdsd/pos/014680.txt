 Marc McCutcheon is one heck of a coach. I'm not a writer, at least not a writer of anything beyond educational materials for lawyers and judges. I picked this book up out of idle curiousity.

  Now, thanks to Mr. McCutcheon, my head is popping with ideas for non-fiction books based on what I know and do for a living.

  McCutcheon covers what turns out to be the forehead-slapping obvious: why didn't I think and then write that. He lays out the possibilities of non-fiction writing as a way to fame, fortune, fulfillment or some combination of the above.

  His writing style is down to earth and really quite appealing. he makes it all sound so possible.

  He walks through the entire process from market research to query letter to proposal to sitting done and getting it done.

  I have to admit, McCutcheon is quite the salesman which is a good thing when you consider what he is selling is your own potential. Highly recommended even if you have no intention of writing non-fiction books. This guy is worth a read.
