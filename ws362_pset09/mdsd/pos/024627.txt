This book has one thing going for it right from the get go: dinosaurs!  You know its going to be action packed right there.

Now you are probably saying I already saw the movie why would I want to read the book.  Well I am not going to spoil the suspence for you but the book is very different then the movie.  Some people who get killed in the book do not get killed in the movie and some people who survive in the movie do not survive in the book.

Mr. Crichten you kept me guessing until the very end and even then I usually guessed WRONG!  Except that I guessed there were going to be dinosaurs from the cover and also I had seen the movie.

Anyway great job!

I give this book FIVE STARS because it is just that good
