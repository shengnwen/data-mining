There have been a few attacks on this book, which seems weird.  This book was written for video editors and motion graphic artists by an editor.  It just addresses how to use Photoshop as a broadcast tool and how to do so quickly.  The book has a wealth of content, a DVD with lots of great stuff including training videos.  It's a solid book that has helped many people.  Be sure to read several reviews when making up your mind
