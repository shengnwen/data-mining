I've read a few RC's now, and while so far they've all been pretty good reads, I want mention that this one is outstanding. His stories are about normal, intelligent (is intelligence that normal these days?) people who are thrown into a web of intrigue and danger. This one stands out because of the suspenseful climax of the novel that is extended over the last 80 or so pages. Really well done.
