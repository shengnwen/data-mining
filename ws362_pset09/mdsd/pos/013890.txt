I think Walk across America Was a grab you by the Brain and pull you in. The way he wrote the book you were there walking with him.I read this book 10 years ago and still tell people about it.
The people he meets on the way are true Americans. The one part I will never forget is the part about Church. This is something else. I could not put this book down. I think everyone would love this book. It has a little of all of us in it
