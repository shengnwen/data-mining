I think the book was very nice to read, even though some parts of it were a bit difficult. It had a good story and some good feelings which you can also see around you. Like people being selfish to hide their lack of self-confidence.
I liked the part when Frankie ran away from home. She finally realizes that she can't make it by herself and wants someone to go with her. This is the part where her loneliness is showed, anyway she doesn't want to be alone. So that's why she's doubting so much. 
I learned about people's feelings who have such a complex like Frankie. They feel lonely and inferior to others but try too change their character into the opposite, so like they aren't alone and are very cool and all. But actually they're hiding their real "I".
