WOW.... thank you Mike Mason!  My fiance and I are reading this book together during our long-distance engagement and find that the insights are thoroughly enriching to our relationship.  This book deals with the spiritual picture of marriage, absolutely no practical &quot;do's and don'ts&quot; here.  There are no &quot;how to's&quot; or guidelines for having a successful marriage... and honestly, such information seems so surface compared to the richness and wealth offered by this book.  Understanding and applying the truths presented here almost guarantees a joyful and harmonious marriage.  the mystery of marriage unveils the bedrock of marriage and then causes it to glow!  I look forward to reading this book out loud with my wonderful husband in the many delightful years to come.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
