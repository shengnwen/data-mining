I'm only a casual fan of Peanuts but I saw these boxed sets and bought the first one quite cheaply to "test the water" as we Brits say... Fabulous. I've since bought this 55-58 set and will be buying the others. Can't recommend enough, although the lack of colour where there was colour before (the Sundays?) is a little disappointing now I know about it - not enough to put me off. The design of these books can't be bettered I don't think - Seth has done an AMAZING job in capturing the feel of the period and the cartoons within
