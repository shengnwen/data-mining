Overall impression (visual): This book is stunning! At $35 MSRP (but greatly discounted thru Amazon; and you probably won't find it cheaper even on ebay) it seems a bit expensive for a hardback 220-page, glossy-cover book, but the effort and detail in the design is immediately apparent, making this a visually stunning work. The binding is tight and the paper acid-free (so it won't curl, fade, discolor or inexplicable 'thin' over time). The artwork is fabulous, with no real duds throughout the book, and the page design is detailed, and consistent to the end. Unlike the old 1st and 2nd edition books, which were ratherly poorly made, with next to no interior artistic design (mostly white pages with b&w illustrations), and mediocre writing, the 3rd edition works are often coffee-table quality. Lords of Madness is definitely worthy of a spot beside Great Bridges of America or Martha Stewart's Holiday Best (ha ha)! 
(Content): Lovecraft meets D&D! If you like Lovecraft, or at least the Lovecraft/Smith mythos, you'll find lots to love about LOM. The book is set up as a kind of sociology text of several abberative races, with Lovecraftian-sounding names and storylines. Here you'll get some interesting history, backstory, even cross-sections of creature physiology; and great for DMs, adventure jumpstarts for each race. The writing is great! Definitely a book for the personal library; LOM can be enjoyed by actual players and readers alike (and I recently read a survey that found more people purchase and read the D&D supplements than actually play D&D...interesting, but if true, this book will satisfy that group!)
