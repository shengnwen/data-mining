I was originally introduced to this book because I was told to read "caring for your introvert", which is a hiliariously bitter essay by a self-professed introvert.  I then read the rest of the book, and was overall very impressed.
As is in all of science and nature study, there are some essays that are a bit controversial (the book starts out with "genesis of suicide terrorism", to give you an example).  There are some essays that will appeal to a lot of people ("Sex Week at Yale", "Bugs in the Brain") while others will only appeal to a certain subset of the population ("Ask the Bird Folks" if you are really into birds, "through the eyes of a octopus" if you are into that sort of thing").  Perhaps the wide spectrum of essay selection is both its strength and weakness.  Overall, a highly readable book and a contribution to scientific dialogue.
