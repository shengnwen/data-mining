Having worked in several different sectors before arriving in fashion, I can say that there are lawyers, CEOs, doctors, etc. who are as equally psycho as Anna Wintour. But not too many people would want to read about a neurotic Hospital Director! It seems that some people who bought this book aren't even interested in fashion and have no real perspective on Vogue magazine. If you aren't fascinated by the subject matter, why buy the book? I have read every US Vogue since 1982, have lived in many European countries and am extremely familiar with other Vogues around the world and work in fashion, so I can say with full conviction that Anna Wintour is very important in her field. Fashion is a business like any other and it comes down to money. She turned UK Vogue around then came to NY and turned US Vogue around. I agree that she is pretty psychotic, but in general, you're kidding yourself if your think market leaders can be "normal". Who cares if she is a good writer or not? She DOESN'T write! She is a fashion editor and her magazine is THE most influential and financially successful in the world. Every other fashion magazine in the world is based upon what shows up in US Vogue whether we like it or not. And she does know how to pick interesting writers for her own publication! Do you think most CEOs can type their own letters or do market research? No, they are there to lead and make decisions. I love hearing the gossip on her, so this book was fun to read, but I do respect her immensely from a professional point of view. Appreciate the book for what it is - don't act like your profession (or colleagues) are more respectable or holy than the those of the fashion industry. And by the way, dressing well is part of the job in fashion. Would you expect a IT professional to not use a computer???!
