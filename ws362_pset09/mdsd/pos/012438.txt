This book is chock full of great ideas to spend more "quality time" with your preschoolers.  The ideas range from the basics (like creating a Froot-Loops necklace) to the more exotic.  Most are easily accomplished and require only household items.  A lot of them will help educate your child without their knowledge! Nearly all of the ideas are things you might have done at one time or another when you were a kid, but probably had forgotten.  Also, I love the appedix which includes recipes for edible and inedible play-doh, face paints, glues and pastes, pasta dye, etc.  If you are ready to take on the challenge of a preschooler, this book will help you do it in style
