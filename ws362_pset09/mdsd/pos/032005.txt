I have not been the same since I read this book.  Lauren takes a lot of metaphysical teachings and puts them all together in one easy to read book, with practical applications.  It's just amazing!  I think that anyone who reads this book, and is serious about loving life and living life to it's fullest will find this &quot;THE ONE&quot; to get them on their way.  Once you are on your way, if you falter, you can always go back through the book and re-apply it to new situations that come up.  It will never be outdated
