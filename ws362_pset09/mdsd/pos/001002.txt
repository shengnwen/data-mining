Having lived in the author's home for two years while in New York I am biased towards this niche masterpiece.  Although my interests are on opposite sides of the map in relation to this book I had the privilege to witness, first hand, the author's diligence and perseverence in putting the finishing touches on his textual opus.  

In this book Mr. Gauch brings his statistical mastery with him in his endeavor to reconcile science, philosophy and religion in the public arena.  In so doing he greatly enables scientists to become better at what they do by examining the foundations of the scientific method.  This book is a must read for students of science and scientific professionals alike
