All I can say is that this is a great book. I am a 48 year old junior high art teacher, wife &amp; mom.  Reading it gave me a much needed boost. Using our creativity is lifesaving. Mari Messer's book is easy to read &amp; fun.  The book itself is beautiful.  I know you aren't suppose to judge a book by it's cover, but I do sometimes.  This is a beautiful book - inside &amp; out. Don't you just love the title?  Read it and recommend it to friends
