In 1954 I was stationed with the U.S. Navy in the Washington, D.C. area. While I was on duty one rainy evening in August, a captain in the Medical Corp. was billeted in the brig awaiting trial on charges of having sexual relations with an enlisted man. This medical doctor had been in the Navy for most of his adult life. He knew the consequences if he was caught in a homosexual act. Instead of waiting for the trial, the dignified doctor lay down on his narrow cot, poured lighter fluid over himself and lit a match. When I saw his charred body, brig personnel had carried his remains to the sidewalk where a damp summer wind carried the stench over the whole Naval complex. As I stood over the charred bones, I wondered what caused a man to commit an act that would cause him if caught to take his own life. Also, I made a vow that evening that if I could do anything to change public opinion that caused this decorated captain to take his life. I would.
      Patricia Nell Warren, authoress of the Fancy Dancer, has given me a keen insight into a young priest who risked being defrocked because of his touching love for a degenerate young man. This story appalled me at times, but yet I thank a writer who tells a touching story, in a manner that made it impossible to put the novel down before I read the last word. Patricia, thank you for giving me an understanding insight into the Gay lifestyle. Luther Butl
