I love Sally's Knit (book 1) and Purl (book 2), so it seemed only right to buy this one too!  It is a beautiful books with great illustrations and patterns, but dare I say a little advanced for this newbie knitter, so for now, it sits on my bookshelf until I feel competent enough to tackle one of the many projects.
