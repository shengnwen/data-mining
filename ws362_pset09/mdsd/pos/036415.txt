This is an extremely practical book.What I really like about it is all the photos. As a beginning quilter, I find it very useful to see the technique illustrated with a photo. With tips on all kinds of patchwork techniques, this book is an ideal second quilting book (with the first book being a more comprehensive book on the entire quilting process, like Fons and Porter's Quilter's Complete Guide). I really like the sections on problem solving in each chapter. I think this book would be useful for intermediate quilters as well (I assume it's too basic for really advanced quilters)
