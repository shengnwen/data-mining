  This book is a real HOOT!

  I guess the thing that makes Larson's cartoons so different is that his mind is just a little further off in space than where most of ours dwell.
  Reading a whole book of these cartoons is a very different thing from looking at individual cartoons over an extended period.After 10-15 pages your mind tends to get climatized to this thought process and his cartoons almost start to feel like the normal ,rather than perverse, way to look at things.
  We all need this exercise in mind-stretching and it is great to do it with humor.
  I strongly recommend it to anyone who is not already a fan of Larso;myself for instance,at least until now.
  If there are a few cartoons in the book that you did not "get";it simply means your mind is not totally warped yet.Just keep at it,you'll make it!
  Enjoy
