Scot knocks a home run over the fence with this book. This book somehow manages to touch on virtually all the hot topics in Office SharePoint Server 2007 in a mere 500 pages. It is an easy read with fantastic samples. This book should be on every developer's desk if anything for the 30-some pages in chapter two that walks you though setting up MOSS 2007 development environment using MSFT's Virtual Server. I'm recommending this book to all my customers
