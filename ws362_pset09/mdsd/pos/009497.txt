it's too long.

I rarely like books that are this long (nearly 1,300 pages) and it's because I just don't think most books need to be this long.  When you write a book that is this long, it's usually bloated with material, and there is so much text that it's nearly impossible to get through.  With 34 (yes THIRTY-FOUR) chapters, this book is just way way overkill.  I don't want to give the wrong impression though, as this book has good content and is an excellent resource for ASP.NET 2.0 developers.  If you don't mind crazy large books, then this text might be perfect for you.  As it is, I have no qualms recommending this book, I just think if a couple hundred pages were trimmed off, this could have achieved the same goals and been a tighter end result.

**** RECOMMENDE
