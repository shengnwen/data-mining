The picture of a man in his youth (Dorian Gray) becomes his worst nightmare. While years pass by, the portrait starts to reflect the man's sins and wrinkles while he remains as young as it was at that moment. He becomes a person driven by pleasure and he decides to experience everything he can, whether it's good or evil. Until one day, he cannot stand it anymore..
