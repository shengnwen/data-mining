Miriam Cameron shares her journey to inner peace through various paradigms--both religious and secular.  And as she comes closer to her center, she prepares for a trip to seek the perspectives of the Tibetan people.  Fortunately, Ms.Cameron takes the reader with her and her spouse, Mike, on breath taking (literally) mountain bus rides to the center of Tibet.  The reader listens in as they speak to Tibetan monks and nuns who fear the demise of their culture.  However,the Tibetan people whose lives are committed to positiveness and compassion transcend the Chinese desecration and provide direct guidance for all who encounter these beautiful people. Reflective of their peace, along with Miriam, I was touched in a very personal and profound way
