Dr. Cohen's exceptional book sets the record straight on the positive potential of life's second half. He uses current research to demonstrate why older adults should view later life as a time of personal growth and enrichment. He further deomonstrates that what he labels developmental intelligence involves more than just countering the disengagemetn theory of aging but involves "deepening wisdom, judgement, perspective, and vision." This book openly counters aging stereotypes while encouraging people to embrace the potential of life's second half. A must read for everyone age 50 and over and anyone interested in better serving what is quickly becoming the new consumer majority
