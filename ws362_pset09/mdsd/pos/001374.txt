Great book for both beginners and those already involved in "Gentealogy". The book explains it all, what it is all about, how to get started and where to get started. Some of the material starts to get pretty involved but Megan Smolenyak and Ann Turner have tried to keep the book at a layperson level and succeeded. This fast moving field of Genealogy is the latest trend and ever changing.  The authors do emphasis this fact with constant reminders to keep looking for new updates in this ever field.  A bargain price and a great reference book. DNA is the way of the future inside and outside of Genealogy, get the book and read it to understand some of what is going on in the ever-changing technology
