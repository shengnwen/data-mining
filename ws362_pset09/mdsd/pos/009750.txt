A friend asked me to read this book for my opinion.  It's not anything I need to meet women, I'm good at that already.  It does have very good advice and useful tips for guys who struggle with women, though.  It's dull as my old boyscout knife, though, too.  I've been going thru books in the pickup genre.  The only two you need are this one and GOD IS A WOMAN: DATING DISASTERS.  I have a listmania that adds another book which I'm too embarrassed to admit I even read here, but it is good for when you are in a serious relationship and struggle relating to your woman
