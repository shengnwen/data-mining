A number of reviewers have pointed out that the information presented in this book is not new. This is certainly true. However, the author poses a juxtaposition of the information which does create something new and interesting. Should this volume comprise the sole text in your library on the history of the Revolution? Of course not. It does provide useful reminders to look beyond the obvious. The 'glorious cause' was not glorius for all. The ideals of the Revolution were not all realized with the Declaration nor with the Treaty of Paris nor with the ratification of the Constitution. Those ideals do still drive us today to get it right; to make it better; to fix it where we got it wrong. This is a very enjoyable read which should cause you to think a bit about issues which typically receive rather light attention in other histories
