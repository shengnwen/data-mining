While much work has gone on in the philosophy of science (progressive and otherwise) since Popper wrote his magnum opus, this work still stands as a survey of central issues in the philosophy of science. It analyzes concepts central to science itself (e.g. probability) and attempts to characterize science itself. That the latter analysis is incomplete is well known by now. This does not detract much from the book's well deserved reputation - but does result in this book having a 4 star review from this reviewer. It should be noted that Popper's criterion is ultimately a sort of &quot;negative rationalism&quot; - and from there it is not far to irrationalisms. Be warned. Works of Bunge, Kitcher and Laudan (for example) attempt to deal with this latter problem. The student or curious individual studying this work for current (rather than historical) interest is well advised to keep these later works in mind, as well as the later works of Popper himself
