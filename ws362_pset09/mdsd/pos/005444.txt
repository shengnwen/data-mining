This book is SciFi not fantasy.  The only thing in common with the movie and TV series are the animals.  This is much better than they are as it is the original.  Even the Beast Masters name is different in the book.  In the book his name is Hosteen Storm, a retired soldier and his animals are genetically modified with increased intellegence and empathy so they can bond with him.  While trying to avenge the death of his mother he discovers an ancient alien city and finds out that Earths enemies are still around
