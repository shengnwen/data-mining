This is the best book ever written. Period. Seriously this book changed my life on many levels. James is the perfect little boy ever I wish he were my son-no scratch that I wish he was my husband. No but really this book made peaches my favorite food ever. Everyone should read it. It should be mandatory reading for citizenship into America, to obtain a highschool diploma, and to go to the bathroom.  Okay go read....then eat a peach. James and the Giant Peach is the besst book ever, it gave me morals. It solidified my views on the intersection of race, slavery, freedom, and talking centipedes. This book taught me right from wrong. This guy in the computer lab with me does not like this book I question his intelligence. He threw a frisbee paper plate at me, if he had read James and the Giant Peach he would know violence is not the anwser. that is all. go rea
