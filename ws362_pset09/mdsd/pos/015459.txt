I am certain this review will be redundant, but I am leaving it in the hopes that anyone who hasn't yet been convinced picks up Lonesome Dove.  Quite simply the best work of American fiction I have read.  My friend had been telling me for years to read Lonesome Dove, but I was never a fan of westerns, and I just didn't see how I would like it.  Once I started, like so many others, I couldn't put it down, and was sad to see it end.

The characters will become your friends by the book's end, and you will feel like you were right there for the journey.  Just plain great.  The last time I enjoyed a book this much was when I was a kid and read Watership Down, which I also had no interest in reading until my sister talked me into it.  I'm glad in both cases I took the advice
