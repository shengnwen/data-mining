This was a wise purchase made after several books were reviewed from the library. We wanted to have a resource handy and this made sense since it covers the first five years and not just one. We like that it is objective and not full of opinions like some books. Sometimes things are hard to find in a pinch (hence only 4 stars) but overall there is a great deal of useful information and the book is organized well. I'd have given 4.5 stars if I could
