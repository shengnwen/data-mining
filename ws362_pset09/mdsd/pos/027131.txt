What a fun romp this Pinkwater book is!  The book starts out on a gloomy note, with the young protagonist, Ivan, resenting his parents' move to urban Hoboken.  Soon he finds 2 new best friends who assist him in sleuthing down a decades-old mystery.  The character sketches are rich, but the book is fast-paced and an easy read.  This would be a great read-aloud in a 2nd or 3rd grade classroom or a wonderful read-alone for 4th grade and up.  Looking for Bobowicz might also be used to inspire older grades in writing local lore adventures.  Librarians will especially enjoy the characterization of Starr Lackawanna, the librarian who helps the children solve the giant chicken phantom mystery.
