Book number two picks right up and runs with it... there's not a huge amount of boring backstory to catch up those who haven't read the first one, which I liked. The story was fast paced, with a lot more action/adventure in it than the first in the series. I read through it quickly. I must say one thing about the entire Left Behind series is that they are "easy reads" in that you don't have to labor over every word, simple English but not boring. I really enjoyed the second book in the series, almost as much as the first one. (read all my reviews of all the books for a full picture)
