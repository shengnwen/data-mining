Many times in the last month I've recommended an old stand-by book by marriage counsellor and psychotherapist David Schnarch.  Why?  Because it has some very important concepts about how things work.  Not just quick fixes, to-do's, tips, and techniques, but real information that can lead couples to a new way of thinking, and therefore approaching, their committed relationships and sex lives.

I'll be the first to admit that Passionate Marriage: Love, Sex, and Intimacy in Emotionally Committed Relationships is not the most well written book. The first quarter of it is repetitive but the concepts are necessary to understand in order to fully realize the rest of its rich, valuable content.  Bear with it; it gets better.  It combines marital therapy and sex therapy (finally!) and recognizes how the two are linked and must be dealt with.  Based on Schnarch's first book, The Sexual Crucible, (not recommended - too dry) it is essentially for those self-actualized individuals, often more mature couples, who are willing to commit to working through the process of facing themselves first.  It understands and discusses how men and women differ in prioritizing their relationship (men tend to let the relationship suffer to hold on to their sense of self; women let their sense of self suffer to hold on to the relationship).  It also explains why compromise is not always possible and why it's often not the best option.

Committed relationships can be a wonderful arena for personal growth and one's capacity for sexual fulfillment and intimacy grows as one ages.  Passionate Marriage talks about the process of marriage with insights that should have a positive affect on all one's relationships, both intimate and casual.  

Written in 1998, with over a half a million copies sold, it was followed up in 2003 by the audio CD, Secrets of a Passionate Marriage (unabridged)
