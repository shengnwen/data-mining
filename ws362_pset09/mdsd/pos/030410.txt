Rage Of Angels - thats not a phrase you hear everyday, thats not a quote that when you hear it, you get an instant picture of waht that means, when you read this book, your mind is stumped, you fall over the words of the book and can't pull yourself away.  The very beginning of the book doesnt go on and on until you finally get into the book where there's something actually going on, when you start reading, your instantly attached to every word, no boring and tag along space.  The way Sidney Sheldon goes into the detail of every thought of the characters in "Rage Of Angels" is wonderful, it allows you to be able to capture every thought and feeling.  If you like anything to do with the Mafia, New York, and Detail, you'll love this book.
