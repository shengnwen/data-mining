Requiem for a Dream is quite literally one of the strongest pieces of American literature written in the 20th century. Selby's previous work showed us his uncanny ability to use sounds found in the underground scene of America and seemingly and stunningly make them art. The novel is about many things, but mostly it's about compassion: the ability to see people who were once unlovable become lovable, and by extension, humanize the reader. The novel ultimately reveals what it means to be human.

The story is absolutely incredible from beginning to end. The characters are believable and emotionally battered. And most importantly, the story is simple in its core, yet it's very heavy. 

I suggest reading the book even if you have watched the excellent film adaption done by Aronofsky. The book covers many more elements, which further humanize the reader.

If you haven't checked this novel out, do so. You won't forget it
