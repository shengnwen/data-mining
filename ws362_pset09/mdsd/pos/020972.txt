This is such an impressive little book. The peacebuilding field can be complicated and loaded with jargon. This sometimes makes talking about peace issues seem limited to those who have academic understanding of the social sciences. What Schirch has managed to do is take some very complex concepts and make them easy to understand. This is an eminently readable book and would commend it to anyone serious about making this a more peaceful and secure world.
