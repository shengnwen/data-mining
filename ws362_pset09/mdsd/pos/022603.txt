I am a Music Teacher at Montessori preschool. My class includes children ages 2 1/2 to 6 years. This story and music are perfect for the whole class. Boys especially will enjoy this story, however, girls will really like it too. The music is good quality, that is what I search for in a story-music lesson. The book is beautifully illustrated and well written. I have purchased other Scholastic Sing and Read Storybooks and they are great also.
I will read the book to the class; then we will listen to the musical story and sing along with the CD. All of the students will love to participate in this musical lesson.
