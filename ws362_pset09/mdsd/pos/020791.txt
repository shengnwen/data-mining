The jury of a big tobacco civil trial is being manipulated from all sides. The defense has hired Rankin Fitch, an expert at fixing juries. He and his minions know everything there is to know about the jurors especially their weaknesses. There is one juror, Nicholas Easter, however, that is a mystery to them. His background is sketchy and they can't pinpoint how to approach him. Then Fitch starts getting cryptic phone calls from a young woman and discovers Easter is quietly controlling the jury from the inside. Fitch knows the endgame will be a large amount of money for the verdict he wants, but the question is, how much?

Grisham does a masterful job at weaving this story and controlling the many characters without confusing the reader. The pace is fast and it keeps you wondering what exactly do Easter and the woman want? The only complaint I have is a few too many subplots that took away from the focus of the story. Overall, a great read
