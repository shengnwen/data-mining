I really didn't care for this book at first, but had to purchase it for a class. As I read the book, it began to grow on me and I found it to be a great resource book, one that you may want to keep in your personal library for future questions about organizational development. This book gives great options on how to get people to work together, how to endure the resistance of people during change, as well as how to make the most of the a sucessful organizational change. I wish I had this book when I was president of my organization and had trouble getting larger groups of people, all with various strong opinions, to work together. This book gives it to you straight, a definite source of relief when dealing with or preparing for chaos in an organization
