This question will keep you reading this book to the very end.  You know it's not going to be tidy, but don't despair: there is a resolution of sorts.  I'm not going to spoil that for you if you haven't yet read the book.  And anyway my own reading of the ending of the novel is still tentative.  Others have commented that the story is like a dream, but I disagree.  There is a dream -like quality, but events are not random, not even surrealistic.  Ishiguro details events with precision and with absolute clarity.  You'll find time slippage and acceleration, curved space-time, and omniscient first person narration. The narrator, a professional concert pianist (possibly) named Ryder, almost seems to leave his body and follow the thoughts and events of other characters at times.  

Here's what I think is going on.  When the narrative focuses on Ryder, he is self-assured and coherent in his thinking, but the ordinary events, places, characters and scenes of the city he is visiting always seem off-kilter.  Is it something about Ryder or something about the city and its characters?  The book asks this question: what kind of a reality do we inhabit and what are the social and internal processes we use to keep ourselves sane?  That's the line of enquiry this book will take you on. 

One last bit of advice.  The book is hilarious by turns, providing a great deal of biting social satire.  Just don't let the narrative twist you into too many knots so that you can't enjoy the many comic aspects of the novel.

The structure of the narrative is unique.  I've never read anything like it.  Events proceed in a very linear fashion, but with little context or overall structure.  The closest book to this that I can think of would be The Master and Margarita, also a great novel
