I was never sucked into Amway itself,but i did do network marketing for a short period of time.I lost a great deal of money,and suffered in emotional terms as well.Steve Butterfield's book on Amway from the mid80s still rings true after all these years.Some of the emphasis would have to be different today,since we have already seen the rise of the Internet and suffered the catastrophic burst of the tech bubble.Butterfield hits all of the major points,and he does it well.Anyone with any self-respect is going to suffer many indignities in the world of MLM : the endless,stupid meetings;the endless conversations with uplines,the lies,the deceptions,the rosy scenarios whcih never work out like they supposed to; the lost income,and the throwing of good money in after bad.Butterfield discusses the difficulty of prospecting friends and relatives,the frustration and expense caused by no-shows,and utter dependence that a new distributor has on his direct upline pin.Butterfield also discuss the endless pressure to buy worthless,unprofessional motivational and sales tapes.To be fair,many other MLMs have limited their number of meetings and many of the newer ones drop-ship directly to customers and allow all distributors to deals directly with home office.However,the basic truth of MLM is that the success of the few depends upon the fails of the many.That has not changed.MLM means "more lost money", and one should be careful before jumping on this income reducing merry-go-round
