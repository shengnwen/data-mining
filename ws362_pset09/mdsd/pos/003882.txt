I am a Personal Trainer N.A.S.M.- CPT with a MS in Exercise Science and a former Div I Athlete (Volleyball).  I collect many methods of training for my clients.  This book is great to provide yet another method of training that emphasizes core and hip strength.  Easy enough for the general client to follow and yet interesting and inspiring to me
