The best aspect of this text may be the very thing that some do not care for--it has some interesting trivia about manuscript preservation as well as culture and lifestyles in ancient times. I read it twice--once in a skimming fashion, which was just fine. The second time, days later, I read the parts I skipped the first time and enjoyed most of that too. 

As other reviewers have noted, this is not the so-called gospel itself, but rather a story about its travels over time. I do not view the recovered manuscript about Judas as part of the divinely inspired scriptures, but enjoyed this book for the interesting insights about other issues, which CAN be verified.
