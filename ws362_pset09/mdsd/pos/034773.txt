This is my first Danielle Steel book, and it won't be my last. I have read so many good things about the way Danielle Steel writes I don't know why I never got around to reading her books, a friend of mine and I are reading the same books and we came across this book. I just like the way these two people were able to find love for the second time around. With Peter losing his wife and rasing his kids, With Mel having to rasie her twins girls by herself when the twins father ran out on her, to find someone in a different state and to hold on the love that they have and figture out where to go from there it's like your are taking a ride along with them to find the journey that they hope to find together as a family, and what a journey it is
