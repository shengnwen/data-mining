Everyone should read this book.  It was written at the begining of the 19th century, but everything is still important today.  I ordered this book for a friend in prison and he loved it, and passed it around to other prisoners.  If you know anyone in jail or prison, please send them this book.  It was my husband's favorite book before he was killed on a freight train.  It's very well written and comes highly recommended
