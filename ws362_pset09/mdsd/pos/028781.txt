Reading "Angry Black White Boy" really gave me hope that people in our society may be able to start, on a broader level, an ongoing dialog about what "whiteness" is and how the issues surrounding whiteness make them feel.
Even though the novel is flawed(I felt the ending was rushed...or was it just the flurry of my own mixed feelings about what happens?), I thought most of the characters were either dead-on portrayals that I recognized bits and pieces of from people I have known, or the ridiculous charicatures the auther obviously intended them to be.
Just for having the balls to write this book, I give Mansbach a five star review
