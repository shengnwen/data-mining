Many reviews before me have said "communism is evil." But in my opinion, Communism isn't evil, the rules who distort communism are evil. If a person were to read Karl Marx before simply commenting they would probably have a different opinion.

I reccomend The Communist Manifesto to anyone interested in political theory, This book changed my view of communism in a big way, I no longer see it as evil or oppressive but as an alternative to big business and false democracy. Anyone who says Karl Marx's theories are evil, must like to be oppressed by the wealthy
