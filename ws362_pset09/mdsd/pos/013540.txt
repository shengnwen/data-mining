i'm not a big reviewer but think its time to put in some effort. I have her Book and i also have the Essential Mat DVD, Alycea's Portable Pilates and also On the Ball with Lizbeth garcia.

Brooke's books is the definite essential as everyone says but her Body Kit is fantastic here's why :

The 2 DVDs are akin to doing it in a studio environment, no pausing, no silly stops in between 
Her flashcards are informative and whilst they explain the basics have enough depth for intermediate users. simple things like visualizations, little arrows is what distinguishes a great pilates dvd from good. Pilates is so subtle, sometimes its so hard to get it right esp on your own at home.

I think the least useful DVD for me was the Essential Series - i think its great for teachers and people who have been doing pilates for yrs and more as a historical, ref book, its not so useful for those who just want a weekly, daily workout.

My only problem is a lack of discipline on my part. 

I hope this helps in your buying decision
