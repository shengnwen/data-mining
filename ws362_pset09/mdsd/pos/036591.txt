I listened to some interviews with Iain Murray on ninemarks.com.  In one interview, he discussed this book and I was extremely intrigued.  I am 100% on the side of ecumenism with Murray and Dr. Lloyd-Jones. This book is good to let you know the historical aspect of Evangelicalism.  Murray didn't really attempt to apply in a typical manner.  But it is extremely applicable if you see how others have gone wrong.  I think we should read this, and others like it, with a sense of humility.  We need to weigh tough topics like this with God's infallible Word and nothing else.  I believe Murray stays true to the Word.  If you're interested, I would suggest the interviews [...] to see if this is worth it.  The interviews are extremely worth it.
