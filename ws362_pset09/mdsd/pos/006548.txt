It would not be an exaggeration to say that the principles and ideas in this book changed my life. I took a few months to read it, trying to fully grasp everything in it. The concepts are very powerful and the ideas are totally inspirational. Every word is not great, and every chapter is not as helpful as some, but reexamining my concepts and attitudes about money helped me to make more money. Honest to God, I make twice as much now as I did a year ago, and I am infinitely more happy with the balance I've acheived. I am buying this 6 of this book for the women in my life for gifts.
