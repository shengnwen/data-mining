The story being told here has been covered by others, namely in `The Samson option' and `Israel and the bomb' however this book not only updates the story regarding the Yom Kippur War but also explores the characters involved, it is a story worth telling again and a brilliant examination of the personalities of Ben-Gurion, Peres and others.  Most familiar with Israel today will be surprised to learn that France was Israel's closest ally in the 1950s, when America opposed Israeli policies.  This book serves as a good account also of the nature of Israeli reasoning regarding the bomb.  This is not a dramatically biased book, so most readers should be able to stomach it, since most people are incapable of reading anything about Israel if it doesn't fit their ideological love-hate of the country, but this book should sidestep this to some extant, unlike `Samson' option it isn't basing its logic on the question of why Jews should or shouldn't be allowed to develop nuclear weapons by using Biblical analysis, rather it is a modern fair book examining how Israel obtained the bomb.  Israel, alone among the many nations who covertly have attempted to develop nuclear weapons secretly(Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, Libya etc...), did not sign the non-proliferation treaty, so as to remain `ambiguous' and thus not in violation, unlike other hypocritical nations who sign the bogus treaty and then build nukes.  Ironically the very same people that condemn Israel's possession of nukes are the same people who condemn America for daring to invade Iraq because of WMDs, in there view Israel possessing WMDs is tantamount to the `holocaust' whereas Iraq or Iran pursuing the same objective is merely for `national defense and sovereignty and combating colonialism'.

A good read, fair, however it is a mostly popular work.
