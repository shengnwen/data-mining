This book has lots of info about the monster and creature movies from the 20's to the 80's. It mostly covers the movies like Frankenstein, Mummy, King Kong, Phantom Of The Opera, and anything with Lon Chaney Jr., Peter Cushing, and Boris Karloff. I wish it had a little more about some modern classics (*cough*TexasChainsawMassacre,FridayThe13h,NightmareOnElmStreet*cough*). However, it does have everything you'll ever need to know about early horror films. And the inroduction by Forrest J. Ackerman was very interesting
