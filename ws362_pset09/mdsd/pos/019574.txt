This is an excellent and useful book. It is thorough, easy to understand, and has a very comprehensive and complete list of styles that it demonstrates very clearly. The 2 cd's that come with the book are also excellent resources for the drummer who is interested in learning more about playing different types of rhythms. Whether you prefer to play from the written examples of the part or to play them from the audio examples, there's a great deal of information contained in these products. Definitely recommendable. Go for it
