This is the original Winnie-ther-Pooh. The one you fell in love with as a child, when it was being read aloud to you by your parents as a bed time story. I have just used the story in an extended essay about english litterature for children, and I can very much recommend it to children, as well as adults. It has, as well as so many fairytales, so much more to it than what you understand as a child, and you ought to read it again as an adult. The only thing to comment on, is the fact that Tigger doesn't appear in this edition, but it is nevertheless extremely charming, and no child should have a childhood without it. A thing to notice is the sweet and interesting introduction by Milne himself, and the just as sweet little drawings and the map of Houndred Acre Wood in the beginning of the book.
