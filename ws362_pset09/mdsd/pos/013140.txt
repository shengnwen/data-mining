This was a gift for my nephew. It's a great beginners Board Book, but please note the dimensions when you purchase this. It is very small which makes it ideal for infants and toddlers, but if you're expecting a large Board Book, you will be disappointed. Nice illustrations, simplified story versus the orignal, but makes a great gift
