As a business owner I HIGHLY recommend this book.  If you are currently selling products and services in a market where the sales cycle tends to drag on, then Short Cycle Selling is a great resource in reducing this potential lenghty process. I found myself stopping to take notes as I read the book. I have already started to implement some of the ideas shared by Jim Kasper.  He does a great job of taking you from the early stages (prospect) all the way through to getting a referral from your client
