This book makes seeing Washington so easy and painless.  The sights are grouped according to location, so you know what you can see together in a short amount of time.  I discovered gems in Washington that I never knew existed!  And just when the kids are getting cranky and hungry, there is a list of good places to eat.  The directions by metro are very helpful and well done.  I highly recommend this book to natives and visitors alike
