This is an inetersting book on recognizing the power of the individual who is either an employee or a customer. Mr. Buckinghanm takes us in an inetresting plot to reveal those ultimate principles we should hold on to to assure maximum sucess in a chaostic world.

Some of his theses are very counterintuitive, at least in a society such as Venezuela where only the top managers or the owners are allowed to think while employees are mindless hands. To make it extreme the leadership of everted by the actual leader of the demagogic-militaristic regime thats in poiwer can be attributed to the principle of leadership described here, where the simplistic power of the message that answers- who do we have to serve? can explain the irrational back up given to the dictatorial thug.
