I bought this book and read most of it in one night; I couldn't put it down because the subject is so fascinating.  A huge number of films are given short reviews: some I knew, some I didn't.  The tome's small size and attractive design helped me keep reading into the wee hours.  But I became gradually more annoyed when I discovered how carelessly the book was written and edited (if there was an editor at all).  Misspells and typos abound:  Herzog's film on Kinski, "My Best Fiend" is shown as "My Best Friend," thus completely missing the point.  Great character actor Theodore Bikel is cited as "Theodore Bickel" - and these are only two out of dozens of similar, inexcusable mistakes.  If Rough Guide can't afford a decent proofreader, maybe they should stick to travel guides.  If they had only been more careful, the book would deserve an enthusiastic five stars, rather than the grudging four stars I give it
