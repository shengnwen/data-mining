Ought to be required reading for anyone building or remodeling their home.  I used the guidelines for building our 5000 sq. ft home in Southern California; infact, I made my architect read it too.  We have eight children, and our home gets just as dirty as anyone else's but it doesn't  show thanks to Aslett's good sense recommendations
