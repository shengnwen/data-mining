Having taught this book several times as an English teacher, I've certainly had my exposure to it.  My view of the novel has certainly changed over time, as I've come to regard the novel for all of its beauty.  I strike a single star from its score simply because I don't believe the book has aged well; it is not accessible and applicable to contemporary America like it was to the generation of adolescents who could still remember that there was such a thing as World War II and that it wasn't almost as long ago as Noah's flood.  To today's teenagers, it comes across as cheesy.  This is truly a shame, suggesting we have reached a period in history in which the naivetï¿½ of youth has been obliterated.  But then, that is what the novel is about, and perhaps it has grown even more meaningful today.  Instead of reading this text as a commentary on individual maturation and the rites of passage associated with it, A Separate Peace must be viewed as a commentary on the development of Modern America, a country that has grown much like Gene, made mistakes like Gene, and has come to realize a state of experience and worldliness that is a far cry from its origins.

The value of Knowles' novel lies, moreover, in its accessibility as an instructional tool.  His use of metaphor and symbolism yields easy discussion to the work's major themes and concepts.  It lacks scope in the its single-minded attention to Caucasian males does not lend itself toward all classrooms, ethnicities, or school districts, but for those two whom it may hold some relevance, there is a great deal to learn from it.  A Separate Peace shows ordinary teenagers encountering and engaging in the same foibles I see my students make on a daily basis.  There is something about Gene that is ubiquitous in all of us, and there is much that can be derived from his narrative.
