Bravo, Greg Tang has done it once again!  This wonderful book is full of authentic masterpieces which Tang recreates to get us looking at the art in a "math kind of way!"  This book is super for all elementary levels, kindergarten through grade five.  The focus is on addition, and the many ways we can group numbers to get to a given sum.  We love it
