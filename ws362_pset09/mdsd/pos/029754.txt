Richard Yates is by far one of the best writers of the past 50 years. His work, other than Revolutionary Road had been underappreciated until the mid-1990's when people started reading his short fiction again. But Revolutionary Road is his masterpiece. Yates is a master storyteller whose work is, as many other reviewers have already said, is timeless.

This book revolves around Columbia graduate Frank and his wife April Wheeler and their suburban lives. Each feels unfulfilled in his or her own way, Frank, someone who while at Columbia is always told great things are in store for him after he graduates and figures out what he wants to do with his life, and April, who mourns an acting career that never took off and instead leaves her pining away her days as a bored housewife. What is remarkable about this work is its ability to capture the trapped feeling one gets when faced with the reality of one's mundane existence. Something always seems just  out of reach for these two and everytime you think their will be a change in their fortune, something happens to leave them right where they started. 

I cannot emphasize enough how fantastic this book is. As someone who studied creative writing, Yates amazes me with the rich texture of his language and the way he captures a person's mindset so perfectly. 

Add this book to the many you must always have at your side
