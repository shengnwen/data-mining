I don't have much more to add than what was already mentioned in the (long) other reviews.

The most entertaining thing for me was that though this book was written many decades ago, it cautions against the very things that have happened recently.  Nothing really seems to change in investing, and overexcited bulls will probably always bid the market up to inappropriate levels, at least for the short term.

By reading CSaUP, maybe you can tell where the next peak will be.  I don't mean a number- I just mean within six months or so, which is all you need to be a shockingly successful investor (the flip side, which is even more important, is telling when stocks are insanely cheap)
