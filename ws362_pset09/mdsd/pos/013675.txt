This epic tragedy pits a beautiful, earthbound angel against a venal, earthbound devil, and is set amid the squalor of Medieval Paris.  Our protagonists alternately dance and skulk through the chapters, leading to a desperate and heart-wrenching conclusion.  Could our angel be a witch; could our devil redeem himself?  We desperately hope for any outcome other than the one we fear, and we cannot believe that Hugo would taunt us with such elemental beauty, and then destroy it before our eyes.  My  only complaint is not with Hugo, but with the translation of the title.  Why couldn't we anglophones be trusted with "Notre Dame of Paris?"  The book is less about Quasimodo than about the conflict between Medieval Paris's lofty aspirations for man and the depredations of daily life
