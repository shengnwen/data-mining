I have put off reading Amy Tan until now, picturing warm fuzzy stories about Chinese people... such a cliche I know and one I am now well aware is incredibly wrong -this was a fantastic book.

Olivia is an American Chinese, her father being Chinese and marrying her mother after coming to America.  When Olivia is five there is news -Olivia has an older sister in CHina who will be coming to live with them.  She is 16 upon arrival and shares a room with Olivia.  Olivia doesn't like her much, considering her to be an embarrasing pain.  She talks constantly, claims to have 'yin eyes' (she can see and speak to dead people) and loves Olivia desperately.  Olivia's mother abandons her to Kwans care, busy with her own life and constant stream of boyfriends.

The main part of the story is when they have grown up, Olivia's marriage has failed and Kwan insists it should not.  Through circumstances the three travel to China and go to Kwan's home town.

This is a magnificent book, all the nuances of Kwan's accent is picked up perfectly.  Her stories of the yin world and her past lives are fantastic and incredibly interesting.  I highly recommend this book
