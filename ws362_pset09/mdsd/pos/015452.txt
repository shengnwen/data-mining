I'll admit it...diet and nutrition is not my strong suit.  I am pretty diligent about drinking a high glycemic index + protein drink following my workouts...but I never really understood why.

Well this book gets into the nitty-gritty about nutrients and how to time them.  

There are areas in the book that are difficult to grasp (at least for me...I'm a real bonehead).  This makes for a tough read at times.

I really did my best to strip it down and take out the parts that were useful and apply them.  I loaned the book to my training partner and I haven't seen it since!

He's been applying the advice in the book and amazingly, he's maintained his bodyweight over the summer...he has a tough time keeping his weight on because his daily work is physically demanding and he's out in the sun ALL DAY LONG.  For a 45 year old guy to make strength gains and maintain his bodyweight...I find it pretty amazing.

Definitely worth the $10 or so..
