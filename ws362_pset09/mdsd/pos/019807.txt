Gathering The Ocean


	Have you ever been on vacation, but your mind is on something else? That was the case for Martha Boyle from the realistic fiction novel Olive's Ocean by Kevin Henkes. Martha is a shy, quiet, and secretive girl who aspires to be a writer. Martha is vacationing at her grandmother's house by the ocean, but she can't stop thinking about Olive Barstow, a girl in Martha's class who recently died in a car crash. Earlier that week, Olive's mother had given Martha a page from Olive's journal saying how Olive had hoped to become one of Martha's friends. Martha tries to write a book about Olive, which nobody knows about except for her grandmother. Martha even tries to bring Olive's mother a piece of the ocean since Olive loved the ocean and had always wanted to go there. 

This book was very interesting because there are two adventures going on at once, Martha's thoughts, and what is actually happening with the people around her. I really liked this book because it was as if Martha was real. She came to life in the story, and she is someone that I think many people will be able to relate to. I would recommend this book to any reader in the 6th or 7th grade because it is a well written and interesting novel that captures you in its words. Kevin Henkes really did a great job with this book; it was hard to put down. If you enjoy this book, you may also like: Al Capone Does My Shirts by Gennifer Choldernko, and The Devil's Arithmetic by Jane Yolen.
