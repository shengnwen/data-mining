The thing about this book is that it makes it seem like if you use tools in your work then your not a psychic. Some of the best psychics I know use divanation tools. Theres nothing wrong with the tarot astrolgy i ching or reading palms. Its like anything else in life. We cant cut wood without a saw. We cant boil water without heat. Same concept. Other than that its a all together great book
