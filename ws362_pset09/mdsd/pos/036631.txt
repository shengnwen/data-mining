Does contain very helpful information for the beginning cook left out of many "general" cookbooks. All the recipes turn out well, unlike recipes in some other cookbooks that seem like nobody ever tried before publishing them. Good for building confidence in a new cook.

I'm sure many buy this book just for the memories. Bought the 1963 "COOKY BOOK" reproduction mostly for the same reason myself. Although... there are some excellent recipes in there that aren't in the newer books...

I agree with the reviewers who said the bread, cake, pie and pastry recipes are still among the best out there. Tried and true classics that everyone should have.

but...

The appetizer and main dish sections are pretty dated, and thin as well. Even some very basic recipes are not in this book. Stuffed cabbage, stuffed peppers, stuffed pork chops, breaded pork chops, etc... alfredo sauce as another reviewer mentioned... you will not find. Although... there are some pretty cool recipes for foods that were popular in the day and might be fun to serve...

I would say a beginning cook or anyone who wants some EXCELLENT baking recipes should have this book, but definitely another general cookbook as well. Something with more and more modern recipes. Do NOT buy this book if you're looking for a single general cookbook that covers almost everything. There are others that come MUCH closer to that (Fanny Farmer Cookbook, newer Betty Crocker, etc...).
