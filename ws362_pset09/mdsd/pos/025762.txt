I absolutely love this book! It is well organised, and has chapters on Shape & Form, Colour & Design, Building & Construction, and several sections at the end which link really well to classroom themes such as various plants, animals and transport projects (all edible!).  I especially love the chapter on making numbers & letters through cooking - some great projects here.  Although it's black and white and has line drawings, it is very well set out and easy to follow.  An outstanding book of Early Childhood Teachers
