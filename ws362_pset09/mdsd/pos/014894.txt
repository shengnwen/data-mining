  This book is simply fantastic.  Recommended to me by a friend, I got introduced to Mr. Bryson's writing four years ago.  This was the first of his novels I read and it is, after reading them all, my favorite.  His writing style is easy to read, and the books, packed with well-researched facts, are informative without being boring.  Several years after reading this novel, I set off Down Under armed with a map, walking shoes, and In A Sunburned Country, dog-eared and highlighted.  It was a great guide, and re-reading some of his reflections about the places that I was now standing before was such a treat.  
  I sincerely promise that if you have a sense of humor, adventure, and curiosity about the world, you'll love this book
