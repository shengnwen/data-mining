This is one of the few Statistics texts to turn to, if you indulge in any sort of independent study. Its contents are broad, and ramified virtually every aspect of core statistics and probability. I particularly valued the way it handled data analyses and result interpretations.
Whether you are interested in Numerical Descriptive Measures, Discrete Probability, Interval Estimation, or Hypothesis Testing, this book has something to make you happy. And, although its Analysis of Varience fell below my expectation, I was compensated by its handling of both Linear Regression and Non-parametric Tests. The outlook of this book is fine, and its topics are straightforward. It makes learning seem effortless!
However, the main downside I noticed is that this book did not explain theorems (and advanced formulae) in details. As a result of this, science and mathematics students may need to acquire additional book for that purpose. But overall, it remains a valuable text: especially for self-teaching students
