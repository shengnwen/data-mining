Full of fascinating stories, quotes and people, this collection held me  enthralled from beginning to end.  Not only useful as a glimpse into the  writers themselves, most of the interviews also give you a taste of the  subject they've written about -- more often than not, I wanted to read the  transcript of the full Booknotes interview (available online)as well as  seek out the books they'd written!  Highly recommended
