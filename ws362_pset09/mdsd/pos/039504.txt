Figes has managed to write an engaging history that reads quickly, yet is rigorous and packed with information.  The work elaborates beautifully on the Russian identity crisis between East and West, as well as the conflict between the peasantry and nobility.  Particularly enjoyable is the coverage of the eastern peoples, such as the Tatars, and the culture of the peasantry. In addition, the author dwells on religion and spirituality -- the role of the Orthodox Church in Russian life, and its various divergent branches -- monastics, ascetics, Old Believers, holy fools and, of course, the mainstream church.

Figes explores many aspects of culture, including literature, music, dance, theatre, painting, and much more.  The work isn't dry, however.  Figes weaves together numerous intriguing tidbits and andecdotes, for example, the tragic life of Anna Akhmatova under the Soviets, or what it means to dine on the "Sheremetev account", or the private operas featuring divas of serf origin. 

It is astonishing that a topic so broad could be covered so competently  in one volume.  "Natasha's Dance" is a superb synthesis that promises a rewarding journey to the history-oriented reader
