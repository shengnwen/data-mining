This was our first Junie B. Jones book and I think I loved it more than my 5yr old daughter. I laughed out loud several times and at one point my daughter asked me to stop laughing so I could get back to reading the story. And of course we can't stop singing Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg
