I used the 1001 physics book and a national prep course to prepare for my MCAT.  I scored a 12 on the physical sciences.  I found the 1001 physics book to be accurate in the science and a strong pedagogic tool for learning the concepts.  There were some (but really very few) typos in the book, and I didn't find them myself, but they were posted on the examkrackers website and appear to be updated regularly.  Additionally, Examkrackers provides a bulletin board where Jon Orsay himself actually responds quickly to science questions that relate to the book.  Mr. Orsay explains on this site that the 1001 books are designed to teach MCAT science and that passages allow you to answer questions without knowing the science.  That's why these questions are not passage based.  He actually suggests using a different book if you are already scoring 10s in the science section and he says that you should definitely supplement this book with a review book and full length exams.  Anyway, I thought the book was pretty good, and I don't think I would have done so well without it
