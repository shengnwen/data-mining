This was one of the best in the Monk series.  I devoured it in one weekend.  The storyline was exciting and the returning characters of Scuff and the rat catcher were endearing.  The development between Monk and Runcorn is getting interesting too... more in depth; less one dimensional. We seem to need to find a place for Hester to work that satisfies her and gives her room to help Monk solve the mysteries.   Similar problem seems to occur for Charlotte Pitt. I guess a Victorian woman can't "have it all".  Keep the Monk series coming... plus the Pitt series.  Love them both
