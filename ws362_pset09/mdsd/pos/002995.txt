I have never been in a "surprise child" situation, but once I opened this book I couldn't put it down.  Leslie Fields writes so compellingly and beautifully about the realities of pregnancy and birth, anyone involved in parenthood in any way will feel pierced to the heart by this book.  Fields tells the true stories of many women here who have overcome the overwhelming challenges of unplanned pregnancy by clinging to hope and finding courage they didn't know they had.  Hope and courage is required of all parents, but these brave women are especially inspiring.  Most important, Fields gives us in this book the gift of truth.  Without diminishing the wonder and joy of motherhood, she is willing to speak frankly about what any pregnancy costs in a woman's life.  Women faced with the grief and pain of unplanned pregnancy will be greatly relieved to find that someone understands and is willing to speak of anger, pain, loss--yet still point the way to hope.
