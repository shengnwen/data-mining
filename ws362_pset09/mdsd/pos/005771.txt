This is a great short primer on branding and some of the critical mistakes to avoid. On first blush some of the laws seem counter intuitive, but the authors provide fabulous real world examples to prove their point. Also provides a bonus section on Internet branding, which is an entirely different animal. A must read for any small company delving into branding for the first time!
