I agree with a previous poster that Thoreau comes across as arrogant throughout the book, but he makes some striking observations on humanity, civilization, the pursuit of wealth, and enjoying nature.  This is a book that everyone should read at some point in their life, preferably sooner rather than later.  It is thought-provoking and entertaining
