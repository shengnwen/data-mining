Luckiest Man by Jonathan Eig provides an engrossing, encompassing portrait of Lou Gehrig -- a complex man who despite his many insecurities became one of baseball's and America's finest heroes. Eig presents it all, ranging from Gehrig's growing up with a very domineering mother, to his humbleness and constant self-doubt despite his many outstanding achievements, to his  relationships with his teammates and especially Babe Ruth, to his desire to let his actions rather than his mouth promote his abilities, to his relationship with women and his wife, and finally to his courage in battling the disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), that he contracted at the zenith of his careed and that ultimately took his life at the young age of thirty-six. Eig's skill as a writer is demonstrated by his ability to make you want to stay glued to your seat while absorbing a wealth of information about this fascinating man.  You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy Luckiest Man -- just a person who enjoys learning about a man who deservedly has become an American icon.
