I could not put this down. Just as riviting as Koontz's Intensity.  If you like psychological thrillers, this one is for you. It's unbelievable how this professional psychiatrist uses the mind control skills he's perfected on patients he treats. Characters are extremely well developed. Loved this one. Be afraid, very afraid, next time you see your shrink
