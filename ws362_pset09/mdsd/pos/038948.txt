I read this book after reading the Foxfire book on blacksmithing in my quest to learn more. Bealer goes into great detail about techniques and tools of the trade. I would recomend this book to anybody interested in taking up blacksmithing as a hobby. A word of caution is in order here though; no book can teach you all of this skill. I would recomend, in addition to reading this book, locating a smith or a college with a blacksmithing course near you and talking to them to really learn the trade. That being said, this book is a great and accurate introduction to the art. This book is economical enough that even if you don't pursue blacksmithing as a hobby, you won't be out too much and will still have all of that wonderful knowledge
