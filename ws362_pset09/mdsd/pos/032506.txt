The book I read was great. It was Island of the Blue Dolphins. The book was about a girl who lived alone on an island. I loved all the adventure. If you like adventure you will like "Island of the Blue Dolphins". One event is the boat leaves karana gets left alone on the island. The theme is survival of the fittest. I can't wait to read "Zia" the sequel to "Island of the Blue Dolphins" by Scott O'Dell. If you read "Island of the Blue Dolphins" try reading "Zia"
