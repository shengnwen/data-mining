As a lover of dogs for over 50 years, I own dozens of books about canine care and behavior, but Stanley Coren's 'How to Speak Dog' is definitely my favorite. I originally found this informative dog communication book in my local library after adopting a lovable but fearful mixed breed from my local humane society five years ago. Since then, I have bought at least six copies of this same book online, just to have on hand to give to friends and family who decide to bring a dog into their life or who don't understand the behavior of a dog already living with them. I especially like the book's detailed descriptions of a dog's specific body language (ears, eyes, mouth, tail) and what each means--as well as its guide to the messages a dog is sending when he barks or whines in a particular way. Not unlike a driver's training manual which must be read by those who wish to become licensed drivers, 'How to Speak Dog" should be required reading for every person who decides to share his or her life with a dog.
