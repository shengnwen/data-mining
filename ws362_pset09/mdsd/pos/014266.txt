If I am about to cook something that I am not completely sure about, I will spend a few seconds looking it up in this book first.  My cooking has improved dramatically since I have been using this and Bittman's wonderful &quot;How to Cook Everything,&quot; which I find to be more exhaustive than this terse treasure.  Brilliant is a joy to leaf through, a reliable reference, and a wonderfully instructive kitchen guide.  My dining guests are envious of the skills I have gained from this book and I am constantly tempted to try new dishes and old ones prepared in novel ways.  I recommend this as the most rewarding cooking reference to reach for first
