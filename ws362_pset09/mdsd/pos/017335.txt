If you want to know the plot, you can read the many versions in the earlier reviews.  Like another reviewer before me, I'd rather read the book before I know the plot--especially in a mystery novel.  But, I'll try to provide some value-added in a different regard.  Lawrence Block has basically 3 series.  Two are tongue-in-cheek (the Bernie Rhodenbarr the caring burglar and the Tanner "spy" series) and one is serious (Matt Scudder).  I enjoy them all, but expect different things from them.  In the Burglar series you usually get a lot of fun with Bernie getting into and out of trouble throughout, with humorous lines, delightful (if sometimes strange) characters, etc.  In this one, the author points out the continuing evidence of lots of coincidences throughout the caper.  He intentionally sacrifices credibility of events for humor and sheer fun.  The Tanner books are similar in that regard.  This particular offering is particularly coincidental and particularly fun--one of the most fun in the entire series, IMHO.  Don't expect a Scudder-type book.  They are wonderful (maybe more so) in their own right, but very different from the Bernie books.  So, if you want a real whodoneit with all seriousness --where you try to figure out the guilty party etc. from the clues--read the Scudder books or Agatha Christie.  If you want a really fun and humorous rollicking read, this is a great choice.  Enjoy!!!  p.s. It probably deserves at least another 1/2 star, but then I like Scudder better.  Don't ask me why
