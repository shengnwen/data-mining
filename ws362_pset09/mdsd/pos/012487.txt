One of the great creative geniuses of our time, Doctorow kept me intrigued right until the very last page.  I never felt the need to see the movie, sometimes that ruins it for me.  The plot is killer and he's true to his subject.  It kept me entertained and warded off the blahs during a boring teacher's conference
