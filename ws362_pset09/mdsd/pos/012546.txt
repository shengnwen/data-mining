Abstract language theory is hard, but Languages and Machines does a very good job of explaining the subject step by step. The topics are covered extremely thoroughly and with just the right amount of rigor.  As for those who claim it's not exciting enough, you can't get blood out of a stone.  Only the most dedicated computer scientist and mathematicians will find this topic interesting.  Even so, this book does a superb job of tying theory to application (e.g., the machines one can use language theory to build) for even the most obscure concepts (like the Greibach Normal Form).

That being said, there are a few problems.  First, the author's claim that this is a book for undergrads is not credible (except perhaps at MIT or CalTech).  Even my graduate students have to read sections multiple times to "get it".  Second, the author needs to provide solutions to selected problems at the back of the textbook.  Most theory books do this, but not this one.  This is a major weakness, especially given the difficulty of the material.  Lastly, Sudkamp's proofs are extremely dry and very difficult to follow.  He should take a cue from Sipser's excellent book (Intro to Theory of Computation) and introduce "proof ideas" to give the big picture for important proofs
