Robert Coover's first novel, Origin of the Brunists, shows how he won so many awards for his poetry and short fiction.  This is a book you won't forget. The book throws a strange group of definitely substandard people together, adds a set of bizarre events, shakes, and comes up with the most bizarre - but plausible - religion you have ever seen.  Metaphysics, virtual Forteanism, downright stoicism, you name it, it gets thrown in and sort of works.  The book is a study of the individuals, not the religion, but the religion serves to hold the people together. I haven't read this book in 15 years, and I'm aching to get another copy. If you like this book, try Coover's Universal Baseball Association - J. Henry Waugh, Prop., or a collection of his poetry and shortstuff, Pricksongs and Other Delights.  At least one of these is in print
