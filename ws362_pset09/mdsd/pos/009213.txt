This book was a great introduction to the basics of mortgage-backed securities, exactly as the title professes.  It is loaded with graphs and tables to help readers understand the quantitative sections.

If you really want to understand this subject though, read Fabozzi and Modigliani's "Mortgage and Mortgage-Backed Securities Markets" as well as (or even in lieu of) this book.  It dates back to the 80s, but together with this book you will have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, and you can easily understand recent developments
