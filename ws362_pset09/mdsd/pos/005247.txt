This is an excellent book, not only for tourists and visitors to the Monterey Peninsula, but also for those considering relocating there (like me).  I wanted a book about the region that describes the neighborhoods and  towns in order to get a general feel for the area (information pertinent to  those contemplating a move), and this book does just that.  It is amazing  how much information the authors have managed to jam into each page, and  they have included a good deal of local history.  The book is written in a  witty, engaging, almost conversational style.  Unlike many books of this  genre, the blurbs about restaurants, inns, and everything else are written  descriptively, rather than subjectively or from the authors' personal  points of view (which may differ from the reader).  In short, this is a  very well-written book from two people who clearly love the peninsula on  which they live
