Under Western Eyes is not a light novel but a deep, refelctive study of the Russian intellect and society. This book permitted me to understand what we westerner's often cast of as the &quot;Russian personnality&quot; and the complexity of the historical, social and psychological climate of Russia and the Russians shortly before the Bolshevik revolution. This novel does not ressemble any ohter of Conrad's as it has a strange feeling or atmosphere to it that can barely be grasped. I read it when I was young and I was deeply affected by the people he describes and the locations. A must for anyone interested or related to the Russian nation
