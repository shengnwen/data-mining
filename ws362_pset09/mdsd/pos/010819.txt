Molecular cloning has been a lab staple for years. Now reprinted so you can update the old lab copy worn out by years of student use! Its a must have for any lab serious about molecular biology. Its also useful for student training. Many times there are simple explanations for the lab techniques we have adopted as dogma, but are unsure why. Molecular cloning has the answers and is a great resource. I highly recommend this book for its depth and breadth of protocols and guidance in the complicated realm of cloning
