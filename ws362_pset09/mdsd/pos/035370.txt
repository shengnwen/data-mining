I tend to be cynical about self-help books. I bought this one because I was unhappy in my relationship and beating myself up about it. How could I even contemplate leaving a kind, gentle man who had never done me wrong?  

This book gave me the explanation.  Reading this book, anyone in a troubled relationship will have "Aha!" moments when something really strikes a chord. I can't explain what a huge relief it is, to see your own feelings in black and white, and realise it's not unusual to feel that way and you're not going crazy.

I don't agree that reading the book would encourage someone to leave.  People who think that, have obviously just skimmed the book and done little more than answer the questions at the end of each chapter.  You can't read this book like that - you must study it thoroughly and carefully.

Throughout, the author repeatedly points out that you only need one strong "Yes" answer to ONE of the chapters, to make the relationship worth trying to save. 

The book gave me clarity on my relationship at the time, and I decided to try to hang on.  However events overtook me and we did end up splitting up.  

I now have a new relationship and find that the knowledge I gained from the book is stil useful.  We had some huge fights and some difficult times at the start, but knowing that this relationship had so many resounding "Yes!" answers (to several chapters) helped me keep those hiccups in perspective, and I have never been happier.
