I have been reading an average of 2 books a month. Yet I throw most of them away after reading. This is one of a few books I keep in my library. And it is the third time I bought it because every time someone borrow the  book, I never got it back. Books That Changed The World summarizes the  influences of the great books to the way we believe in things, some of  which we take it for granted now. Things like the solar system,  gravitational force. I hardly give a five-star to any book reviews, but  this one well deserves it
