I chose this book because it seemed like a nice easy-going read. All in all it was a great read. This book was kind of slow in the beginning but picked up towards the middle. The whole book is set in the fictional world of the undiscovered seventh tapestry of The Lady and the Unicorn. 
   The book starts in Medeval times with a rich girl named Adele Le Viste who falls in love with a common person. It then morphs into modern day Paris with a museum curator Alex Benoit and her ex boyfriend Jake Bowman. It is a nice love story but somewhat predictable. There are similarities between Adele and modern age Alex. 
  Even though this book has a slow start it is a great book and I would recommend it for some light easy reading
