J.A. Jance is one of the best writers out there.  This book starts out a little slow because she is telling the reading about the Sherrif & her family but once the crimes start you can not put it down. The crimes are very violent & scary. She is short staffed & she has two murders she has to solve. It all takes place in Arizona & because she is short staffed she has to go out into the field herself.
