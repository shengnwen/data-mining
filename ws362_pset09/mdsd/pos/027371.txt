...people will look at this like we look at Euclid's Elements today, it's just one of those immortal books. Hardy starts by constructing the real numbers &amp; then doing all the calculus you'd ever want to know, and with a bunch of math 'trivia' that can't be found anywhere. I can't add much to what the other reviewers have said, except this book has some evil integrals from old Cambridge Tripos exams that would make some Putnam problems look easy. lol At least, if you're only allowed to use real variables (&amp; not complex variables &amp; residues). Get this book for an excellent reference no matter what level you're at
