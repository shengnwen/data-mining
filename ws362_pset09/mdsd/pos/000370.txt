This is an excellent translation of some of the pseudepigraphal writings that didn't quite make it into the modern day canon of scripture. The translations are very well footnoted with alternative explanations or examples from other manuscripts so that the full meanings are not lost. This book is large, so make sure that the binding and the pages are fully attached; mine arrived somewhat detached and for that the book will creak and probably cause some problems later on. I discovered the problem with the book after the full return period had expired. This book also complements volume II very well. With both volumes, the reader should have the majority of the pseudepigrapha for research/enjoyment. See also "The Other Bible" by Willis Barnstone for further abridgement of Gnostic, Kabbalistic, and pseudepigraphal works
