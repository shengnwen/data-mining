Many people say this book was not Grisham's best, but I do believe they missed his point of the story.  This book actually moved me to the awareness of the homeless.  Most of us sit in a comfortable chair reading and say, "Entertain me now!"  I do highly doubt that an attorney would leave his prized job to do what he did, but it is possible.  Some would say to stay put with the firm and use that income to save the homeless.  In this story, Michael Brock decides to hit the pavement, dodge personal attacks on him and make a difference in D.C.  This book moved me to be aware of the less fortunate in my own community, and I will do more to help others who need it
