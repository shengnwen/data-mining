Probably not for the weak of heart. I remember when I was a kid and saw the movie "Rio Bravo". This book gave me the same feeling. In your face, the way it may have been, rough and tough, blood and guts, sweat and pain 1800's western. 
McCarthy paints a vivid picture in a book that is hard to put down. At times it is more information than you need to know buy like seeing a car wreck, you have to look.
You like hard core, no quarter given reading. This book is for you. You like, feel good "Black Beauty" lovey dovey reading, run away from this book
