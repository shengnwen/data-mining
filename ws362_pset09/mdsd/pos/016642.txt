Bon Appetit certainly is my pick for finding inspiring new recipes to try.  They easily excite me to try more than Gourmet or Food & Wine.  

Here is celebrative collection from their 23 years of over 1200 recipes. Think of it, one has to decide likely from over 50,000 recipes which only 1/5th will make it in.  In seeing which of my favorites from the magazine I saved and continue to make to the joy of my diners, few of them made it in the cut.

However, surveying those that did, there are many one will like to try, e.g. Crab and wild mushroom cheesecake; Escarole and orzo sop with Turkey-parmesan meatballs;  Salmon Burgers with hoisin and ginger;  Sausage, cheese and basil lasagna; Wild rice and jasmine rice pialf with apricots and cashews; Roast Tenderloin of beef with mushroom-port sauce; Braised lamb shanks with winter squash and red chard; Chianti-braised stuffed chicken thighs on egg noodles; Grilled red snapper and mango with cilantro-lime vinaigrette; Pan-seared tuna with ginger-shitake cream sauce; Potato, leek, Gruyere, and oyster mushroom gratin; Maple and tangerine-glazed carrots; Roasted Vegetables with balsamic-lemon vinaigrette; Stilton and hazelnut drop biscuits; Mascarpone cheesecake with roasted cashew crust and passion fruit caramel sauce; Pear Crostada with late-harvest Riesling; Pineapple, mango and papaya squares.

What many reviewers have said comparing this giant collection to cousin's Gourmet's cookbook is true to this reviewer: this one seems more targeted to more basic recipes with some twist, while Gourmet's is more creative.  The magazine doesn't always sqauare up like this, but seems majority of this recipes chosen for cookbook do.  However, as my sample hopes to demonstrate, there are still many worthwhile ones here to try
