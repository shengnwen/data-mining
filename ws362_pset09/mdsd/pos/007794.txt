Hollingdale worked side by side with the dean of all Nietzsche scholars, Walter Kaufmann, for many years.  His biography of Nietzsche parallels Kaufmann's groundbreaking study &quot;Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist&quot;, a watershed in American Nietzsche scholarship.  While Kaufmann's work has been eclipsed (see R. Schacht's &quot;Nietzsche&quot;) in terms of philosophical sophistication, Holligdale's biography of Nietzsche remains the very best in detail, breadth, cogency, and intimacy.  Its style is unobtrusive and flowing, making it easily accessible to both the everyday reader and the student of the history of ideas. It is indispensible to anyone with even the slightest interest in Nietzsche
