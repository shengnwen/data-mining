I am not new development but I try to read books of all levels.  Knowing the author of the book I was curious and I like to read intro books like this to help when I mentor developers.  I can compare what they know to what is contained in the book.  If well written, I suggest the book, and this is a certainly a book I recommend.  It lays out the topics I think are required especially in Part II.  Was very happy to see Chapter 6 - Building Class Libraries because too often beginner books make it seem as if class libraries are not an entity to themselves but a piece of either win forms or web forms in .NET.  I think this will make it much clearer to the novice.  The chapter on debugging distilled the info to a good level to make someone effective instead of overloading with everything Visual Studio can do.  Part III covered specific topics that I would not want to explain on my own.  The information is readable and not over done.  Part IV goes on to pickup some topics I would not have thought to include.  Not every new developer will need to read these, but having these simple examples to refer to will be especially helpful to someone who is new to .NET but with some background in Visual Basic.  Part V along with all the tips in the books, and the cheat sheets make this book even more valuable.  If you are on the fence about this book, pick it up off the shelf at a local book store to get a feel for Bill's writing style.  I think the conversational feel of the text makes it much nicer than the other books of the same technical depth on the topic
