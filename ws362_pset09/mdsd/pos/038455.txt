I do believe this is the original, copyright 1979; an updated version came out in 1998.  When the later edition came out, I was quite distraught, thinking that I would never find the "original."  A dear friend and I searched second-hand books stores while in Yorkshire many years ago, and discovered the "original" is still readily available.  Of the two, I found the "original," this one, so much the better of the two.  If you are fortunate enough to visit Yorkshire as a tourist, this book will provide a memory of that wonderful place. Yorkshire was a personal journey for me so James Herriot may not affect others the way he affects me, but this is more than just a coffee-table book.  Excellent writing; great description of the area by a man who truly loved Yorkshire
