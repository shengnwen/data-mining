This book is probably the best known of all the books about this case.It is the book the 1996 Mini-series starring Laura Dern and Randy Quaid was based on. It is well researched and put together.
The book  makes a fair attempt to stay neutral, but I think it was a bit too critical of the Weavers and too sympathetic towards the government on  a couple of points.That does not at all diminish its value  for someone seeking to learn about this case.Its an invaluable resource.The coverage of the trial is astounding. It spans several chapters and is intricately detailed.
The whole trial is covered from the pretrial preparations to the day Randy walked out of jail.

At the end of the book, I felt like I  had just been on a long journey through these tragic events .I felt emotionally wrung out. I have been following this case  for a long time and already knew a lot about the case but I ended up feeling even more saddened and outraged at what happened to the Weaver family, and I think reading this would make the majority of people marginally sympathetic to the Weavers, no matter how much we disagree with their religious beliefs.If you want to hear the story reported from both sides, this is the book for you.
