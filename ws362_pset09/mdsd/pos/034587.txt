What I really like about Ernest Holmes is that he was all inclusive - he welcomed all spiritual beliefs and he frequently mentioned them. It was inspiring to discover ancient mystical thought (we are one with a Creator) in his writings and pleased that he wrote about philosophy in an easy-to-understand style. The prayers and affirmations in this small volume have sustained me and guided me for years. I quoted from This Thing Called You many times when I was Editor and Publisher of Science of Mind magazine, and I know the readers were inspired by them. In times of stress and challenge I always turn to my favorite line: "The Mind within me, being God, is not afraid of anything...at the center of my being there is complete poise, perfect faith and confidence." And I was comforted.  Elaine Maginn Sonne, PhD, is author of 5 books including Legends of the Stones
