This comprehensive encyclopedia contains hundreds of entries (from Abracadabra to the Zagarramurdi Witches) and over a hundred illustrations. Explaining its nature as a holistic religion that emphasizes the sanctity of life and the unity of all things, it provides a survey of witchcraft from its early pagan roots to the present, including the periods of persecution like the Inquisition and the Salem witch trials. Included are biographical profiles of leading modern witches, many with interviews. Some prominent personalities include Patrcia Crowther, Laurie Cabot and Margaret Adler and there is also an interesting piece on Carl Weschke, the magician and founder of Llewellyn Publications
