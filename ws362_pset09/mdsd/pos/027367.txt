Jonathan Kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years, particularly the Alex Delaware novels.  This - non-Delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning.  I even put it down a time or two thinking I'd never get where he was going, but I'm glad I persisted.  It turned out to be very well worth it.  This is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim.  Eh?  Got the hairs standing up?  He is befriended (in an odd circumscribed manner) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening.  As the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he's not sure who to ascribe them to.  This is a well plotted, very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning.  Kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery.  Loved it!
