In the book Junie B. Jones and her big fat mouth was very funny.
She loves to tell something that she was not suppose to tell. Sometimes Junie B. Jones, mouth can get her into a lot of trouble, like in school. It's Job Day, in Junie B.'s class. Junie B. yells out to the whole class what she's going to be. I'm going to paint like Charlotte, unlock stuff like Roger, and save people like William. But she didn't know what she wanted to be. Little kids like Junie B. Jones, are like that sometimes....
Big Kids too! Whoever, loves to laugh, this book is the right one. I hope you enjoy it!!!
