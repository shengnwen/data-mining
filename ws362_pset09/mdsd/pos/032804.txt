All the makings of a epic, so forget 'the rules'! 

I have absolutely no reservation in recommending this wonderfully insightful book on the fine, but martial art, of mating.

No other work (and ive recently read quite a few), sheds so much light on the complex reproductive strategies and counter-strategies of men and women, both of our conscious and subconscious mind, and more subversively, that of our magnificently diabolical bodies.  
Throughtout, i was a repaeted astounded at the information contained within, and although it may have been a 'dumbed down' version of his more scientifically targeted thesis, this book is by no means lightweight. After many a scene, i was left to ponder the deeper significance of his observations. 

In retrospect, i was socially ignorant, but thanks to this reality check, so honestly expressed by this author, i find myself in understanding of the behaviour that had me so often bewildered at my fellow humans.
My heart felt gratitude goes out the author for this wonderful book !
