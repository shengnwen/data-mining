I lost my Dad in January 2006 to heart disease.  These last months have been by far the most sickening in my life.  The struggle to get through the pain is sometimes more than one can take. I have read at least half a dozen books on Grief.  Maybe one out of that six was semi-helpful.  This book however is the one that I read to get me through the day.  Each and every single day and every thing that is said in the book provides some kind of comfort.  I bought a copy of the book for my Mom and two of my friends that have lost someone close in addition to recommending it to others.  With deepest gratitude I thank the author - and I know she must still be struggling with the pain of losing her daughter.
