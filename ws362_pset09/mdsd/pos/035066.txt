When Rabbit Howls takes the reader through the time during therapy to uncover the horrors the troops of Truddi Chase live with.  It is a gripping story, at times difficult to follow so reading the Introduction, Authors' Note and Epilogue is very enlightening.  It is amazing the author was able to create the story from the journal kept, recounting the flashes of memory that gradually lead to the discovery of the 92 different personalities within Truddi Chase.  The accounts of traumatic events are shocking.  One can understand how healing this effort must be.  I can see why this was a NY Times #1 bestseller.  A good read to expand your range of books.  This book presents some nice thought challenges as you try to figure out what the author is referring to in the writing.  Certainly a nice change of pace if you're in a boring reading rut.
