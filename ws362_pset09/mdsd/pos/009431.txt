This was a good book regarding abusive relationship.  I have never been in abusive situation.  But I have known people that have been.  You always ask, &quot;Why do you stay?&quot;  But after reading this book I finally got the answer.  Eric just was a very awful man with problems within his self.  Poor Ruth, she was just his punching bag.  How can you claim you love someone and treat them badly like he did.  Things he done was very uncalled for.  Then when Ruth finally got out of the situation with Eric (husband), and finally got the nerve to meet someone, Adrian walks in here life, then out.  I felt so sorry for Ruth, but Adrian had nerve.  I understand he wanted to be a father to his child, but there are other ways to handle the sistuation.  I think he was just being selfish there.  I don't know if I could had forgiven Adrian and took him back or not.  Something to think about.  Get the book
