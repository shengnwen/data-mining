Eloquently argued thesis for why peace in the middle east is not only possible, but in the best interest of all the peoples who live there. Unfortunately, I feel that the premises are naive and the entire arguement fails when one considers that Hamas and the other rejectionist groups will never accept Israel's existence, no matter how much Israel is willing to compromise. That a huge number of Palestinians (majority?) agree with the "terrorists'" position and hate Jews and will never accept the concept of giving away any "holy" Arab land leaves hope for peace quite impotent. The book makes logical sense, but passions do not respond to logic, especially in the middle east
