I had read somewhere that "The Woman In White"  was the original mystery novel and was the classic to measure all later ones by.  After a slow start I became very engaged with the subtle clues and flowery vocabulary.  The book is a chance to experience a Victorian past that adds a special touch to an interesting story.
