This book introduced me to Logsdon work.  I've since read it over several times.  He speaks what he thinks with no varnish of correctness.  Incredibly refreshing these days.  Covers apsects of rural society in the  modern world.  For an outsider that wishes to gain some perspective on the  &quot;problem&quot; and the promise of rural America this is a great place  to start and finish up
