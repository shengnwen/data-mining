First of all, a few background details regarding me, the reviewer.  Though Coetzee is a Nobel prize winner, the only book of his I have read is Disgrace, a dark, but rewarding, psychologically engaging novel(la).  Given that brief experience, I had high hopes for this work - hopes that were only partially unrequited.  Secondly, I read this immediately after finishing Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. Thus, I had certain contextual expectations in mind and - well, mileage may vary.

That said, I think that this is a very interesting twist on the Crusoe story.  There are several levels at which the reader will likely reexamine Crusoe (particularly if the Defoe reading is fairly fresh).  Not only does Coetzee take on the authority of Defoe, but also Crusoe, and perhaps even his own protagonist, Susan Barton.  Moreover, the way in which Friday is employed (in the literary sense) raises interesting questions of colonialism, identification, and language.  While Defoe presents Friday as a rather capable cannibal, Coetzee shows us a mute victim of man's violence.  

The real weak spots of this work are that 1) it is a reinterpretation of an existing work, and these never really seem to "pull it off" (though this one comes closer than most), 2) given my limited reading of Coetzee, I am still quite capable of saying that this is not his strongest work, and 3) Coetzee tries to talk through a female character and, being male, I'm not sure that this really works.  

The above criticisms laid out, I would still recommend this book.  I would recommend (re-)reading Daniel DeFoe's Robinson Crusoe first, however.  I suspect that the typical reader will find enough interesting twists upon the original tale that both works will be stronger in the imagination afterwards
