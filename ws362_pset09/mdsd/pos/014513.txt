I am still not finished with the book (I am reading it out of order and at a leisurely pace), but I am also familiar with Beiser from his book, _The Fate of Reason_. Beiser's main virtue is clarity. He says what he wants to say in a clear, straightforward manner, with no wasted flourishes, no distracting jargon, no self-important bombast. In other words, precisely what a beginner needs. Even if one comes from a different perspective than Beiser's, one knows where he stands--and he seems to have read everything, and I mean everything--so that one can make one's judgments about his position without any guesswork as to what it is. Beiser is not interested in impressing or mystifying his reader, but rather in helping his reader. Given that Hegel himself is often so difficult to read (in whatever language), Beiser's orientation to Hegel's thought as a whole (taking into account the development of that thought) is a great service. His main goal seems to be to prevent the reader from wasting their time following long-ago superseded misconceptions about Hegel (such as the shopworn "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" idea of the dialectic, or the idea of intellectual intuition, etc.)
