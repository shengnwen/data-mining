Despite its title, "Breast Cancer Husband" is really a book that I'd highly recommend not only to husbands but to siblings, children, parents, friends--in short, to anyone who cares about a woman with breast cancer--as well to the woman herself. The book has much to recommend it: thorough research, jargon-free prose, experts' opinions, survivors' stories, common-sense advice, humaneness and sensitivity, and (this came as a surprise) moments of true hilarity. After you've read it and absorbed its lessons (sample: Shut up and listen), you may be tempted to say, "I knew that!" Guess what? You didn't.
