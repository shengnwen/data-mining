Little Star an adaptation of the Wish Upon a Star teleplay, which tells the story of Dora and Boots witnessing Little Star getting knocked out of the night sky by a comet. 

Like many Dora stories, they must cross 3 obstacles to reach their goal. In Little Star, Dora and Boots must venture past Troll Bridge and solve the Grumpy Troll's number riddle (counting how many stars in the sky), go past Tico's Tree and then make their way to Tall Mountain. 

When they arrive at Tall Mountain, they must figure out a way to reunite Little Star with his friend, the Moon. Of course, along the journey, Swiper needs to be reminded "no swiping!"

Little Star is a great bedtime story for young readers. If you're looking for a Dora book that teaches your child several Spanish words, however, you'll be disappointed. (In that case, you'd be much better off with Good Night, Dora! which teaches children the Spanish terms for 8 different animals.
