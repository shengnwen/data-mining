Andy's neighbors are off on a business trip.  Andy and his friend Tamica are watching over the house for them while they are gone. They start to see signs that there is someone living in the house.  They call the police but they find no sign of forced entry.  Andy and Tamica keep invetigating and find out that an artist couple has been given permission to stay at the house while the owners are gone.  
	This is the fifth book in the Andy Russell series. Kids will enjoy this if they have read others in the series.

I would recommend this book. I feel that kids can relate to the characters in the book well.
