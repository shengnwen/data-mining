I was first introduced to this book in one of my graduate literacy courses and I have been hooked every since.  The teachers at my school pass it around constantly looking for ideas. My favorite aspect of this book is the fact that there are real teachers giving real examples of what works in their classrooms.  There are no strategies that seem too hard implement in your classroom, because the layout is right there!!  You know it can be done and it words because the examples in the book are proof!  You don't feel like you are reading about some ideal or Utopia of a classroom. You are reading about REAL classrooms. I absolutely love it
