On the outside, this is a gorgeous volume, and it looks good on a bookshelf.  However I don't recommend anyone be introduced to Kingdom Come this way.  I don't know if its the enlarged pages or what, but the reproduction of Alex Ross's glorious art looks surprisingly grainy, with rather dull and degraded colors.  It really looks like crap, and everyone I've shown this edition to agrees.

Kingdom Come is a great story, which is why this still gets four stars, but DC Comics get a huge middle finger for making the actual COMIC look so ugly on the page.

Buy the trade.  It's about sixty bucks cheaper and looks much, much better
