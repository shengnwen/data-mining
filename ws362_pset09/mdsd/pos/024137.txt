I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes to garden and is looking for some shortcuts and time saving tips. It is delightful reading ... by no means is this another gardening reference manual. I must have 50 friends, relatives, and neighbors who would love to read this handy book while swinging in THEIR hammock! After 5 years, I still go back to it for idea
