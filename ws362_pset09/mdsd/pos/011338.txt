Compelling story about the devistating effects of fire on women and children.  Shows the lack of preparedness, back then, of the entire emergency system from fire department to hospital.  Shows how an excellent fire investigator can 'peel back the onion' and finds information through good synthesis and analysis of the facts.  Brings to bear the life safety issues of large public events
