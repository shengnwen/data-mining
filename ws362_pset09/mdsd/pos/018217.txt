The Witch Family is about two girls who while drawing witches pretend to banish the head witch, also known as Old Witch, to a glass hill because she is very wicked.  If you multiply the "Old" with one million, you get some idea of how old she was!  The girls also let Old Witch do her abracadabra so that she can have a witch girl named Hannah and a witch baby.  Old Witch gets to be wicked only on Halloween.  At the end, the two girls take pity on Old Witch and turn the glass hill into a real hill with grass.  After that, Old Witch is not wicked anymore except on Halloween.  I think this is a good book to read on Halloween
