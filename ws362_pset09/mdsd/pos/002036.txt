I'm a fan of Gemmell's Drenai series.  I like his writing, although I recognize that it's formulaic, I think he has a great turn of phrase, characters with multifaceted motivations, and a talent for battle prose.  His ability to transfer humor, annoyance, and comraderie is stellar.  But that's enough about Mr. David Gemmell.  This book is pretty good.

Pretty interesting take on a centuries old mythos, and probably truer to the originations of that story than other modern tales.  The "colors" were a bit hard to get into, and I felt they left me with the idea that every "magic system" had been done and there was a stretch here to find something a bit creative.  Came off in some ways, but not completely.

The story moves right along and for the most part you come to care about those you started out hating, a tried and true Gemmell formula for sure.  But I felt that the timeline jumped about a little too much and in the end I wanted some of the subplots more fleshed out.  The word I'm looking for is "abrupt".  This book has that quality.

It's really a 3.5, but I'm rounding up for David since I like the way his mind works and it's a decent novel that stands on it's own.  You are unlikely to be let down by this one.  In many ways, I sense a similarity to the Drenai series and wonder if this wasn't a storyline he wanted to pursue in that world, but felt that he couldn't make it work.  But I haven't read any of his other "worlds" yet, so maybe that's a common theme with him.
