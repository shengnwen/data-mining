I went looking for a good reference book for teaching my high school students about the "lower" Kingdoms (Monera, and Protista).  This is an exceptional book for just that purpose.  The organization is good, there are lots of excellent photos and diagrams to assist students with identifications.  The simplicity of the book in terms of "just enough information" is what makes it such a valuable reference.  I would highly recommend it for any science classroom
