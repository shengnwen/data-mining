This was my first end times novel and while I agree with some of the criticisms of the writing style, etc., what Meier did for me as a new Christian was immeasurable! If anything, the book gives a complete, albeit simplistic, overview of the Rapture through the Second Coming of Jesus.  I consider it a &quot;primer&quot; end times novel.  After you have a grip on how the end times could happen, it's informative to read other novels that have different perspectives. What no one else has reviewed but which really placed this novel high on my list was the epilogue illustrating the truth and soundness of the Bible through an overview of fulfilled prophecy. Even if you don't like the word play in the novel itself, the epilogue is fascinating and informative reading.  In fact, it was the reason that I began to read and research the Bible for myself and the rest, as they say, is history
