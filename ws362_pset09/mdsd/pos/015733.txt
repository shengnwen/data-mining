Buy this and High Court summaries keyed to your casebook and you're set.  I also used the Gilberts and Sum and Substance 1L tapes while commuting to school--the best preparation with the least effort.  
Property isn't the easiest 1L subject but you get the hang of it.  This book does help but it's not as easy going as Civ Pro, Ks or Torts, for instance.  Still, a great help considering the subject.
