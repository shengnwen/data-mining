An enjoyable book which offers a good insight into the LBO business and the workings of Wall Street during the 1980s. There are some serious amounts of money involved and some very amusing characters - It almost reads like a comedy when detailing the exploits and excess of the chairman of RJR Nabisco with his fleet of company jets and "superstar" cronies. 

Essentially, it reads like a thriller and although a little confusing (and perhaps too detailed on the history / background in parts), it is nevertheless a solid, enjoyable read and a 'keeper'. Recommended
