I have been a chronic pain patient for 10 years. I cried when I read the opening chapter of this book because someone FINALLY understood how I felt and what I was going through. This book has made a differnece in my life. I now understand the pain process and how my body handles it. I have learned strategies for coping and living a fuller life. This is the third copy of the book I have bought for a friend who needed it as well. Everyone who either suffers from chronic pain or has  someone close to them who does, needs to read this book
