I was raised on this book from the age of 3 up, and it never "terrified" me; it was fascinating and a little scary to think these things COULD happen, but overall the lessons from the book stayed with me FOREVER.  Stay well-groomed; eat your food; don't play with matches; don't suck your thumb...  All great lessons, beautifully illustrated and cleverly told
