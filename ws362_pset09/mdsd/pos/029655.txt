as a newly single 25 yr old in a quarter-life crisis with a dead end job, i found this book is at the very least comforting.  it's good to know that your 20s are meant to be hard.  but then again that's something everyone 30+ already tells me.  in any case, i really enjoyed this book because it covers EVERYTHING for a girl in her 20s.  the only problem i had was that the author continually relied on advice and comments from other 20 somethings.  how could someone in their 20s experiencing the same things i'm experiencing disburse thought-provoking, objective wisdom?  after all, that 23 year old named Mary from San Francisco probably won't follow her own advice to travel to Rwanda and fight genocide, but rather buckle under the societal pressure to be a 30 yr old wife and mother.
