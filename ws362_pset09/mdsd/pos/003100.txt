If you are looking for a self-help book, you may be disappointed. I tried to read this book several times over the period of the last six years in attempt to resolve conflicts in my relationships, and could not struggle too far until now, when I have some background knowledge of relationships and look not for problem-solving recipies, but for more general understanding. 

I like the systematic and clear way in which the author presented the material. I also can't read this book without being ashamed of my own manipulative ways that it uncovers. On the other hand, I draw some consolation from seeing that my enemies are mostly people with lots of mental problems, which call more for helping them rather than taking revenge.

I have to point out that the book is a bit sketchy and somewhat heavy on psychoanalitic terms, which I do not always understand. This, however, only underlines the importance of this book, which has become so popular, even though, perhaps, was originally designed for quite a specialized audience
