Firstly, I love William Shatner, he is just someone I enjoy watching--he clearly takes a great deal of enjoyment from what he does also.  The same is true to this book, it is at times easy to see through the prose to perhaps other more personal moments, as it is hard to seperate Kirk from Shatner--and it makes interesting reading to ponder what Shatner is thinking and saying though his most famous character.

I was impressed, first and foremost at how well he utilized the other characters.  Chekov is given impressive amounts of page time, Spock and McCoy are well written and Scotty is the only member of the original crew who accompanies Kirk on his crazy mission (loyalty to the Enterprise afterall).  I agree with one of the other reviewers, that perhaps this was Shatner's olive branch to James Doohan.  The characters have several thoughtful conversations where Kirk admits to himself that he has often not listened to Scotty as he should have.

The plot isn't an end of the world one, its Kirk in the middle of an extreme midlife crisis, along with a good old dose of rivalry (an old Academy classmate of Kirk's who is now head of Starfleet).  I did find at times that I felt the book was a little too long and so skimmed someof the more descriptive scenes.

The book is very thoughtful, even though it does have some action moments too, but it ties in huge amounts of the Trek Universe (I'm guessing alot of this is the work of Shatner's helpmates).  It is also more thought provoking than most of the trek books out there.

I really enjoyed this book as of the original series books I have been reading so far this has some of the BEST characterizations I have seen. (I really was expecting alot more of Kirk in a blaze of glory but instead Kirk is a very well layered and human character, with very noticable flaws,more so than on film it seems
