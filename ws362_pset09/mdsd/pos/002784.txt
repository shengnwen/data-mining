In the 70s, I read Ken Dychtwald's book BODYMIND and learned early in my life just how amazingly connected our bodies are to what goes on inside our minds. What Hay presents in her book is a direct correlation between illness and where a person is mentally, emotionally, or spiritually. Her premise is that each illness has a root cause in self-limiting or negative thinking (From Hay's book: Gout stems from the need to dominate and impatience or anger. Stroke stems from a sense of giving up or resistance -- the idea of "I'd rather die than change.") Even accidents are no accident, according to her. This understanding of health is a challenge to anyone reading the book because Hay lets you know fairly gently that you are responsible for you ... and your health.

If you are a person who doesn't embrace personal responsibility ("My boss makes me mad," "It is my mom's fault I grew up this way," "If I could get that loan, my life would be just fine," "I AM NOT defensive!"), then this book will probably just make you angry. If you are a person who wants to explore deep within yourself for those life-changing root causes, then give this book a try. Just don't beat yourself up over sicknesses that affect you now and instead see if changing your thoughts can help you start the healing process. I personally don't give much credence to the oft-repeated verbal affirmations Hay recommends -- she has them for each illness -- but reading them once and comparing them to your current thought patterns can be revealing and helpful
