This book is a pleasant, amusing, readable way of addressing the major issues that confront one at midlife:  Am I living a life that accords with my values, ideals, and talents?  If not, what specifically needs to be changed so I can achieve this?  I found the &quot;unpacking&quot; metaphor especially appealing because (as an ardent traveler) I well know the real-life value of traveling light;  it was rather astonishing to me to discover how much of a pack rat I've been in other aspects of my life!  On the other hand, as a single person with many friends but no life partner (and no desire for one), I found that the authors' couple orientation rendered many of the exercises virtually useless for me.  I agree that love is an important part of a full, satisfying life, but defining love as marriage, or the equivalent, seems ridiculously confining!  Otherwise, the book is a pleasure to read, and most of the exercises gave me useful insights, so I recommend it with reservations
