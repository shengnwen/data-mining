This book took hold of me and I couldn't put it down. Although the subject matter may be a bit much, it is told with such class and style you can't help but dive into it.

We have a woman who lost her husband two years ago. Still dealing with that pain, Sarah drives by her "best friend's" son walking in the rain, late for school. She decides to stop and give him a ride. He says he has to use the restroom and runs to a port-a-potty. After a few minutes of waiting, Sarah discovers that Jordan has tried to take his own life. She rushes him to the ER. There they discover an abused young man. Sarah still has Jordan's backpack, full of discs documenting the sexual abuse. 

Her son Nate, whom she is having troubles with surprises her, and befriends Jordan. He is the one that suggests Jordan come live with their family while the trial is going on for Jordan's parents. 

What happens is heartbreaking but Sarah and the boys make it through. Read when you have time to finish it in one sitting
