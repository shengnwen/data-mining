This book truly is a &quot;Bedtime Engineering Book&quot;. While it is technical, the information is fascinating and presented extremely clearly and colorfully in a manner that is neither over my head nor insulting (all the while, keeping a sense of humor). As an engineer, I can vouch for the fact that this book is not watered-down as some &quot;basic&quot; books are. It starts with well-explained basics so that the equations and technical details it gives later become intuitive. A quality technical text that reads well. Overall, an excellent book
