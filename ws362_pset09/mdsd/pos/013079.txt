In 1864, George P. Marsh published an engaging treatise about the mechanisms by which civilizations create ecological disasters.  His most central thesis is that cutting down forests desrupts otherwise stable hydrological cycles, thereby causing erosion and eliminating habitats that once supported diverse multitudes of animals and plants.  But the book is vaste, creative and detailed.  An American from a town in Vermont, Marsh also lived in Turkey and Italy, and pursued numerous careers, as diplomat, lawyer, businessman, and professor.  His intense love of language and history merged with  direct obersvations here and abroad to generate a remarkable breadth of knowlegde and a strong desire to communicate.  In Man and Nature, Marsh is not only inspired, he is also happy to digress, particularly in the abundant footnotes.
