A very pretty and sensitive book about pregnancy and birth (does not deal with conception). It is told from a second person point of view, as though the child being read to was the infant. The author focuses on the feelings  of the mother while she was carrying her baby: what it felt like when the  infant kicked, how the infant was fed, etc. Includes good in utero  descriptions and drawings. Lacks multicultural drawings
