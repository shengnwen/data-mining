If you're managing a project outside of your cultural home country, this book is worthwhile reading, or at least skimming (as I did) to get ideas on how to work more effectively with your "foreign" partners. If nothing else, it'll remind you that for them, you're the foreign person. Also good to remember that even if you yourself immigrated, your cultural outlook is likely still from your country of birth, especially if you lived there through adulthood and first job.

The first half of the book covers different concepts (e.g. time, communication, life outlook) for a variety of countries. The second half is an encyclopedia of short chapters on different specific countries.

While being expert at working in another culture comes only with time, it's certainly worth reading parts of this book (the general chapters plus a specific country's chapter) before your first working meeting on a multi-cultural project
