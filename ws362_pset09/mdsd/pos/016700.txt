a Generous Orthodoxy is generous indeed.  This book is a great selection for those who would like to learn about a spiritual journey through someone else's breadth of experience.  The book is rather confessional, and witty to offset the serious strain throughout.  I think this book is a wonderful subject for any Bible study or book club...much to ponder and much to uncover.  The one thing the book tries to do is welcome everyone back to the table, grumbling or not, to partake of the bread of life in communion with one another.  Radical and refreshing
