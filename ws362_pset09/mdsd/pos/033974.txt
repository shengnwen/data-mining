I bought this beautifully illustrated book for a family friend while her mother was expecting. It was a huge hit! The pictures and text made for excellent conversation starters about what to expect from parents, her role as a big sister, safety tips and some great positive messages about the important jobs associated with being an older sibling. The accompanying CD was not quite as well received but made for a good one time listening activity.
The book ended up being packed in the hospital bag for the big day - a great sharing time for mom and daughter before the new addition arrived
