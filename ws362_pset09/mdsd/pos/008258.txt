I thought this book and the author did a good job addressing the fundamentals of running a Recording facility, from simple explanations about contract agreements to how to potentially deal with different customer recording needs, I've glanced at other books on this topic and believe me, I literally fell asleep in the bookstore, this is a one of a kind on the subject, like my other reviews, I like to keep things simple to understand and to the point, keep this book nearby while you take a nap in your studio, because when you wake up, you'll fell better about conducting business and better understanding your client's recording needs. GOOD WORK TOM IN KEEPING IT SIMPLE !!!
