This is the 5th book by Ted Dekker that I have read. As with all of his other offerings that I have read (The Circle Trilogy & Three), he draws you in quickly and takes you from past to present and back again without pity. Just as I thought I had the whole story figured out, in true Ted Dekker fashion, the plot would take a 90 degree turn. You cannot predict a Ted Dekker ending, but hold on tight and enjoy the ride. 

The story follows a young Jewish man and his quest to find his birthright, left for him by his mother who he never met because they were separated due to a concentration camp in Germany during WWII. The man will go to any length to claim what he believes is his and finds himself in the process. A truly eye-opening read. 

EXCELLENT
