This book is not quite as good as WHITE OLEANDER yet it is still very compelling and at times even brilliant.  The novel is an easy diverting read  and much better written than the usual bestsellers found at airport newsstands.  Fitch does a particularly convincing job of recreating young artistic LA in the early 1980's or at least her version convinced me.  Josie is a compelling heroine but I found it a little offensive that Fitch herself seems to look down her nose at Josie's blue collar Bakersfield (heaven forbid one set of grandparents were Okies!) roots.  Minor characters as well as Josie are well realized but Michael and his parents seem to be stock stereotypes of rich artistic men and women.
