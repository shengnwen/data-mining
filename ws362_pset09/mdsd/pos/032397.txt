I picked up this book and read it within a day. It is very informative about ADHD and gives excellent information that is very well presented to parents. I really liked Monastra's approach to diagnosing ADHD. If you have been told that your child may have attention problems, then you must read this book! It is also excellent for anyone who works with ADHD kids so that they will understand what ADHD is and how kids with ADHD are affected by the disease. When my pediatrican diagnosed my child with ADHD, I wish she would have handed me a copy of this book. I would have been better informed at an earlier stage of the game.
