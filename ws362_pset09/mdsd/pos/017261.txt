I have read several of Patrick Rice's books. He is awesome. His books are very educational, and well writen. The way he writes it makes it easy to understand. 

His work is the best. I personally love his infrared work best. He is truly inspiring to the rest of us Professional Photographers.

I have had the great pleasure of sitting in on one of his classes. GREAT!!! 

I highly suggest you read this book if you are interested in infrared and wedding photography. Then I suggest you read several of his other books. 
Especially his new book, Master Guide. You will learn ALOT
