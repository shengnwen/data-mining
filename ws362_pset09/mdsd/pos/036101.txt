Unlike many coffee related books, this one goes a lot further.  This book approaches coffee with a scientific approach, not a descriptive approach, which makes it harsher to read, but which provides info unavailable elsewhere.  

By no means should this book be considered as your first coffee related book.  Cover coffee basics through other more appropriate books.  Once you've read a couple, if you really want to go deeper into the knowledge of coffee, this this book is for you.  It requires that you have a scientific background though.  You will see some chemistry formulas and it does discuss kinetic energy; it's somewhat technical.

I would give it a perfect 5 star rating, but I feel that some information in this book lacks relevance.  In purchasing this book, I wanted to understand the science behind coffee to help me make better coffee.  I felt that many passages of this book were irrelevant towards that goal.

Hope this helps
