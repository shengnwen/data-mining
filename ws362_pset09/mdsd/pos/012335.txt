Invention by design is a complex book written about simple everyday things we use. Things like paper clips, aluminum cans, mechanical pencils, zippers, airplanes, bridges, and more. The Author, Henry Petroski did a very good job on writing about all of these objects. The book goes on to explain the nature of the design, engineering, and concepts put behind the objects.

Pros: Very Interesting
      Good information
      Very Descriptive
      Ideas and concepts never thought of to be use in the
       everyday items.

Cons: Very Slow and Drawn out.
      At times can be a bit boring

Overall Review: A- book. Many good facts and alot of useful
                information. A tiny bit slow, but overall, a good
                read.

Recommendations: I would recommend this book to a friend who may
                 be interested in any basic form of Engineering,
                 like myself
