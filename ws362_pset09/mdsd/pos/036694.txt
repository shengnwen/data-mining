There is some valuable information on how to invest your money wisely, and gives you a few options whether you are conservative, moderate, or a risk-taker.  Basically the book suggests not to go extreme with risk taking unless you really like doing it and have extra money to possibly blow off or hit really big.  The big key is patience, and it explains why eventually.  What was prickly about this book was how especially at the beginning, it tells stories of how it was "so obvious" that certain stocks would plummet and how ideas just didn't make sense.  I don't think anything is so obvious as he makes it seem such as stock for a movie internet database not working out because casting directors would not want more candidates to choose from than they already do.  The reasoning is too simplified.  For instance, maybe the website gave details and what actors have done in the past etc.  The idea is just like imdb (Internet Movie Database), except that imdb is still going and I do not think it's based on stocks, but rather advertising, subscribers, and to a point, viewers.

In fact, he even describes a bit of drivel thrown into the book on this page, showing that it's not so easy to write a prefectly written book:

p. 269 comment: If you kill off the stocks that didn't survive, of course whatever's left over will have a higher average unless all the stocks are zero or negative to begin with.  Doesn't seem like a useful chart.

This book keeps its information updated on solid investment strategies toward the end mostly.  If you don't like to be delved into the world of finance, but still want something a little bit different, but probably reliable for some good advice, this book is worth a read.
