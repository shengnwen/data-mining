As an Historian, I found Ms. Power's book to be enlightening.  She has managed to capture the true day-to-day existence of women in this time period, without falling into the mire of Courtly Love.  Her use of records  is inovative as are the truths she draws from the records.  All in all one  of the better books written on the subject
