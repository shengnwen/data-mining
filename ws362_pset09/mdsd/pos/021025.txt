A well-organized book that does a very good job of detailing what there is to see and do on the major  islands of Hawaii. Especially useful are the cross-reference notes found within the margins, and various &quot;favorite&quot; lists found within each section. Greg never steered us  wrong. Also, an excellent reference for those who wish to camp or hike
