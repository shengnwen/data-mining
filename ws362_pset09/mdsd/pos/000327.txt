Stephanie Plum is a laugh out loud bounty hunter that is very reminescent of Barnie Fyfe in The Andy Griffin Show. She has the worst luck with cars, yet the best luck in stumbling across trouble. This time she is on the hunt for the owner of a candy store who everyone thinks is the sweetest, nicest guy around and that Stephanie is a terrible person for even attempting to bring him in on a silly charge like carrying concealed, which in Trenton, New Jersey seems to be a common thing. It isn't until bodies start showing up that Stephanie realizes something more is going on. 

This particular novel is where the humor that is so commonly associated with Janet Evanovich starts to really take place as well as the on going flirtation for Joe Morelli-the cop, and Ranger-the bounty hunter. The plot gets good from here on out. 

Is it worth buying? 
After reading one and two, I rushed out to get every one of the books in the series. I was not disappointed in the least. It is a fun read. Don't expect heavy drama in this series though. The Stephanie Plum books are strictly for light reading. Each book leaves you wanting to read more.
