What can I say? It's the absolute best, must have book for ANYONE who has even a slight interest in Astrology. I've been an Astrology enthusiast for over 10 years now and even though my level is more in the intermediate to advanced range, I still find this as an invaluable, handy reference. It perfectly "walks" you through this fascinating, yet complex science in a simple and easy to understand format. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to go beyond those fun, yet very general and vague daily horoscopes you find in the paper. It even includes a mail in offer to get your own chart done! (At least my old copy does, not sure about the new edition)
This book will help you understand and interpret your chart to give you an enlightening and informative understanding of yourself. 
It includes chapters that explain and interpret the meanings of all the twelve houses, the signs and their characteristics, the planets and their rulerships, even meanings to all possible aspects of your natal placements. 
I really wish I had this book when I first developed an in-depth interest in Astrology. Again, A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ASTROLOGY ENTHUSIAST!!
