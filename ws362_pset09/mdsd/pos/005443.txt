I never really thought about angels much until my fiance told me about his reocuuring dream that he has had since he was 7 about fighting Satan with Arcangle Micheal watching over him or sometimes helping him.  I thought it was strange, so I bought this book for further insight.  It was pretty helpful and I just never realized how many different types of angels there are.  I now feel that my fiance maybe does have an Arcangle watching out for him :)  And it seems everyone has some angels watching out for them, except if you are a dark entity.  Sylvia doesn't believe in Satan, but my fiance does, but that's okay.  You don't have to agree with Sylvia 100%, she's been known to make a mistake here in there in her lifetime
