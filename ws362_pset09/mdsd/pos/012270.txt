Max Brooks gives us the Zombie Survival Guide, written in a viewpoint of seriousness. It's not laugh-out-loud funny but is quite humorous in its seriousness. Brooks does a fine job of covering the bases. We get the finer basic points of survival in a zombie outbreak. Chapters cover zombie origins, alongside the Stages or levels of contagion of a zombie epidemic (Stages 1 thru 4, with Stage 4 being zombie overrun world). You learn what to do when running away from zombies, including what types of terrain to use and avoid, what equipment you'll need, transportation, what to avoid, and where to go. Next is your basic arsenal advisory on what to use and what to avoid given a rundown on pros/cons of a variety of weapons. Next is your defense vs a zombie force whether it's a secluded fortress or house setup beforehand or if where to hole up while on the run. Be sure to avoid police & fire stations, shopping malls, grocery stores, and hospitals. Second storey house are better if you go upstairs and destroy the staircase even prisons are preferred for a good solid base of operations. Following this is the offense groups can take once a base has been setup. Rounding it out is where to go and what to do when the Stage 4 zombies-takeover-world happens. Concluding the book is the history of zombie infestation and outbreaks. These are great and well thought out and some great short stories could be written off these 'occurances'. After reading this, you'll end up picking up Brooks other book "World War Z".

Overall, entertaining and Brooks provides us with a great 'survival guide'. Be prepared, be alert, be safe
