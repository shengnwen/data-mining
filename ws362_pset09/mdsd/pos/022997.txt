I try to read as much about history as possible.  People who are fighting or have fought in wars are our loved ones and ancestors.  This book is not pretty - but it is not meant to be.  It is a book based on one man's journey in life and Auschwitz.  I would recommend it to anyone.  We need to know the history of our land and people.
