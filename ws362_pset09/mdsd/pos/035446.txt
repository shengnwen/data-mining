Being a guy, I wasn't raised reading romance books. After reading my first Nora Roberts book I was hooked. Nora has such a range in her books that there is something for everyone. This is one of her best. I started this book on the morning of a day off from work. After putting it down once to eat, I had it done by mid afternoon. The plot is intense, the characters are easy to get connected to. This would make a great movie. Nora...make this a trilogy please. Don't miss this one
