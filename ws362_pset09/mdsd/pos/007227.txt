I'm probably the only person in the world who hadn't read a Stephen King novel, and am so glad that I started with this one which is a writing gem. Dolores Claiborne is a plain woman who has had to work hard all of her life to support herself, her three children and her violent, lazy, drunken sot of a husband.The entire book is Dolores' narrative to the police chief and a police stenographer, with only her words being recorded. She had worked as housekeeper to a wealthy old woman, a recluse who became more and more difficult as she aged, so Dolores' work and caring for her children was her entire world. I found this slim book to be a marvel of pithy condensation, without a wasted word and well able to tell a life story of great drama and to hold the reader's attention for a good one day read
