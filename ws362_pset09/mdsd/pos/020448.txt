This play is an unusually clever and perceptive study of the nature of human memory and the ambiguity of human communication, touches on the social responsibility of scientists, and explores the nature of knowledge in general.  Frayn centers the play around the 1941 visit of Werner Heisenberg, then Professor of Physics at Leipzig and head of the German effort to develop nuclear weapons, and his former mentor, the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr.  What happened during that visit remains unknown, though there is apparently documentation about the visit in the Bohr archives that will be released someday in the future.  Did Heisenberg ask or want to ask Bohr about joining the German war effort?  Did he want to enlist Bohr's help in derailing everyone's efforts to develop nuclear weapons?  What did Bohr say?  What were the consequences of the visit?  Did Heisenberg deliberately impede the German effort to develop nuclear weapons?  There are no answers to these interesting questions and probably never will be.  Frayn's brilliant conceit is to structure the play, which contains only three characters - Heisenberg, Bohr, and Bohr's wife, in form that mimics many aspects of quantum physics.  Heisenberg's and Bohr's movements and verbal encounters mirror particle interactions, the whole play is permeated by the metaphor of uncertainty, and quantum entanglment is an implicit metaphor for the relationship of Heisenberg and Bohr.  The play is only 2 acts but is intellectually rich and repays careful reading.  It would be easy to use the scientific metaphors in a superficial manner but Frayn has done an excellent job of integrating science and history.  A nice addition is a thorough afterward by Frayn in which he discusses the history and historical literature on Heisenberg's visit to Bohr and the Heisenberg's role in the German nuclear weapons program
