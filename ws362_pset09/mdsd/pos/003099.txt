This is a great cookbook!  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is becaus the cookbook is bound in a regular book format so it is very difficult to place on the counter top or in a recipe hook holder when you cook.  The original version was spiral bound which was great!  All cookbooks should come spiral bound!!!  My two primary cookbooks in the kitchen are this one and More With Less (which incidently is actually spiral bound)
