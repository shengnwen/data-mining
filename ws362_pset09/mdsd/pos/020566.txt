This book is really good I'm a middle-schooler and this book helps me understand why theese girls do the things they do. now i know that i can beat their tricks knowing that their doing it to be popular and i understand that theese girls are not at all perfect, in fact they have more problems then we think. now i know that i am stronger then the bully and that i can outsmart them and shrug off what they say. i love this book
