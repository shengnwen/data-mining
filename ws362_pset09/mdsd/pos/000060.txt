Lord of the Flies is a literary classic written by William Golding in 1954. Although it's been 50 years, his story remains timeless. It deals with the pure essence of what it is to be human, and how it is to loose that humanity. The event begins as a group of boys find themselves alone on a deserted island after a severe plane crash; they are quickly drawn toguether by a conch blown by Ralph. Since the very beggining of the book a conflict of interest is noted between Ralph, the leader; and Jack, the hunter. This conflict does nothing but expand and broaden, until finally all hell breaks loose. Lord of the Flies is more than a story, it's a walking breathing epic of symbolism, as colourfull, lively and destructive as the human race itself.
