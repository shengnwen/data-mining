I first discovered the "Tales of the City" series over the summer.  I purchased the ombious of the first three books.

I have been looking for a long time for a series of books that fit into the mold that Armistead Maupin has used for his book series.  He uses the books to tell tales of people who have all sorts of different sexual identities and how they live (and play) in a world where they are accpeted everywhere.  

Back in the 70's this had to be a groundbreaking book, and I am glad that I was given to the chance to meet Mary Ann, Mouse, Mona, Brian, Madame Madrigal, Jon, DeDe, and D'or so many years after there adventures where first told
