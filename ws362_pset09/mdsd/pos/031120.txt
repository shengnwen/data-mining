This is an interesting and colorful book with excellent photos. Each two page spread has five items of the color and a cut out circle showing part of an item with a question. For example, the red page shows cherries, dress, car, fish, drum, and the question by the cutout is "This helps to put out fires. What is it?" Lifting the flap shows a fire truck. The photos are excellent and the book design adds interest. The 2005 edition is an improved redesign of an earlier edition. Karen Woodworth Roma
