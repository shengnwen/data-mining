Clarke's book provides very clear analysis of the purpose and nature of ancient Roman erotica.  He uses a wide range of sources--literature, instructive manuals, precedent in Greek and Roman art, setting, etc.--to back up his arguments, which he presents in a lucid style that is as pleasurable to read as it is easy to follow.  I particularly recommend the chapter on erotic art in public locations in Pompeii
