I read this book to get more background on The Factory. I suggest that you do not buy this if you are looking for a book with background. You have to know a bit about The Factory to understand what's going on. I really enjoyed this though, and I found it very intriguing. This is the book that really got me very interested in the Factory. I highly recommend this. I am withholding one star because it was a bit confusing, with many gaps the reader had to have previous knowledge to fill in. It was insanely interesting, however
