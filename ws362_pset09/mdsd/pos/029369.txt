 
There is a scene near the end of The Hot Kid where Jack (a criminal wannabe who longs to be American's most wanted) is planning to shoot one of his partners (he ends up killing most of his friends at some point in the novel).  The two men are sitting around a campfire roasting a chicken while Jack considers the best possible angle to shoot the other man, not wanting the chicken to fall into the fire.  

There is an absurdity to scenes like this that capture the essence of Elmore Leonard.   Needless to say, I'm a big fan and The Hot Kid is among Leonard's best.  

The novel is set during prohibition; when gangsters and law men were celebrities.  The novel follows the rise of the new hot kid with the Marshal's service (Carl) and a spoiled rich kid (Jack) who wants to be a famous bank robber.  Jack's ill-conceived schemes provide much of the humour in the novel.   Leonard's characteristic lean prose and sharp dialogue are back in full form (although, because the novel is set in the 1930's there is considerably less swearing than one might normally expect from Leonard).

This is a great read.  Gun molls, bank robbers, and a healthy dose of bravado... 

...need I say more?
