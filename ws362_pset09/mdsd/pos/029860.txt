Darius James' &quot;That's Blaxploitation!&quot; gives a decent account of  the genre of American film that dominated the Black Box-Office in the  1970's; however, it doesn't reach the depths of what caused the rise of  such films.  It's humor is raw and raucus, but his obvious personal biases  get in the way
