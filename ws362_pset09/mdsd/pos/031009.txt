I felt a bit guilty the entire time I was reading this book, which has considerable literary merit but REALLY dishes the dirt. Although Sean writes with considerable wit and humor, there's a vindictiveness underlying this work that you don't often find in literary memoirs.  And I couldn't quite get over the timing of its publication, which pretty much coincided with the Grand Opening of the new (and spectacular) home of the De Young Museum in San Francisco, which Sean's evil step-mother Dede Wilsey had spearheaded.  But, oh, the pleasure of seeing the very rich skewered in that way!  And, (as I had to keep telling myself throughout the book), given the great reviews by respected critics, it's okay to read and enjoy it, right?  Because it is the self-exploration -- and not the gossip -- that keeps those pages turning . . . right?
