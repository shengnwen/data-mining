Interval Training (IT) is systemic conditioning based on low intensity activity punctuated with bursts of high intensity activity.  IT has an advantage over "aerobics" done at constant pace because the high intensity phase triggers growth hormone and other effects that are never quite achieved by extended low intensity training.  This means that you can achieve benefits beyond those of aerobic training for athletes and also for weight control and general fitness.  IT does not neccessarily replace low intensity training entirely, nor does it replace more specialized strength or flexibility work where needed.  It is a concept with its own niche in physical training. 

This book introduces the concept of IT and gives examples of how to set up a conditioning program for yourself with IT at the core.  There is a lot of practical advice here for the novice and for those who have only a passing knowledge of physical conditioning.  Those with moderate knowledge of conditioning including interval techniques will find most of this to be review or variations of ideas they alreay use.  Trainers and those who use formal interval techniques already will probably not get much out of this, and should instead look to more advanced, more technical, or more specialized books.
