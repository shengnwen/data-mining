Based on the thought that &quot;life is state of consciousness,&quot; this book is about comprehending the mind of man, so that nothing would be impossible and as such it is a good overview of metaphysics, dealing with questions of consciousness, reincarnation, health, wealth, protection and many more. Large sections are written in a question-and-answer format for easier understanding. There is a table on how the body reflects the mind, explaining how certain subconscious patterns may manifests as certain dis-eases and a section on manifesting prosperity that is also found in the author's &quot;Abundance Book.&quot; Superbeings is very readable and full of common sense
