Originally published in 1915 this anthology is a series of free verse monologues written from the perspective of the deceased inhabitants of Spoon River. Most of the monologues are from rather pathetic people who were either wronged by others or who wronged others. The book concludes with "The Spooniad" which gives something of a story summary of the events that you have been reading about from the perspective of the various characters.

My favourite part is comparing the monologues of the various parties involved in the disputes. This can be quite funny at times to see the irony of their lives from the perspective of death. The monologues are also quite philosophical at times and I conclude with
Griffy the Cooper
The cooper should know about tubs.
But I learned about life as well,
And you who loiter around these graves
Think you know life.
You think your eye sweeps about a wide horizon, perhaps,
In truth you are only looking around the interior of your tub.
You cannot lift yourself to its rim
And see the outer world of things,
And at the same time see yourself.
You are submerged in the tub of yourself-
Taboos and rules and appearances,
Are the staves of your tub.
Break them and dispel the witchcraft
Of thinking your tub is life!
And that you know life
