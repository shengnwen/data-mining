I'm actually nearly 30, but I don't have an Amazon account so disregard the "kid" title. Before I read Matthiessen's work, I was a very very devout christian. I lived the "truth" as I believed it to be. I led a christian youth group at my high school, I was a member of a christian rock band and I was eagerly anticipating my mission trip to New Guinea, until I read At Play In the Fields of the Lord.

A small group of American protestant missionaries venture into a dangerous and deep section of the Amazon rainforest to succeed where their Catholic rivals failed, who were killed by the people they were trying to convert. The result is a clash of civilizations and ideals, between the missionaries and the indians and even between the missionaries themselves and the indian tribe as well. The end result was one of the most sobering things I've ever read in my life.

My question is, why? Why do we westerners feel the need to travel far beyond the reaches of our own nations to selfishly and arrogantly proselytize people who's only crime is being too geographically removed from the Middle East to know of a person we revere as a god? Why does it have to be this way? Why can't we just respect another's way of life? In all good conscience, I could not be a missionary after reading this book. If anything, it strengthened my love toward my fellow man and woman more than my church did because it taught me to live and let live.

I urge others with similar dilemmas to explore this book. Its not pretty, but the truth must be told
