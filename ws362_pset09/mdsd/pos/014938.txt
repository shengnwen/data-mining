I am very disappointed that this is the last of a captivating series. Rag and Bone is a wonderful book. It is powerful, emotionally charged, riveting and deeply touching. I am glad that there is a silver lining for Rios. However why must Mr Nava ends there. I hope he will change his mind and continue to develop his amazing protagonist's life
