I am not ashamed to admit that I am 28-going-on-29 and I absolutely love this book.  It is very well written and highly detailed.  As a Mehanical Engineer with 6+ years work experience I was certain that this book wouldn't live up to the expectations that the first few pages that I read in the book store led me to develop.  Was I wrong!!  This book's simplified expanation of engineering concepts is unmatched.  From Lego block geometry to gearing setup and programming.  This book has it all if you'd like to go beyond the few missions that the mindstorm kit comes with.  Don't be mistaken this book has no step-by-step instructions for building robots.  It only introduces &quot;snippet&quot; to get your creative &quot;juices&quot; flowing.  My understanding of Legos and their use has been greatly enhanced.  To make things even better, the authors includes useful information on other Lego parts that are not included with mindstorm that are very important, i.e. light sensors, hydraulics, etc.  If you are looking for a reference book to help you build better Lego creations, this book is it!
