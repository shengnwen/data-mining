This is the follow up volume to the excellent Writing Down the Bones. If you have read the first book, and still feel blocked, then this book could prove very useful. What I feel is that she covered most of the important aspects of being an aspiring writer in 'Bones, so I feel their is some rehash, and some material that is just not as good as 'Bones.
Still, she builds more on both zen and jewish wisdom, and it does not do anyone any harm to read it. 
Of course, this book helped me to appreciate haiku, and that counts for something
