What a great book!  It's a shame that amazon doesn't have it in.  However, if you're missing this one, you can go to gooseberrypatch.com and they have this one online.  Plus, they have it in hardback too, which I prefer.  Try oxmoorhouse.com too - they may have it as well.  The more you order, the more you save! Anyway, this is such a great book and is basically a continuation of the fabulous recipes that are in book three.  I use these recipes throughout the year and I just can't tell you how wonderful they are! My husband doesn't like it when I give these as gifts because he wants everyone to think I'm a gourmet cook!  You won't be disappointed with these books - the decorating ideas are fabulous as are the gift projects.  These make awesome gifts too
