I've read and enjoyed many of Michael Connelly's mysteries and this is another good read, however it is not one of his best works.

FBI Agent Terry Caleb, now retired, after giving his heart to the FBI (literally and metaphorically) is taking time out to recuperate and restore his boat when he is approached by Graciela Rivers to investigate the death of her sister. Initially reluctant, Caleb can not resist finding the murderer whose actions resulted in Caleb receiving his new heart.

The title comes from Caleb's description of studying murder scenes and profiling killers. Haunted by past unsolved crimes he faces many obstacles in his search for the killer. No longer an official investigator, he has to work as an outsider to solve a crime which now appears to be the work of a psychopathic serial killer (aren't they all?). His search is further complicated by his attraction to Graciela Rivers and the increasing suspicion of the police that Caleb had a motivation to commit the murder.  

The book ends with a twist, revealing that the killer is linked to past cases that Caleb worked in his time with the FBI, and a showdown with the killer - I'm not saying what happens but I found it unrealistic!
