Recreating the culture and times here is a big part of McCullough's success in writing this great book.  Earlier histories emphasized the Roeblings' interactions and obsessions, with great drama and effect.  While McCollough plays that card here, too, the book places the reader into the times much more effectively.  Yes, it's still about the father and son, but the people who contributed and benefitted play as great a role here.

Very satisfying read - enjoy it
