There will never be a chef like this one! His Jamin restaurant in Paris was a masterpiece. His food second to none. The book is good but occasionally some of Patricia Wells lack of experince comments come through. (she has no professional culinary training) Some ingredients, seafood , we cannot get here in the US so why give us the recipes???? None the less, this is a good book
