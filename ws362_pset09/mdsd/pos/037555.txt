Well known for his radio show, Hank Hanegraaff (the bible answer man) puts together an easily referenced compilation of frequently asked questions from the many years on radio and from venues around the world.  He recommends further resources to compliment this handbook.  Each question and answer is fortified with specific scripture passages.  Well written, with straight forward answers.  

This book is to equip us to "always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks"

Wish you well
Scot
