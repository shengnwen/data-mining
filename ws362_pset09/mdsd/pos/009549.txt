The Andromeda Strain is a story about a virus that was exposed to a small town in Arizona, Piedmont.  Piedmont was a desolate ton to begin with, and only got worse after a strange and unknown virus took the lives of all the citizens, save two.  This is when the story begins to get juicy.  These two survivors, a small child and an old man, are then transferred to a maximum security laboratory in Nevada.  From here a team of scientists work toward investigating the virus.  
	As I was reading I often became confused and sidetracked, in particular in the beginning, when Michael Crichton explained the background information on the team of scientists.  That section was not especially necessary and somewhat useless.  However, quickly I came to find that the book would take a turn for the best when the plot became exciting and interesting.  The story in roughly the fifth and sixth chapters became interesting when the team of scientists were sent to work on the case in Nevada.  If I were to recommend this novel, I would recommend this book to science fiction fanatics and people interested in a virology or bacteriology field.   I, personally am not much of a science person but I too was entertained and enthralled all the way throughout.  I wouldn't change much except the scientific terminology.  Overall, I felt the book was very good and it maintained my attention throughout the entire book.
