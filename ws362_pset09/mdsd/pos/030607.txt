This book provides a great survey of Luther's major writings. This book is best read in a class setting, as every piece has a very particular context. Many of the pieces are Luther's direct response to the occurences around  him. The book makes the most sense when one has access to Luther's  historical and social situation, which can be found in books like Luther:  Man Between God and the Devil, written by Heiko Oberman
