If you want more a straight documentary history of Joan's life then read Pernod's Her Story. Marina Warner's book--and this is probably the reason why the other reviewers do not like it--is more an analysis of the evidence that may be demanding for the lay reader. I would still consider it, by far, the best biography of Jeanne d'Arc, which is demonstrated by this reprinting. If someone were to ask me which single book on Joan's life, of all the 100s that one has access to today, should one read to gain some background of her life and significance, I would recommend this one without hesitation
