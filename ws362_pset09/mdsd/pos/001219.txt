This is one of my favorite Anna Pigeon novels.  She is a ranger in Guadeloupe Mountains National Park and comes across the body of a ranger who has apparently been killed by a cougar (hence the name of the book).  She is convinced that the lion has been wrongfully accused of murder, and this conviction grows stronger as more dead bodies appear.  Since an autopsy of the ranger shows that she was killed by the cougar, you know from the start that Barr has come up with an good setup for a murder mystery, with a novel choice of weapon.

Ranger Anna Pigeon is an interesting character, with a backstory (she is a widow who escapes New York by becoming a ranger), a long-distance relationship with her psychiatrist sister (a plot device that serves well to reveal inner thoughts), and a vice (alcoholism).  She's cynical and worldly, but that is balanced by her love of nature and the parks.  She's also a bit of a superhero, especially at the end, and I don't find those parts too convincing.  

The book conveys a great sense of the setting.  Barr loves the desert parks, including the site of this novel, Guadeloupe Mountains (in West Texas).  This is a relatively unknown park, which includes the high point of Texas.  Ranger Pigeon spends a lot of time in the backcountry of the park and makes it sound inviting even though there are no water sources there.

The book has a well-constructed plot though the ending lacks a full resolution.  As is generally true in this series, it's easier to make good guesses about whodunnit than it is to figure out the motive.  Some motives are so oddball, "out of the box," that I don't see how you could figure it out from the information given, and that's a violation of the mystery writers' code.  Barr *almost* commits that sin here.

Overall, this is a good introduction to the series.  If you don't like this one, don't read any of the others.
