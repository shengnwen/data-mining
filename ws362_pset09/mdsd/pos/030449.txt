a very nice page turner with more than enough depth,detail
and suspense to make you genuinely eager to see what happens next.Mr Flynn's protagonist,master CIA operative
Mitch Rapp,is unflinchingly noble even while he performs
his primary fuction as an assassin.
The characters,a pretty standard mix of opportunistic politicians and pragmatic behind the scenes players are
presented with very through detail--more than enough to
keep us interested in what happens to them.
If you enjoy a good,cynical political thriller--you will enjoy this
one.
