I am an Executive Search Consultant, a Headhunter, and I found this book to be a simple and useful checklist, especially for more senior hires. It is so easy to forget that the competition out there really is very high for jobs, and the more senior you are, the more you have to make sure your career management strategy is a very deliberatly executed and well thought out one. No one has time to read verbose books, so this one is light, and easy to remember and to refer to later.
I admit that it covers the basics, but if you get those right, then you have a strong foundation on which to build. The book is a good start
