I really enjoyed this book because of its fast pace and very involved plot.  Philip Marlowe is really at his best here.  By the end he has been beaten, manipulated, and framed for murder but manages to solve the mystery and come out as clean as a fat man's plate.  One major element of the plot was a bit obvious however, namley the identity of the lady in the lake.  There was still much to be revealed and discovered.  This may be my favorite of the Marlowe series thus far.  They are all great, so that is saying something
