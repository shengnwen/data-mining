The Thorn Birds is one of my favorite novels. It is a story that reflects the wild nature of life, the unruly heart, and determination of spirit. An eventful story that continues to surprise with its vast range of emotions and depth. The minute you finish it, you will want to turn back to the first page and begin again!
