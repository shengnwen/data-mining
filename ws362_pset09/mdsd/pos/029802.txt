Broadway actress, Tony Award Winner, accomplished voice performer, Judy Kaye's accomplishment are many. Add to that list her thoughtful reading of this story of an 11-year-old girl trying her best to keep her life together in the turbulent sixties. 

While many moms baked cookies, shepherded school field trips, Eleanor Roosevelt Dingman's mother most definitely did not. That was really low down on the agenda for this mom who has taken the name of Doris Day Dingman and longs to be a star. This dream is awfully hard on Ellie as she realizes that Mom (who insists she be called Doris not mom) is actually rather showy, in fact, cheap. The kids at school taunt Ellie, and there are times when she thinks they're right. Solace is found with Holly, her best friend and neighbor. 

Since Doris is most often away from home pursuing her hopes of fame and fortune and Dad works very long hours, much is left for Ellie to look after. Too much for a girl her age. Eventually, Doris really makes a break and runs away to New York City. Is she discovered by a talent scout? No, she's discovered behind the counter of a rather dingy department store. 

Throughout the upheaval in her family Ellie learns one of life's important lessons. Ms. Martin has again painted a poignant picture of growing up.
