Set in nineteenth-century England, Silas Marner is a weaver who has moved to a new town, Raveloe.  Repulsed by his appearance and cataleptic fits, he is ostracized by the community.  After losing his faith and having his fortune stolen from him, his fortunes change over time.  

The fascinating subject is not Marner but the town, Raveloe, whose characters are of particular interest.  It is interesting how Eliot spends more time discussing their thoughts and actions than the does Marner, the title character.  

I was interested in this book from reading Middlemarch and found Marner to be decidedly more entertaining, but not as in-depth.  Yet there are important themes found in Marner--the loss of faith, the good of the community vs. the rights of the individual, and the importance of social class (this is present in every British novel).  

Marner is a masterpiece because it is written by a woman in the nineteenth century and one of George Eliot's great works.  It is also an entertaining book to read, and not too difficult, seeing its short length.  Those interested in reading Eliot may want to start with this classic.
