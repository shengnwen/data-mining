I got this as a gift this year, and after Dangerfield's passing it meant a lot more to me reading it than I thought it would.

It's very simple to just pick up and read - it doesn't have long whiny prose or lengthy explanations of his life. Instead, Dangerfield fuses humor with the most saddest of stories, and you can't help but laugh.

This man is a comic genius, and this book proves it. A must read for anyone with a sense of humor
