My mom and I decided to spend a month driving all over Ireland.  We took this book and the "Ireland (Eyewitness Travel Guides)" book.  Both were very helpful.  I'm drawn in more by pictures which is rather limited in this book but I promise in the 4 weeks we drove down all sorts of bad roads and lanes, never once did we come across a landmark, area or town that wasn't mentioned in this book!  It was amazing.  

I can't judge the hotel ratings but we tried some of their restaurant suggestions and they were great too!  (In Kinsale, Co. Cork try The Blue Haven the pub features the same food as the restaurant.  The salmon & sticky toffee pudding are a must have!)
