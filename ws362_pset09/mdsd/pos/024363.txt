Stabin's book is aptly titled "Simple, Fast, and Focused". His book on watercolor has the perfect balance of visuals and text, each commenting on and highlighting the other. His style is ecclectic and will appeal to any taste, I think, and for a beginner or intermediate paiter, the book can help one make great strides in technique as well as artistic vision. Stabin's video, by the way, (on painting the lighthouse) is a wonderful compliment to the book
