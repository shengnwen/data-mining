I met Ed Webster on a field trip with my daughter's grade 5 class to DeLorme Map in Yarmouth, ME, home of Eartha, the world's largest rotating globe.  He held the class spellbound, especially when he told us of Everest.  I bought a copy of SNOW IN THE KINGDOM, and read it into the wee hours, which is saying a lot since I'm not ordinarily a night owl.  It was so exciting, I could hardly put it down!  But much more than the excitement, I especially appreciated Ed's sensitivity and respect toward peoples of other cultures, keen insight into human nature, and careful explanation of what life is like in the Himalayan regions.  Months later, I saw an Omni theater presentation entitled EVEREST at the Boston Museum of Science.  I could appreciate it so much more by knowing the names of the people and places from Ed's book.  Ed Webster has created a legacy in laboring over a decade on his fine book, for it will enrich the understanding of generations of people.  Allow yourself the privilege of being one of them (and visit Ed in person at DeLorme Map in Maine if you get the chance)
