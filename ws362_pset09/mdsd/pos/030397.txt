   The Red Pony starts out with a boy named Jody. Jody loves horses so his dad Billy Buck bought him a horse at an auction. The horse's name is Gabilan. Jody trains Gabilan and Gabilan starts to like Jody. One day Gabilan gets through the gates of the barn during a storm and gets sick. If you want to find out what happens next you have to read this book. The author of this book is John Steinbeck. Some of the characters in this book are Jody, Billy Buck, Gabilan, and more.
   The message of this story is to always fight for what you love. I think this because Jody always in the story fought for what he loved. Also the tone of this story is sad, and a little bit happy.
   The author did a very good job with the details. The reason why he did the details good is because he describes how people talk. John stienbeck  als did a good job with bringing new characters into the story, like when a native american goes to Jody's house.
   This book is a very good book. It is very suspesful in the beginning of it, but toward the end of it starts to get boring. If you like sad boks then you should read this book
