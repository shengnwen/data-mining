This is a brilliant intervention in the study of American literature written by one of the smartest, women academics out there.  Wonderful in its contextualization of 19th-century American women writers, this book is well-organized, comprehensive and lively.  Please don't be daunted by fact-checker wannabes.  This is great stuff, for both students and those who would like a women writers compendium on hand.
