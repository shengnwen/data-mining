I don't really post many reviews on here so I'm not completely sure if I'm allowed to flame the other reviewers, so I'll just give it a try and say that most of you are idiots that shouldn't have been reading a series as great as this in the first place, stick to something simpler like Lord of the Rings, or one of it's many obvious rip-offs if you can't handle complexity in a fantasy series. Now, it's honestly been years since I last read this, and I only looked on here because with my brother beginning to read the series my interest was once again rejuvenated and I decided I wanted to see what people thought of what may possibly be my favorite entry in the series. The great mystery of who Demandred is was one definite enticement with this installment, from the first section of the prologue where he first speaks with the Dark One in the Pit of Doom to the very last cryptic paragraph where the Dark One is seemingly pleased with whatever it was Demandred accomplished during the course of these 1000 pages. A mystery I'm sure no one will know the true answer to until the 12th book is released. I also really enjoyed the political aspect of this though most people oddly cite this as a negative aspect (which is the same thing people did with the Star Wars prequels). To me the politics really adds a lot more depth and makes it all feel all the more real. If there's one thing that can't be taken away from Jordan it's that the world he has created is unbelievably comprehensive and it's almost hard to believe one person came up with all this, and can keep track of all of it. And while The Fires of Heaven and The Shadow Rising had plenty more action than this (these are my two other favorites in the series, but before any of you assume I'm on that whole "the series starts to suck down the road" bandwagon I'll have you know the only entry I found boring was book 10 but I still thought it was necessary in the end), what this book builds up to, the eventual real payoff, is one of the goriest, most amazing battles ever written and I defy anyone to name me it's equal. But maybe it isn't so thrilling for some, personally I was a big horror fan before I got into fantasy, mostly reading Stephen King, so I really appreciate the horror elements sometimes thrown into Wheel of Time and I definitly appreciate and adore a climax that ends with a literal hill-sized pile of human body parts laying in the middle of the battlefield. Which, the introduction of Mazrim Taim and everything to do with the Asha'man and the Black Tower was great, Taim is one of my favorite characters to read about and for a good while I really thought he was Demandred (Book 9 really squashed that theory). This book also impressed me because it was the first (correct me if I'm wrong) to include instances where things the reader thought impossible became possible, changing the rules of that particular fictional world. The two biggest I can recall off the top of my head being Nynaeve actually undoing Logain's gentling and Rand being able to break free while (I can't remember the number of Aes Sedai required to do this but I'll guess 6 or 9) Aes Sedai had him shielded. When these two instances occured I nearly shat my pants, while some people might scoff at this with their cynical "it's a fantasy novel anything can happen" claptrap, for me I have so much invested in this made-up world, I believe so much of it, that it can at times be as amazing to hear these marvels as it is to hear that a real human being defied gravity, or cancer has been cured. Which this book kind of opened the door and there has been some other instances in the series like this, like the breath-taking finale for book 9 where Rand with the help of others, chiefly Nynaeve actually cleanses the male half of the source, talk about awesome. Anyways I only wish I remembered more off the top of my head that happened in this one, I get the idea if I go on too long I'll mistake something from another book for something from this book, so I'll stop now and just hope that this review goes to the top (I'm not completely sure how this site works but I hope it's newest review first) so I can break up all the negativity on the first page of this site because frankly, a book this good deserves much better and to anyone reading these negative reviews and getting the wrong thoughts in their heads, just keep in mind there's always gotta be someone out there who hates something, the difference is you don't see me posting non thorough reviews about the things I don't like, personally I just ignore their existence and let the people who enjoy it enjoy it, that's not to say there should be no dissenting views on any kind of work posted, but they ought to be from actual fans with some in depth points on what was wrong with it instead of short, obviously biased, piles of drivel that just call the book boring, complex and political, with no insight whatsoever.
