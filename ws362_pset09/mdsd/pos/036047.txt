Merrick is not Rice's best work, but it's certainly better than Memnoch the Devil and The Vampire Armand, which single-handedly managed to ruin two of her characters, in my opinion.  The book "Merrick" isn't solely about Merrick, one of the Mayfair witches; to a great deal, it is about David Talbot, and, to a lesser extent, Louis.  The book does a great job of bringing about some exciting and dramatic changes to a few of Rice's major characters, including Louis, Lestat, and Merrick.  The book is a crossover of sorts, but I can't say much of that because I have yet to read any of the Mayfair novels.  The novel describes the life of Merrick and her relationship with David Talbot, and the main plot of the book surrounds the desire of Louis to speak with the spirit of Claudia.  The book deals with more of the supernatural world and spirits than most of the other books in "the Chronicles of the Vampire" series.  All in all, it's a decent book, but certainly not as good as others, namely, "Vittorio, Pandora, The Vampire Lestat," to name a few
