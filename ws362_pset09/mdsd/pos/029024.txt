I am shocked at some of the bad reviews below....  I guess the book was set up well for me because I can see how someone just picking this up at random could find it quite boring.  I was suggested to read this from a friend who told me it was one of the best books she has ever read in her life, but yet one of the worst stories.  I love the book, though.  Jubal makes a great comment that really relates how I view "Stranger in a Strange Land"

"Anybody can see a pretty girl.  An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become.  A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl she used to be.  A great artist can look at an old woman, portray her exactly as she is... and force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be... more than that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo see that this lovely young girl is still alive, prisoned inside her ruined body.  He can make you feel the quiet, endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who ever grew older than eighteen in her heart... no matter what the merciless hours have done."

The story and plot itself is, honestly, a boring old woman compared to other stories "meant" to excite you.  I feel I see so many of the points behind the actual story itself, though.  If you really analyze this book as you read (which isn't hard because Heinlein does a great job of almost forcing you to think and relate), you will see so many relevancies to so many things.  Beyond that, the concept, if read and understood from start to finish, is quite genius.

Buy this book and be prepared.  This is a trip and a work of art.  You must treat is as a work of art and give it the attention it deserves.  The more attention you put into it, the more you will get out of it at the end.  Enjoy
