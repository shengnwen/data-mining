This is Shirley Jackson's hilarious account of her struggles raising an expanding family of children.  She is delightfully unsentimental in her account of family life, and any harassed parent will recognise the situations she finds herself in.  For instance, what parent hasn't suffered the anguish of trying to eat in a restaurant with young children, how well Shirely Jackson sums of the sheer horror of that situation, among many others.  I didn't think there could ever be a book about child-raising as funny as Jean Kerr's 'Please Don't Eat the Daisies' but this one runs it a very close second
