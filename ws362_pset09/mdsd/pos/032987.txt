the great quest to vanquish evil forever ends in this book, that i would consider dissapointing. Tolkein picked back up with putting too much detail into everything and ended it in an odd way. I was expecting for the dwarves to come out of the ground and the elves out of the woods and everyone would live together, but instead he made it more realistic, so it actually coule have happened because only men are left, but i guess that might be a good thing, a good change of pace that makes you think, and i enjoy those kinds of books. They have a massive war in this book, and Tolkein wrote it wonderfly,he showed just the right amount of detail in that part that you knew what was going on, but not too much so you were falling asleep in a war.  I would call this a 8.5 out of ten, good, but not as good as it could have been
