"Mankind has always had a yen to travel," Dave Barry writes in the introduction to his "Only Travel Guide You'll Ever Need." To make the journey a more comfortable one, he offers helpful tips such as "Never go outside the hotel," and "Never board a commercial aircraft if the pilot is wearing a tank top.  He also promises to say if a country is awful even if he has not technically been there.  He describes the advantages to traveling inside the U.S. which is that you are never far from American advantages like Chicken McNuggets and window-cup suction Garfield dolls.  But he also ventures to Europe, where he describes the joy of bribing nuns, working with a travel agent, choosing a car rental company, attempting to cross the language barrier (he includes a list of helpful foreign phrases), having fun with airport security (this was written before 9-11), traveling as a family, and hints for getting through customs.  He describes all 50 states (well sort of), as well as major European countries and their main attractions.  He also provides maps, which if not strictly accurate, are still amusing.
