Now, I have been reading quite a bit of Tess's books and I must say i found this one an ABSOLUTE enjoyment. 

the first chapter was such an attention grabber that it gave me the creaps that it facinates me to think how does she think up of these things!

Dr. Maura after getting back home from a tiring flight from paris gets shocked into the crowd and the police cars that were swarming in front of her house. not knowing what is going on she get out of the cab that she was at and approaches the sceen just to have everyone look at her like they seen a GHOST! and literally they have every reason to be. 
in front of her house, parked in a simple car was a woman who has been shot, she was the splitting image of dr. maura her self! making this book so interesting, it was hard to put it down. this suddenly was a personal call for dr. maura to find out who the woman was, why does she look like her so much, what does the mysterious woman do for a living, and who her real parents are! to the light romance she was having or felt like she was having, with a man/cop who known who the woman was, her sister. 

i can not express how happy i was to pick up this book, if i said anymore then i would be giving almost the whole book away. all i can say is that you will absolutely not know who the killer is until the very end! the way she ties all the murders together was ingenious! omg i almost gave out a spoiler. 

guys i highly recommend this book to read!
