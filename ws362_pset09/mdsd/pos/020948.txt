! The Wednesday Surprise !


Everything was dark and then all of a sudden

SUPRISE! If you like surprises I suggest you read this

book. This story takes place in a little girl, Anna's house.

The characters are Anna, Grandma, Dad, and Mom. Anna

and her grandma spent a long time on a surprise for

Anna's dad.  Everyone helps get ready for dad's surprise

party except Anna's dad. This book is a good book for

people who like surprises and cliff hangers! Donald Carrick

has very colorful paintings to help the reader know what is

going on in the story. The message of this story is when

you work hard you can make things happen! I think this

book is for people from 7-12 years old. So how about you
 
go snuggle up and plan a surprise for someone!
