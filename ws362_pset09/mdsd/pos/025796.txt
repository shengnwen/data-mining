Very well written. It connected a lot of dots for both my wife & myself, bringing better understanding about us as well as our dog friends. We've always believed that when you train your dog you also are training yourself. We have loved all of our 'friends' that have shared their lives with us & are just now beginning a new bond with our third Dalmatian puppy. Anyone that has had any experience around this breed knows the special Aura they wear & this book is a 'must read' for You.
                        Sincerely
                                  John Steen Sr
