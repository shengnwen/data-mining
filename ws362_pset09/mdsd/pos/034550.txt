It's not a very big book, but this slender volume packs a wallop by completely and easily explaining Ellis' Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy.  This cognitive therapy can be a powerful tool for counselors or for individuals to use on themselves - to learn to challenge irrational thoughts that keep one looping in the same behavioral pattern. This book was written especially for therapists, but could be read by anyone.
