"Wyrd Sisters" is one of the books that made Terry Pratchett's reputation as the dominant fantasy author of our age.  As such, it's among his best known works, and an ideal entry point for anyone who has yet to be introduced to the marvel that is Discworld.  Granny Weatherwax teams up with Nanny Og and Magrat Garlick for the first time.  On the moor, a carriage drives up and deposits a small child, then an assassin arrives  followed by two soldiers, and before the evening is out, the witches are carrying the heir to Lancre.  Regrettably a certain Duke Felmet would prefer that there not be an heir to Lancre.  Chases, stabbings, magic, ghost sightings, propaganda, trips to Ankh-Morpork, cauldrons, Death, torture and Greebo follow in short order.

The opening sections of this book are a laugh riot in the truest sense.  There's a higher density of punchlines here than in any other Pratchett book I've read, and indeed possibly in any other book I've read.  However, it wouldn't be counted as a high watermark in the annals of fantasy just for having a few yuks.  "Wyrd Sisters" was also the moment when Pratchett's philosophy started breaking through into his stories.  In particular, "Wyrd Sisters" focuses on literature on drama and their interaction with real life.  Hence when the notorious Felmet decides to commission a play in order to rearrange the memory of certain inconvenient facts, he is exploiting the fact that human creative products become reality on the Discworld (as they do in reality).  However, on the Discworld certain problems develop when you try to shamelessly manipulate the past (just like in real life).  And nobody understands this better than Granny Weatherwax, whose old-fashioned folk wisdom trumps everyone and everything, as always, in a day-saving, up-banging, world-by-tempest-taking grand finale that will have all of Lancre cheering.  And you as well.
