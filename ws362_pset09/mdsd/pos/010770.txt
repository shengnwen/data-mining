I would highly recommend this for reading in Grades 5 - 7 for an inspiring introduction to the King Arthur legend. Works better being read in class, and gone through together as a group with a teacher, than for a kid to read on his or her own. 

Sutcliffe captures the pagan spirit of the legends with her mention of the "dark arts" and "Lordly Ones" in a compelling way. She is historically accurate as well so the text works fine in tandem with a history class in which chivalric culture of early middle ages is being taught. 

Sutcliffe does have her wordy moments and her breathless "and so it was ..." turns of phrase - oh, editor, could you not have snapped those up a bit? - but by and large her language is vivid and the stories come to life, particulary the Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Loathly Lady tales, and her take on Merlin as a yellow-eyed shape-shifter, son of a "fallen angel."
