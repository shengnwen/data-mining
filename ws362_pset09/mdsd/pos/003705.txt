Medici Effect is a good read that leads you into a journey of how innovation really occurs. It is the intersection of different fields, cultures, discplines, activities, people, etc. that leads you to a new direction for whatever problem that you are trying to solve. It strives to tie it all together in the end with the idea that you have to know what the problem is that you are trying to solve, seek out different experiences, people, etc. to give you new ideas to put together with the ideas that you already have in your head and voila - in 1 month to 8 years or more - an answer to the problem that you are trying to solve may happen. It is not a book about process - it is a book about the journey that may lead you to the solution that you are seeking
