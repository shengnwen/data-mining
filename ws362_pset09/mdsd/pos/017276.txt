I just had my first trip to Paris.  I bought this book because I like to see a city on foot.  I didn't want to be stuck on a bus for hours on end.  I had no idea just how great this book was until I used it.  There is so much hidden history to Paris that is beyond the normal tourist sites.  I saw some spectacular and beautiful places . . . often times with very few other tourists around.  That was really cool.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to experience Paris from the ground up.  Two bits of advice:  Pack some good walking shoes and take a lunch when you go
