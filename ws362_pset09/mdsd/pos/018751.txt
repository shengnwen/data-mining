The New Dictionary of Theology is an excellent resourse for the broad and timely expanse of theology.  From Abelard to Zwingli, this edition covers with precision the vissicitudes of theological movements and of the erudite artificers who commenced with fervour such oblate campaigns.  This Dictionary, however, is evangelicaly biased, but yet equally partial to the immense scope of Christian doctrine and thought.  I have thoroughly enjoyed opening this Dictionary, and will continue to do so as it knowlegeably inhances my erudition towards theology.  This book has been a blessing on my shelf, and it would be wise to purchase such a masterwork for yourself
