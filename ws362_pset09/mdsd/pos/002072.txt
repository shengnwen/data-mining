William Lennox, patriarch of the Lennox clan, has become very rich by virtue of his success in the oil business.  But now he has been cursed two-fold.  One of his wells off the coast of southern California has ruptured resulting in an uncontrolled eco-disaster involving a large segment of shoreline that ironically enough includes his own beachfront property.  

At the same time, the youngest member of the Lennox family, William's married granddaughter, Laurel Lennox Russo has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  As Lew Archer searches high and low for beautiful and troubled Laurel, he uncovers a twisted saga of family dysfunction, duplicity and murder that goes back 25 years and more.

It's not hard to see the parallels between the two storylines.  Drilling for oil in geologically unstable offshore terrain is likely to result in disaster.  In a similar fashion, a family dynasty held together by a matrix of lies and deceit may implode upon itself at any given time.

Sleeping Beauty is worthy of a 5 star rating for a number of reasons.  The characters are interesting and well fleshed out.  The dialogue is authentic sounding.  Macdonald's descriptive prose, always first rate, is particularly brilliant here.  Moreover, the wickedly complex plot all comes together in the final pages.

Ross Macdonald wrote this novel toward the end of a very long and prolific literary career.  The decades of experience show.
