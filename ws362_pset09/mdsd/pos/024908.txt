You would think that stunt performers are the ultimate risk takers. Speaking as a stunt performer in Hollywood, let me tell you that there are all kinds of risks.  Bill Treasurer taps into all of them.

Certainly my colleagues and I have few fears tackling physical obstacles, however when it comes to financial risks, emotional risks or other personal  risks that are considered outside the box, OUR box, we share the same fears as any. I've recommended this read to my colleagues to give us insight into why we do the crazy things we do, but also to help us attack fears that hold us back from succeeding in all aspects of life.

So, don't think you are the only scaredy-cat out there.  We come in all packages and we all need a little help from time to time.  Thanks, Bill, for putting your thoughts on paper for all of us to share
