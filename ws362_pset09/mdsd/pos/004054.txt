This book provides a very good overview of the different types of flooring.  It also provides some useful tricks.  I recently installed 17'x17' hardwood bamboo floor for a friend whose house is on a slab.  We had to install a vapor barrier and if you read this book you'll notice that the author and the references are generally from the UK.  So if you walk into a flooring distributor and ask for some of the products Jeffries mentioned, you will get some weird looks.  But the trick about using tape to hold the boards while the glue dried was invaluable.
