Dubin presents controversy between the art world and the political and religious realms in a way that is objective and enlightening.  A few of these readings, mainly the chapters on Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe, were assigned in a "Contemporary Art in America since 1945" Art History class I took last year.  I found this information incredible and I believe it has a poignant place in our history.  The discussions that these works generated are amazing and says a great deal about the status of art in our society and the politics unavoidably surrounding it in American contemporary culture
