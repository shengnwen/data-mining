The priciples of physical biochemsitry have not really changed in the past few decades, so although the book has not been revised since 1985, it is still an excellent reference.  The content covers topics from basic  thermodynamics to techniques such as CD and x-ray diffraction.  Although  some of the material is basic it is an ideal reference for graduate and  post-graduate level scientists exploring new areas of science.  The topics  in this book are also well complimented by another similar level book  titled Binding and Linkage by J. Wyman and S. Gill
