If you enjoy spy novels, I presume you know of this guy. If not, you need to get some Len Deighton right away. He's better than Robert Ludlum. (But aren't we all?) Better than Ian Fleming. Better than John LeCarre. Even better than Gerd Balke, who you probably haven't read. Better than any spy novelist I'm aware of. His writing is snappy, fast, easy to read, full of good stuff. He's a keen observer of human nature and he doesn't use 100 words when he only needs 10. 

Having heaped such praise upon the man, I'll tell you that I didn't finish reading this book. I read 5 of its 26 chapters and found that I didn't actually care why our spy in East Berlin wanted to cross the wall and get out of the game. Yep, it's kinda old, but I doubt I quit reading just because the wall came down. But if you like spy novels, I think this author is for you.
