A simple, predictable, yet powerful story of an old-school pitcher, Shaara's novel is a classic baseball tale.  Billy Chapel, a future Hall-of-Famer who has just learned of his trade after 17 years with the same club, decides to hang up his cleats rather than leave the team he loves.  He is not interested in money (yes, this is an obvious work of fiction), and pitches primarily for his "love of the game."

Shaara provides a unique formula for story-telling, as he interweaves flashbacks of Billy's life into his final game on the mound.  In it, Shaara shows the total concentration and focused mind of an all-time great pitcher as he progresses through his last effort as a ballplayer.  Through flashbacks, we learn of Billy's past relationships with his parents and his girl, Carol.  And during the game, Shaara provides simple, direct descriptions of the events, in an nearly non-emotional, detached tone.  Indeed, Shaara allows us to delve into the mind of a pitcher as he pitches a perfect game (although he doesn't even realize this until the 8th inning).  And, yet, the primary focus is not baseball, but his retrospect on his life and his place in the world.

Although this book may have been more polished if Shaara hadn't died suddenly, this is still a superb book and a classic "old-school" baseball tale.  For baseball purists and baseball lovers alike, this should be on the short-list of any reading list.  And even for non-baseball fans, this is still a compelling story
