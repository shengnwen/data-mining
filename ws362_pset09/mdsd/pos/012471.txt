This book gives clearly illustrated instructions on tying many very useful knots.  It organizes them under headings of Sailing, Hiking and Climbing in which they are most commonly used.  The author includes the strength of most of these knots which describes how much they weaken the lines in which they are tied - often leaving less than 50% of the original strength of the line!  Some knots do not hold well when bending (you will learn the definition of this term, as well as "hitch" and "knot") together two ropes of unequal size. Maybe you should use a different knot?  Budworth has a suggestion!

This book is both useful and interesting thanks to the inclusion of a brief history of each knot.  It did not change my life, but it did change how I secure my anchors!  I recommend it
