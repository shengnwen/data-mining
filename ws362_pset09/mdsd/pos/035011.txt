This book is practically a must for all adults, especially those with a family history of diabetes.  It not only explains how and where most of us go wrong with our eating habits, it also explains why their recommendations for changes to our eating habits can and usually will work.
I already have Type 2 diabetes but parts of that book are also directed at me.  My wife is pre-diabetic and has already been helped by some of the diet-change recommendations.  She has lost six pounds and has lowered her average glucose level readings by 10-20 mg/dl simply by following their protein : carbohydrate formula(s)
