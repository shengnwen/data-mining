A superb and enduring literary work based upon careful biblical exegesis and ancient church history which calls for reformation, now as then, in the Christian Church. Whether one agrees with all of Calvin's conclusions or not, it is evident that his writings have greatly influenced Western thought and action. These books are required reading for the culturally aware. The modern backlash against Western civil and religious tradition demands the present-day examination of these volumes.
