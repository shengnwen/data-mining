Twelve-year-old Ernesto Cata (Zu�i) is practicing to be the Fire God in a local ceremony. His best buddy George Bowlegs (Navaho) is a Zu�i wana-be.

Ernesto is missing and there is a pool of blood by his bike. The next day his buddy George runs off. It is up to Sgt. Joe Leaphorn to find the boys before anything happens to them (if it has not already.) 

As with most of Hillerman's novels everyone has different agendas and stories that overlap. There are alleged stolen artifacts form and archeological dig, and possibly a drug interest. They may or may not interact. We also get a good dose of Zu�i culture, and a feel that we are in the area.

Hillerman is nice enough to leave sufficient clues to let you figure out the mystery before Leaphorn and you then get to watch as he finally comes around to your way of thinking.

Another book by Hillerman "The Boy who Made Dragonfly" further describes the dance hall of the dead (Kothluwalawa.)

Author's Note:
"In this book, the setting is genuine.  The village of Zu�i and the landscape of the Zu�i reservation are depicted to the best of my ability.  The characters are purely fictional.  The view the reader receives of the Sha'lak'o religion is as it might be seen by a Navajo with an interest in ethnology.  It does not pretend to be more than that."
