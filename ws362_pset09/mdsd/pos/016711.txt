I wish that this had been available years ago when I owned a corgi with some of the problems covered in this book. Deborah Wood provides common sense solutions and practical techniques for dealing with shyness and its  manifestations in dogs.  I didn't pursue obedience beyond the basics,  because I felt that my corgi would not enjoy it -- now I realize that  continuing in a good training class would have been an excellent way to  help her overcome her lack of confidence around strangers.  I don't recall  seeing another dog training book specifically geared toward these issues,  and thought that the profiles of actual dogs and their owners who worked  beyond the problems shyness can cause were especially helpful.  I'd  recommend this book to shelter workers, trainers, and anyone else who wants  to add to their general knowledge of dogs.  It will have a permanent place  on my bookshelf
