For the average person this is a great introduction on how to use a computer that is running Ubuntu Linux. I love the topics that are covered and Mr. Grant didn't miss any of the basic topics that interest the average user. There were some techincal inaccuracies that the average user wouldn't notice or necessarily even care about but they don't diminish the value of this book. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars instead of a perfect score was that while the book covers step by step how to do many things it lacks any real tips or tricks for using the tools that it covers. It's possible that because he tried to cover so many topics it was difficult to incorporate more "meat" but I do think this will get someone started with some strong fundamentals and Google can help with the rest. My suggestion would be if you have someone who's not very comfortable on a computer that you want to ease into the world of Linux get them started with this book, when they come craving more knowledge get them the Official Ubuntu Book
