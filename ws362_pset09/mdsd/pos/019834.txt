I just received a copy, and haven't had time to look through it completely, but I would highly recommend this book for any ecologists (particularly graduate students like myself) who are working with organisms that have any biological connection to the soil.  Just looking at the number of pages, it's been updated and expanded quite a bit since the first edition.  Chapter 4, on soil organisms, is big and relatively descriptive (with useful pictures).  Also covers in significant detail microbial communities (Ch. 3), nutrient cycling (Ch. 5), soil food webs (Ch. 6), the relationship between biodiversity and soil (Ch. 7) and includes quite a few sampling methodologies.  This book covers, but does not stress the plant-soil relationship (Ch. 2, only a little over 20 pages), which is nice since that information has been of greater historical focus and is covered well elsewhere, while this book's strength is on things that are not as well covered in the standard literature.  Other books that cover similar material as this one would be Dindal's (1990) "Soil Biology Guide" (a classic, animal taxonomy-centered tome in this field) and Wood's (1989) smaller, more ecology-centered text "Soil Biology" (too much like this one to justify purchasing it now?).  Coleman et al.'s emphasis on ecology makes this book stand out as a great reference
