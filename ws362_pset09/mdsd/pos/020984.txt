     I can't praise this book enough. It has literally saved me hundreds of dollars in pet care costs and more importantly saved at least one of my pets' life. I've owned my copy for at least eight years. I have a Weimaraner with allergies which this book has kept her allergy free without the prescriptions recommended by the vet. 
     More recently I had a cat with a blocked urethra, common in male cats, which can also lead to a rapid and painful death if they are completely blocked. The emergency vet wanted $1500 to catheter and care for the cat for two days with antibiotics etc. I opted to have them do the catheter ($300) and took him home to care for him. I followed the books instructions. He did great right away by giving him the vitamins the book suggests and the prescription food the vet suggested. But after two weeks of being 100% well he started to have blood in his urine again, the first sign of the problem. Then I realized that I had slacked off on the vitamins the book suggests, (vitamin C, and some others).  I had mistakenly assumed the "prescription" food would be good enough. I immediately gave him the books homeopathic remedy followed by the books recommended vitamins and their "Healthy Powder" (recipe in the book) and his problem cleared up the next day and he has had no signs of any problem since. He is in the best health he's ever known! And I'm being smarter about his needs. 
If you care about your pets, believe in their own abilities to heal, and natural and holistic approaches to pet health, this book is the best; it's the one I go to first to find the answers to my pet's problems.
