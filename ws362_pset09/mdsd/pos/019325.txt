Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose have done it again!
Only this time someone or something has captured poor Winnie, the zoo's main attraction and it's up to someone to find these thieves. 
The kidnapper wants 1 million dollars or Green Lawn will never see Winnie again.

Will Dink, Josh and Ruth Rose be able to find the kidnapper or will they be too late to save her?
