It has everything that a lay man needs to know in order to make best use of his digital camera. In fact you should buy the book before buying a camera as it has a pretty good guide about what various features mean and what you should look for based on your needs/budget. 

You do not need to know anything about photgraphy (digital or film) to follow this book. It will teach you from scratch - all you need to know about framing, white balance, and focus and exposure control. Also includes a great deal of information about editing your images on a computer. If you are a wanna-be photographer like me, with little or no experience, go ahead and get this book. It will help you go a long way
