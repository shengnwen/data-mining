Although this book targets authors with book contracts, it offers plenty of info for self-publishers (SP). I am still in an SP learning curve and have so far read eight books on promo/marketing/publicity. Concise and clearly written, this book offers so many useful tips, that it should be the first one you try, despite the fact that one-third of the book does not apply to SP. I had a loosely formed marketing strategy before, but now the early stages are in sharp focus, thanks to this book. The only beef I have is that the author did not summarize all the webiste addresses at the end of each chapter. Finally, this book and Dan Poynter's Self-Publishing Manual are the  key titles necessary to make an informed decision about whether SP is right for you
