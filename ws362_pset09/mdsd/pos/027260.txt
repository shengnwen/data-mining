This book is the story of Wayne Weible's journey to Medjugorje. This book changed my life. It tells of the Blessed Mother's appearances to six croation kids in Medjugorje. It tells of his personal conversion and calling to spread the messages Our Lady is giving us there. These messages are truly from God, and if one is looking for a book to make his/her spiritual life better, this is the book for him/her. I also reccommend reading Medjugorje Day By Day, a daily medatation book. These apparitions have not yet been approved not because of their authenticity, but because the apparitions are still going on, and the Catholic church can only approve appartitions until after they have ceased. This book is amazing
