More "sound advice" from the autor of "Sever Habits of Highly Effective People". Quite a few (at least semi) practical advices in this book - building on the priveate and public victories.

Althoug it may not be absolutely necessary to read The Sever Habits in advance, it undoubtedly would be an advantage .
