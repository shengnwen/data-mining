In &quot;A Week at the Beach&quot;, the Hubals have captured the essence of the sun and sea.  Some of the suggested activities took me back to childhood experiences -- things I did in youthful innocence and had long since forgotten.  Bits of wisdom, obscure facts, silly puns and occasional challenges are nestled between the mix of fun and inspirational activities.  (Do you know the history of the bikini or why the Peruvians call the warm Pacific current El Nino?)  Inspiring and well-written, this book will be a permanent part of our beach trips as I look forward to re-creating some of those childhood memories!
