Stewart O'Nan is right to compare Arvin's collection to the early work of TC Boyle.  There is a searching intelligence behind these stories and a real concern for how progress effects people.  I particularly enjoyed the title story and Commemorating.  Take Your Child to Work is heartbreaking.  Telescope might be the coolest short-short I've read in years
