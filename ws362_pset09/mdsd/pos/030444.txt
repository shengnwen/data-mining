	The Stranger Next Door is about a cat named Pete and two kids, Alex and Clifford. Clifford must change his name, he doesn't even know why until later. Clifford must leave everything behind including Rocky, his dog, and therefore makes his nickname Rocky. Ricky's new house is next door to a new kid's. The new kid is Alex.
                  Alex and his cat, Pete, just moved into a new town. There is a new family moving next door, and Alex is happy about that. Soon the house next door is burnt down. Rocky, the kid next door, is inside. Pete saves the day by waking up Alex. Alex wakes up his parents and they wake up the Morris', Rocky's family. The string of fires doesn't stop. Alex must find out who did them.
	 This book is a wonderful story and I would recommend it for kids of ages 10-12. The only thing about this book that I find a little bit strange is the author says that anything in italics their cat, Pete, has written. I think that this book has its ups and downs but it is a fantastic book over all. It is a nominee for the Massachusetts Book Award, and that is a great honor
