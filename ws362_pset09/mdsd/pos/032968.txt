This is an excellent book.  It is beautifully illustrated, making it a lovely overview of Van Gogh's drawings, visually-speaking.  
It is also very well-written, researched and scholarly.  The interweaving of biography, history and art makes it a great resource for research.
I am particularly interested in prints and drawings as art media and work in an Art Gallery, so I find the book to be a good addition to my personal art history library.
It compares well with Rubens:  The Drawings, a recent catalogue for a Metropolitan Museum Exhibition
