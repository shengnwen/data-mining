"I Was A Rat" was an awesome book because....It taught me to always believe in my heart. But some times it can cause catastrophies. I really loved everything about this book!It was funny,sad and surprising. I think anybody who reads this book is sure to love it.Well at least I did! If i could give this book a ten I would. Sarah
