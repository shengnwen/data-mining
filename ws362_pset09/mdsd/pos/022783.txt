Technical Virgin by Hayley DiMarco is another of her outstanding books that pull no punches and have totally plain talk and facts about sex which teenage girls need to know. The statistics of STDs in young teens is appalling, and DiMarco tells the straight facts about how "just messing around but not going all the way" can also cause a person to get sexually transmitted diseases, depression, and other severe health and psychological problems, in addition to the risk of pregnancy. The book is written for Christian girls and their parents but would be beneficial to all teens, male or female, to know the facts. As unbelievable as it seems to parents and older generations, a large percentage of girls from early teens are engaged in all types of sexual activity, even when they have pledged abstinance, because to these young people nothing but intercourse is considered sex. Parents, this is a MUST READ with your daughter.
