Julia Child and Jacques Pepin make French cooking seem so approachable on television, and this book is consistent with that attitude.  Simple recipes, like roast chicken with lemon and rosemary and pan-fried steak turn out deliciously.  I must caution that the layout of the book--a point/counterpoint in which each chef presents his/her approach--results in a cumbersome book.  For example, directions for one dish may appear several pages later than its ingredients.  An accompanying sauce may be five, ten pages back.  It wouldn't be a bad idea to use those sticky bookmarks in advance of preparing the recipe.  The instructional photos could have been much better.  A photo showing how to extract a wishbone, for example, is confusing.  I would have liked to see more step-by-step series of photos since a single shot is often inadequate.  This is definitely a hybrid--part cookbook, part coffeetable  tome.  Therein lies the difficulty but also the enjoyment
