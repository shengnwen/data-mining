I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't quite as well written as the first - &quot;The Wild Road&quot;.  Reading only short amounts on a daily basis, it was sometimes difficult to follow the many story threads.  It was fun to remember places in New Orleans as Sealink visited them.  The author(s) were clever in reintroducing some characters from the first book.  I think Tag could have (or should have) played a larger part in this book and did not need to seem so bewildered through out it.  It seems there could be a third book coming
