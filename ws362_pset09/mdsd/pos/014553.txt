This is a tremendous book for anybody wanting in-depth information on geography and warfare but who does not have the technical background of a geographer or military analyst.  It is full of excellent, high-quality photographs, and three-dimensional drawings that supplement the text in an excellent fashion.  Maps are drawn, not reproduced from older texts, and the clarity and detail is beyond reproach.  Chapters are organized by subject matter and the book even contains simplified explanations of satellite reconaisance and outer space applications.  This is an excellent book
