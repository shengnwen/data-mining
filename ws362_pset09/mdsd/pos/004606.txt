"Going too Far" was the BEST story I've read this year. The plot was exciting, the romance tintillating, and the dialogue being a mixture of humor and sexual excitement all led into one GREAT READ. I stayed up all night reading this story. I just could not put it down. It was just that good. One of the biggest problems that I have with Suzanne's stories are her WWII subplots. Fortunately, she kept this one down to a minumum, which left more time for Sam & Alyssa to really shine. Brockmann had been building us up for Sam & Alyssa's story for a long time. It was well worth the wait as this was a great story!!!!!
