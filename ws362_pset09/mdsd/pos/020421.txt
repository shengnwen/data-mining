Where do I begin?  I enjoyed &quot;Sex and the Bible&quot; for many reasons.  As a lover of history it is always helpful for me to learn the root of an issue.  Dr. Conaway begins at the beginning and moves forward  through time, step-by-step.  God established sexuality.  Man, influenced by  satan, perverted sexuality.  If you did not understand these concepts prior  to reading the book, you will have a clearer picture after your reading.   Including the consequences of not following God's PERFECT plan for  sexuality in your life.   Throughout the book, Dr. Conaway also uses  scientific data to support and explain his work.  There are sections that  are quite technical, for fans of science, but useful for all.  &quot;Sex  and the Bible&quot; is an excellent tool for teaching adolescents through  adults basic and critical points about human anatomy, sexuality, and how  they intertwine. Chapter 7, &quot;Soul Ties&quot; is must reading for  anyone who wants to better understand why we sometimes become codependent  on others. I will definitely continue to recommend the book. It was helpful  to me personally as a married woman and will also prove useful as I advise  others on sexual and emotional pitfalls to avoid.  Bring on the next  project Dr. Conaway
