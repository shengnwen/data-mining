Depending on what you look for in a "travel" book you may or may not like this.  If you're looking for history, natural history, or political developments, this is not the book for you.  It is not comprehensive in any way.

If you're looking for entertaining reading set in an interesting location with snippets of odd information this book would be entertaining.  Of travel authors I have read, this author most closely resembles Theroux, but without the curmudgeonly judging.  Like Theroux, his facts may or may not be correct but he doesn't claim to be writing a textbook, just some stuff that happened to him in this place.

Mercifully, Chatwin spares us deep philosphical introspections so prevalent in much modern "travel" writing.

I read it and enjoyed it and recommend it
