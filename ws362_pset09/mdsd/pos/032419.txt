I bought the 2003 edition of The Sports Encyclopedia: Baseball today, &amp; as usual am overall pleased with the wealth of information in this very valuable book. However, there are a few problems which the editors need to resolve for future editions.This series has always been plagued by poor editing &amp; typos, &amp; the 2003 edition is no exception. In fact, there is one HUGE error that should never have gotten past whoever edited this edition. Turn to page 700 &amp; you'll see it: instead of the statistics for the 2002 NL Championship Series between St. Louis &amp; San Francisco the ones for the 2001 NLCS between Arizona &amp; Atlanta have been reprinted. Someone should have caught this major blunder.Since this annual series does have typos &amp; errors (what book with so much info doesn't?) the editors should provide their readers with an e-mail or snail mail address to notify them of mistakes so they can be corrected. I was able to do so in the 1980s &amp; several errors were corrected. I hope the editors will be open to input from their readers once again, for that only strengthens the factual integrity of the book.I'm sure there are other mistakes but the one above is the reason I give The Sports Encyclopedia: Baseball 2003 a rating of 4 instead of 5. It will make a good addition to your baseball reference library, but it's probably a good idea to have another encylopedia handy to doublecheck the info. Trust, but verify, with all these huge statistical books, I say
