Every woman should seriously consider reading this book! Whether you're clueless about fashion or you're a fashionista, there's something in here for you.

Written by a leading stylist, the book helps you develop your own style instead of bowing to current fashion trends. Among the topics covered:

*How to assess if a garment fits you properly and how to take your measurements. Measurements are a much easier way to shop, especially considering the recent trend toward vanity sizing.

*How to identify and dress for your body type. This section takes up a large chunk of the book. It tells you the best pants, skirts, tops, coats, and dresses for your shape. Also, because the book is aimed at everyday women, it includes heavier body types.

*How to clean out your closet. It helps you sort out what to keep and what to toss. There are also several suggestions on how to get organized using uniform hangers, boxes, drawer dividers, and more. This section also touches on proper storage and care for your clothes and accessories to make them last longer.

*How to shop strategically. It starts by listing pieces that every wardrobe needs and lists stores that are most likely to have what you need for your body type. (This section is great, but if you want a more detailed look at building a wardrobe, check out The Lucky Shopping Manual. It's another must-have.) There's also a helpful guide to fabrics and tips on how to avoid mistakes many women make - dressing too sexy, too young, and more.

*Tailors. How to find a good one, and what they can and can't fix - they can hem pant legs, nip the waist of a jacket, but even the best tailor can't help with a garment that's too small for you. There's also a brief section on what you should expect to pay.

*My favorite section of the book is "What Lies Beneath." It includes instructions on how to measure for your correct bra size, a list of thong alternatives (No woman needs to own a thong.) and a guide to selecting the right hosiery and shapewear. There's also a great little section on "illusions," including breast pads, shoulder pads, and how to use toupee tape to keep your clothes in place. There's also a bare bones section on hair and makeup. (For a more detailed look at this, check out Beautified by Queer Eye For the Straight Guy's Kyan Douglas.)

*Accessories. What shoes to wear and how they should fit, what handbags to carry, what sunglasses work best with your face shape, and how to select the best jewelry for your outfit, and - something I've never personally thought about - your body type. (For example, it recommends that petite women stick to wearing only one or two pieces of jewelry so as not to overwhelm their small frames.) There are also suggestions for appropriate scarves, hats, and belts.

If you're looking to improve your wardrobe, this is worth a read. It provides a thorough look to all the different aspects of fashion and presents the theory to dressing well rather than just telling you what to wear. Because of this, it will be a handy reference book even as styles and trends change
