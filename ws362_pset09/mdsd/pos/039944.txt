I bought this book to use for my Labor Economics class at Cornell University. My professor, Professor Smith, is a contributor to this book and it was a wonderful supplement to the lectures. The book is filled with  useful information and practical applications, so its appeal is not limited  to economics students, but anyone who wishes to know more about payroll  taxes, policy applications, work incentives and the like. This  easy-to-understand book benefited me a lot and I  would recommend its use  to other courses in labor economics at other colleges and universities
