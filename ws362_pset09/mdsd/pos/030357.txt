"The Dark is Rising" goes beyond
Your average fairy tale
Completely different from the first
It makes that one quite pale

Over sea yet under stone
The first book was a treasure
But this one's cut of different cloth
For older children's pleasure

The seventh of a seventh son
Young Will's a special child
When he gets to ten plus one
His life gets really wild

Keeper of six mighty signs
Part of the Things of Power
Will's an Old One, he's the last
He stands when mortals cower

Iron, Bronze, Wood and Stone
In circles cut in four
Add fire and water to make six
You couldn't ask for more

The Dark rises, the Walker walks
Black Rider's on the loose
Can the Lord of Light and the Old Ones
defeat and cook his goose?

With ancient books and simple rhymes
And magic, old, and wild
This gripping tale of Light and Dark
Will entertain your child
