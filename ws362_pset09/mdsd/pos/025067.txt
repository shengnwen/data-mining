This book left the reader hungry for more: hungry for names, addresses, contacts .. WHERE to go to carry out a therapeutic fast!

Fuhrman has written an enthralling book - geared perhaps primarily towards an American audience - about the benefits of therapeutic fasting. He is convincing owing to the explanations about the effects of the fast to the extent that it suddenly becomes obvious that a good clean out would be an excellent idea even for those who already pay attention to what they eat. But he is not a fanatic, since he also wisely cautions on the need to carry out the fast under supervision.

The book also warns on the dangers of the American diet, showing the illnesses which arise from its excesses. The reader becomes aware that there is a definite link between what we eat and the illnesses we develop which gives him the opportunity to assume responsibility for his health. The author also gives guidelines as to what to eat for optimal health. This reader  would have liked a whole chapter to be devoted to what and how to eat, since he suggests cereals and grains and one is left wondering whether to eat them with milk, or soya milk or rice milk! 

In conclusion, although advocating a radical change in eating habits, Fasting and Eating for Health opens readers eyes to the necessity for adopting a healthy lifestyle.
