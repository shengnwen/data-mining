This was an amazing series that has something for everyone, if your into westerns, horror, science fiction, or fantasy then you will absolutely love these books. I was enthralled by it all and read them all within a few months. I would also suggest "The Stand", "Hearts in Atlantis", "The Green Mile", and many other King books
