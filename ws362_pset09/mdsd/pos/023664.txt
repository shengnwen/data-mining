A Midsummer Night's Dream is one of Shakespeare's greatest plays and yet is his most slaughtered play on stage. It is a play that exists on an archetypal and mythic level. It is so universal and yet so much a part of our lives, that it is so hard to grasp. There are so many worlds that exist within the play, from a magical fairy world to Shakespeare's own contemporary actors. One of the most fascinating questions that the play puts forward is: How much control of our lives do we really have? Do bad things happen from our own doing or is there another working force like Puck that goes around causing mischief. The play also raises a debate of love. If you look at the lovers in the play, you could take a cynical view and see that it doesn't really matter who has who because they are all the same and all marriage leads to unhappiness. You could also learn that when two people have the same mutual feelings of love towards each other, it is a truly amazing thing. In the end, one gets that love is a vicious cycle that rarely falls out right but when it does, it must be acted on for it may never fall out perfectly again. Even though Oberon and Puck cause grief on the lover's, the mechanicals and Bottom, they restore everything to good in the end. The heart and humor of this play exists with Bottom and The Mechanicals. While Shakespeare is obviously mocking the bad acting of his time, he still sympathizes with the actors and lets them steal the show at the end. Midsummer also probably features Shakespeare's most beautiful poetry he wrote, that paints a magical and mystical picture is the mind's eye. A truly amazing piece
