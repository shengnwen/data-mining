David Herbert Martin gives readers a very personal view of Lincoln.  We see that Old Abe was honest and gifted, but also calculating, ambitious, and burdened by self-doubt.  Perhaps that's normal for an introspective man who overcomes poverty, depression and tragedy.  The author maintains this very personal focus as he details Lincoln's rise from young legislative leader and one-term Congressman to national figure as visionary builder of the nascent Republican Party in the 1850's. 

Martin continues his personal focus on President Lincoln.  Readers see that Lincoln was slightly unsure at first, a bit slow with emancipation, and he made some poor choices for military leadership.  But Lincoln was a masterful politician, and his leadership, eloquence, and vision helped keep the nation together through tragedy.  Finally, readers sense the gut-wrenching pressure Lincoln faced on a daily basis.  In short, the author correctly shows Lincoln as great but imperfect, and readers should come away believing that Old Abe did a better job than would have William Seward, Stephen Douglas, or other top contenders.     

I gave the book just four stars due to the author's somewhat thick writing style, and his absence of summary writing after Lincoln's passing.  Still, this superbly personal biography is well worth reading.
