This is a great book for introducing a gifted child to using patterns to quickly solve math problems.  The riddles guide you to the author's solution.  However, another valuable lesson is that there are many ways to solve a math problem.  

I gave this book to my gifted five year old son the summer before he began first grade.  He loved the rhymes and the pictures.  He especially liked finding clever ways to count the objects without counting one by one.  We made a family game of solving each riddle, working to see who would solve it first.  Then we shared our strategies and reviewed the author's strategy which is presented in the back of the book.  

I highly recommend this book!  It provides opportunities for great mental math practice.   Gifted children love patterns.  This book builds on that and helps them to see additional ways in which finding patterns could be useful
