The myth, a myth that I had been taught and which continues to be the popular belief, of all America working together during the big war is certainly exploded in Brinkley's tome. Brinkley's insight explains why some black folks still do not like white folks...not that I blame them.  If I were African American, I would not like me either.  America apparently did not like women much either, although they were better tolerated than racial minorities.  Our local book club could not find any glaring factual errors, anyhow.  Reading how each interest often worked for itself and against other interests makes me wonder how we managed to win the war after all.  Brinkley's book is a bit slow going, but it is a detailed resource which should be read by students of U.S. history as well as the general public
