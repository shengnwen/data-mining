I don't know what the Santa Cruz reviewer is thinking.  This is a handy book, and has helped me keep track of many different maintenance and renovation details of my home.  The reviewer says he can't store his household manuals in this book.  Of course not!  What book exists that allows someone to store all such manuals?  If you are looking for a method to simply and easily keep track of paint colors, vendor names and numbers, warranty information, etc., I strongly recommend this convenient, affordable journal
