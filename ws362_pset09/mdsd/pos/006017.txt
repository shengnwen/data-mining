Dixon is a former artillery officer, Sandhurst graduate, and  self-described authoritarian personality, who left the Army and became a  clinical psychologist.  He uses both sets of experiences to analyze why  officers in armies throughout history--mostly British, but the principles  are generally applicable--have fallen into a stereotypical pattern of  incompetence specific to senior military leaders.  Much of the reason, he  believes, derives from personality development, but the book is  refreshingly devoid of psychobabble and is written in an astonishingly  clear style.  A real eye-opener, after which military history will not be  quite the same to the reader again
