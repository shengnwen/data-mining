If you have never read any of Ms. Brockmann's books, you MUST try this one. Great story, great characters (esp Mallory and David!), great author. I have read all of Ms. Brockmann's work and she is truly great.  When I purchase her books I can't put them down.   In this book there are no main characters, all of Ms. Brockmann's characters play center stage.  I strongly recommend reading this and catching up on other Suzanne Brockann novels!!!!!!!!!
