Upon receiving my copies of "Contracts" audio CDs (Douglas J. Whaley), I am surprised at the negative reviews.  Having completed two masters degrees, I have plenty of experience with poor instructors, poor textbooks, poor audio lessons; and poor universities.    In my opinion, these Contracts CDs are excellent.  Professor Whaley provides:  (a) a clear speaking voice; (b) excellent inflection to keep the listener's attention; (c) good humor and vocabulary; (d) humorous case examples (e.g., minors as chimpanzees, dog law, paid-in-full checks, etc.); (e) well-organized lectures; and (f) plenty of detail to support further research.  While I am not a Law student, these CDs are providing an excellent refresher for my MBA Business Law classes.  These CDs are worth the price, and I will be ordering Professor Whaley's CDs on "Sale & Lease of Goods" (as well as the Finz CDs on Torts)
