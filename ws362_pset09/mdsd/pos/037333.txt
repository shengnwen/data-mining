I believe one of the previous reviews of this book tried to criticize it for its &quot;preaching of liberal dogmas&quot; and tried to say that it was unbalanced.  This is simply not the case.  The author of this text is merely trying to use an open approach to encompass all aspects of sociology and thereby be a little more open-minded in his writing. So there's a little subjectivity, who cares? It's nearly impossible to write something and be 100 percent objective because there will always be a bit of your own opinion of the matter leak into what you're trying to point out.  The point is, this book is simply fascinating from front to back.  It is extremely easy to relate to and understand (though it is not meant for high schoolers), the information is surprisingly up-to-date with many examples in the charts and graphs, and it is simply fun to read.  The book covers everything from the sociological perspective and culture to global stratification and social change in such a broad manner that you'll never lose track of what you're reading.  Not only this, but the book also comes with some amazing study materials including links to a website with some of the best quizzes I've seen (they've helped me tremendously on my tests) and also other study guides such as flash cards and outlines of the chapters to help you make a study guide.  All in all, Henslin's book IS the best book out there on which to embark your study of sociology.  Even if you don't like it, you will find yourself interested by the many examples that Henslin provides to relate to his concepts.  The only gripe I have is the fact that the book is paperback.  If you're able to find a hardback edition please do so because it will last longer and will be able to be used a lot more often than the paperback will
