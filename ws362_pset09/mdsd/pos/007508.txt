Bryan Garner brings clarity and insight to the confounding world of legal writing.  "Legal Writing in Plain English" contains dozens of comments and guidelines that should be burned into the brain of every attorney.  Some of these are obvious (e.g., use a readable typeface), while others are more nuanced (e.g., delete perhaps the legal drafter's favorite legalism, "provided that").  Each suggestion urges the writer toward a simple yet difficult goal -- be a good writer so that your reader doesn't have to work so darn hard to understand you.

As everyone knows, a simple manual of rules can be maddeningly dull and preachy.  Garner has enlivened his book by including a number of practical exercises so that the reader can put these guidelines into practice before the next memo or brief.  These exercises range from "basic" to "advanced," and are well worth the time.

After reading this book (and attending Mr. Garner's one-day seminar), I submit that this book should be required reading for every One-L and associate.
