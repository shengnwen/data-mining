Bjorn Turoque has only won an air guitar competition once (and I was there to witness it), but with To Air Is Human, he proves that he is the #1 ambassador of air, at least in the U.S. Mr. Turoque/Crane/Retard masterfully and humorously takes us into the magical world of competitive air guitar--what it's like to have to explain to your girlfriend why an imaginary instrument must dominate your life, what it's like to compete in 10 competitions and come in second five times, what it's like to live out your rock-star fantasies, and best of all, what it's like to score with an "air groupie."

Turoque explores the "beautiful" dynamic of air guitar in Finland, home to the Air Guitar World Championships, in which he has competed twice. The scenes in Finland focus on the unity of the human spirit--from the inspiring words of two-time former world champ Zac "The Magnet" Monro to the air guitar competitions for the "differently abled." Turoque's quest in life and with this book is to introduce America, which should be the leader of air guitar rock-stardom, to this concept. Turoque, a true Nietzche buff, analyzes air guitar with philosophy, pop-culture references, laugh-out-loud humor, and writing skills that have gotten his works published in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.

This book might not inspire you to air guitar competitively, but you will laugh. And you will embrace the rock star that resides within. Two thumbs up--or better yet, double devil-horns way up with a C-Diddy-sized tongue sticking way out
