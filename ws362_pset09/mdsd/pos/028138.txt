This book attempts to explain longstanding anecdotes on parts of
the human body-their origin, function and meaning. The history
of the handshake is explained. The integration of hand movements and language has an interconnection according to the author.
The nose is cited as a part of the body which gets the least
respect as body parts go. The purity of breasts is extolled in
pop art. Overall, the book is a celebration of the human body.
A criticism is that it seems to lack a unifying theme or purpose.
It is unique in that the information content is out-of-the-
ordinary. The author even has a passage describing the arrid
landscape on the Marsian planet. The author experiments with
a bold escape from conventional writing themes in favor of
amorphous theoretical concepts not subject to exact quantification
