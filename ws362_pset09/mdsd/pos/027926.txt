This book is probably the best cook book I have ever used.  It contains detailed descriptions of a vast array of seafood along with copious information on buying and prepping each type. The recipes range from simple to modestly complex.  They generally focus on enhancing the flavor of the seafood with a few well selected accent flavors.  They are creative and easy to follow.
