Doctor Zhivago, written by Boris Pasternak, is a story about the turmoil of revolutionary Russia and its people.  It begins a few years before the Bolshevik Revolution and follows events that lead to Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet government.  The main character is Dr. Zhivago, a kind and passionate man, who is constantly affected by these events.
The book has excellent historical value as well as detail of its characters so that it fully embodies the disorderly mindset of the people.  This is most evident in Dr. Zhivago's relationship with a woman named Lara.  He and his wife Tonya were happily married but when he was drafted to a medical outpost he fell in love with the nurse Lara.  Though the Doctor is a good man he is torn between his two loves and inevitably cheats on Tonya.  His relationship with Lara beautifully parallels the political struggle that was taking place in Russia.  She represents the Communist Russia that the people longed for.  She is so close yet unattainable; every time the doctor begins to settle with her they experience pain and hardship, whether it be by outside forces or their own actions.  She is impossible to reach, impossible to forget, and their relationship, like the revolution, was impossible stop once it began.  Dr. Zhivago allows the reader to witness a struggle of the human mind's judgment and its desires.  It demonstrates that our decisions can start us in one direction and that life's unforeseeable circumstances can easily lead us astray.
