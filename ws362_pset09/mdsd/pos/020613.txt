Everyone should read this book.  It's a direct path to taking responsibility for one's thoughts, words, and actions.  It's a path that would be more accepting to the overall public.

I can only compare it with Gary Renard's "The Disappearance of the Universe".  I believe Gary's route to returning home to pure Love is a little more severe.  He doesn't tiptoe through the tulips, so to speak; he tells you just how it is - forgive, or continue as you have been doing and accepting the insanity that keeps staring you in the face.

I read Gary's book first and was totally accepting of it, however, I've been searching for 'Truth' for a long time.  In other words, I'm not foreign to this type of philosophy.  

Nevertheless, people who have not been searching, nor understand the concept of forgiveness, may reject Gary's route to understanding pure Love, but be more accepting of Marieanne's path to Love
