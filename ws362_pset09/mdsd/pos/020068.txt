This is a great book for someone interested in the basics of Western philosophy.  It covers the pre-Socratics, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle in a compact 109 pages.   
It is true that all Western philosophy is &quot;footnotes to Plato.&quot;  Later authors expand and improve on Plato, but his texts are the beginning.   

This text gives you a very readable intro to Plato's main thoughts and his inspiration, i.e., his teacher--Socrates
