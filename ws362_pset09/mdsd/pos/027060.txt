If you have a clear understanding of the Microsoft core technologies but are new to Exchange this book is about as good as it gets in my opinion. Bear in mind that the technical scope and depth of Exchange Server 2003 is substantial and therefore hard to understand easily in a clear manner without the correct training material. 

To begin with I was pleasantly surprised at the logical way the book was laid out. The best part was the way concepts were explained in a clear and complete manner. Of course there were many concepts below my level which too were explained serving to give me a new perspective into an old understanding which has proven to be valuable also.

As I worked through this book, which I found really easy to do, I experienced light bulbs lighting up all over the place and dots being connected everywhere. I had a great experience with this book. It has taken me a lot further along the way.

I would have given the book a 5 star rating, but I do not know if it covers all of the test material.

Going forward, I will look for other training material by these same authors.
