I am currently working on an installation piece and purchased this book as a reference and resource material. I have to say that superficially, as a picture book, this is a great book to have for looking through and enjoying images of other installation work. The book has numerous, large, and beautiful full color images of a vast variety of works spanning the genre. The content is made up of a lot of bits and pieces of different opinions from art historians and artists, but the reading definitely proves that there is no one side to this medium. The book is able to show that there are many exciting and various approaches to installation art, and above all, no limitations.
