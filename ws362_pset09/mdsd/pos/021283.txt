Average American citizen do not have much contact with the outside of the United States. Even he or she watches 4 hours TV every night, it is very difficult to hear from outsiders about America (Except Middle East Hatred) Mr.Hertsgaard looks for likes/dislike of other people about America. His interviews are very enlightening and interesting. Sometimes it is very bothering but reality bites, that is what people think and they have their reason. Every American should read this book and criticize the book (some parts I do not agree) and themselves honestly. Every nation has some flaws, but the cure start with true findings. That makes America real superpower.
