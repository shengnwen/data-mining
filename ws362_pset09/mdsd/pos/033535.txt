     Red Lily is clearly the best book in the series.  While reading this one I could visualize the scenes.  This book would make a good movie, but I can't decide under what category it would fit into.  Although it's clearly a romance portions of the book would definitely be considered a thriller.  With all the talk of a ghost (as the rest of the series) this book it isn't a believable read as much as a fun read.
