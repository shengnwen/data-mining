I have found this book extremely useful in ID'ing artifacts in the field and the lab.  It contains historical background on all the major types of artifacts you'd expect to find on an historic site, and many facts on  uncommon ones as well.  It's organized alphabetically so it's easy to use,  too.  If you can get your hands on a copy, I'd recommend it
