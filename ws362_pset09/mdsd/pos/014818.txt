I recommend reading this book along with Bruce Bawer's excellent WHILE EUROPE SLEPT. Unlike the authors of so many books that have come out on this subject since 9/11, both Claire Berlinski and Bawer are neither agenda-driven Christian Evangelicals or members of some neo-conservative think tank playing upon the fears and prejudices of the American public. Both have worked and lived in Europe and offer first hand experience as well as exceptional research. Berlinski is a novelist (see LOOSE LIPS and her soon-to-be-published LION EYES) and a secular Jew whose experience with Europe's dilemma goes back to her days as a university student, living in England and France.

MENACE IN EUROPE is a mixture of humor and alarm. For example Berlinski writes about agro-radical Jose Bove, parralleling his life and career with the millennialists of Medieval Europe. Or consider the chapter she devotes to the bombastic German rock group Rammstein, showing the group's lyrics and press releases, describing their videos, as examples of what she sees as the European penchant for nihilist aesthetics and bleak worldview. It is this approach that makes Berlinski's book an entertaining as well as enlightening read. 

Berlinski goes beyond the fact that Europe's Muslim population is rising and that it is antagonistic towards Western values. She shows that Europe's problems are old ones: class warfare, collectivism, over-reliance on the State, the loss of faith and respect for religious institutions that are often replaced with nihilist philosophies, ad nauseum. Such things predate the relatively recent influx of immigration from the Islamic world by centuries. Europeans are now faced with an alien population in their midst, one that no longer wishes to remain apart. Rather, emboldened by what they see as a decadent culture and enfeebled population, these immigrants are now trying to impose their lifestyle and worldview.
