I just got this book from the local library and read it in an afternoon.  I'm an amature homebrewer, by no means an expert, but this book allowed me to learn a great deal about brewing in general, not just the Pale Ale family.  I am very interested in doing some of the all-grain recipes listed in the book.

Let us start at the beginning of this book, Foster covers a brief history of Pale ale, establishing that the three Ales are very similar and that the distinctions he makes for ease of learning are by no means universal.

He then begins the discussion over the characteristics.  His discussion includes many different variables in the brewing process, including the use of adjuncts.  Interestingly enough, he does not outrightly condem the usage of additives, he does give a list of benefits and detriments to caution the brewer in his usage of additives.

Shortly after this Foster begins a lengthy discussion on the storage and carbonation of beer.  
Foster does a good job of describing the different characteristics of the ales and how to get those characteristics into your own beer.

The only reason that I give this book a 4 instead of 5 is because  Foster spends far too much time explaining how to put Pale ale into wooden casks.  I understand that he really enjoys this, but he mentions several times that people will never want to really deal with wooden barrels.  I would have liked to learn more about the specific styles of breing and how they can be implemented in a home-brew setting.

Over all, read this book.  If you're serious about brewing a good IPA (and inviting the author over to taste it, which he say's he'll not refuse!), buy this book.  If you just want to sound smart drinking with your buds, get it from the library
