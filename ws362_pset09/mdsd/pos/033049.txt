Reading some parts of this book was one of my assignments in my  &quot;Contemporary Political Transitions&quot; class in the University.  When I read the assigned parts, I immediately decided to read the whole  book. One of the most fascinating things about the book is that what you  read there has been experienced lively by the author. Misha Glenny is very  clear and he really manages to reach the audience. The chapters are very  well organized. Especially the last chapter is very well organized and it  includes a brief review together with an evaluation of the author.  Nevertheless, if you decide to buy and read the book, I would advice you to  make a brief research on the war in Yugoslavia and have a brief background.  If you don't know anything about the subject, then you may find the book a  little bit confusing. However, if you read the book having a little  background about the issue, then you will definitely enjoy it
