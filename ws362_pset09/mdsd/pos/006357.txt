I got into sea kayaking after reading this book and it is all the author said and more. I've lent this book to a number of friends who are now also &quot;hooked&quot;.  This is an easy to read book, one that evokes the  possibilities of kayaking along with information necessary to develop the  confidence to make them happen. I highly recommend it to anyone considering  this great sport
