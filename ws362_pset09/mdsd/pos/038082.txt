After accurately addressing the current state of affairs in the United States government, which can be called by many names - Chomsky uses polyarchy - he radically reframes the last several decades of U.S. history in impressive detail, and his work is to be commended.  

My major criticism is that he gave far too little attention to the idea of polyarchy and the problems it attempts to address.  Such an issue bitterly divided the Founders, but is far older than the United States - Plato dwelled on it in "The Republic."  He saw a democracy as nothing but a wreckless mob, and that they must be ruled like children by "guardians," who live apart from the masses and consider the good of the people more important than their own.  

Of course such guardians are very rare - for every Marcus Aurelius or Diocletian there are half a dozen Nero's and Caligula's.  Although Bush is particularly odious his policy is merely at the extreme of a narrow spectrum, as Chomsky acknowledges.  So a system run by an elite will naturally reflect the interests of the elite and not of those whom they govern.  Chomsky makes that very clear and that is one of work's best messages.  But what to replace it?

Lenin would have us believe that even a cook should be able to run a country, but I doubt most people would agree.  Jefferson also trusted the people, but was he too idealistic?  What should replace this corrupt polyarchy?  Although Chomsky offers no solution, it is still an important and informative work
