The original &quot;Fun With The Sun&quot; (1961) by Dan Halacy has been  revised and updated.    The section on building a box cooker has been  completely rewritten and results in a more elegant and easily built cooker.  The chapter on building a reflector cooker produces a more compact and  easier to handle unit but the construction involves a bit more work.    The  second half of the book is devoted to some excellent recipes. I have tested  several and found them to be very good.    This is an excellent book for  teaching anyone to use our most plentiful energy source
