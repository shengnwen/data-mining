I got this book hoping for some good &quot;base line&quot; advice. Well, I have to admit this book was a lot more complex than I thought a book on this topic would be. Usually, jazz theory books have maybe a page or two  dedicated to base lines. Well, this book is about 100 pages dedicated to  all kinds of drills for base lines, mostly the II-V-I progression.  Basically it's filling in base notes in between chords, using chordal or  non-chordal notes, in different time sequences. The CD runs through all of  the drills, which are mostly minor permutations of the last one played. I  was kind of hoping for a little more advice on how to construct good base  lines if you're using other types of progressions. And also maybe something  on how baselines relate to chords, pedal point, slash chords, or non-tonal  polychordism. Then again this is just a book on base line playing, so I  won't be hard on this book because this stuff is obviously very  challenging, and it requires a lot of practice, so this author decided that  this is the only way to go with it. Get it if you're into to base line  playing for old standards
