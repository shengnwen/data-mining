A fine translation of the meaning of the Quran and an excellent commentary upon it. Some may find some of the commentary controversial as much of Muhammad Asad's work writing is taken from the Arabic commentaries of Zamakhshari the famous Arabic grammerian and supporter of the Mutazilah or 'rationalist' school of Islam and the writings of the late Sheikh Muhammad Abduh who remains to this day a controversial figure because of his 'modernist' interpretation of some aspects of the Quran that traditional Muslims continue to disaprove of. 

Ignoring that, the commentary does reflect the beauty of the Arabic language and the traditions of Arab culture. It is unfortunate that it is not more well known and not taught as a study guide of the Quran in Islamic studies departments in the U.K. as it remains the only commentary (by a westerner) of its kind.
