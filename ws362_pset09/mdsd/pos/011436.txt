I found the book a great affirmation of what too often is the experience of Working While Black. True, there weren't solutions, but like reading the facts of a situation, provides comfort in establishing that you're not invisible and there's a larger institutionalized system at work. It helps when things such as stereotypes, discrimination, racism are being offered on a personal level as other than what it is, attempts to undermine your humanity and the equality of humanity.

It gave me relief, too, in its spins of humor. Yes, sometimes we have to laugh rather than cry. As far as not stirring people to act in one way or another, what the book does is provide an experienced insider's knowledge of how the system may play out. Better to know how things may play out than go in blindly believing race doesn't matter and that institutionalized racism isn't perpetuated within and outside the courts.
