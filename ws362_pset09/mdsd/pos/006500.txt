Each year I look for the perfect gift to give my mother,and 
each year she tells me my love is enough.My most special 
gifts are the stories of the lives we live along with our 
 family and friends.  Jack Canfield and Mark Hansen have 
 captured feelings and pieces of my own life.What more
 could a mother want than sharing lifes moments with her
 child,knowing they will live forever in a book.
 I am sure whoever reads this book, or other books written by
 Canfield and Hansen will have to agree.  There are stories
 in each book that hit very close to home or you feel someone 
 has been looking inside your heart.  Truly a book that can
 be read again and again and bring a smile to your face and 
 a tear to your eye. I feel sure A 3rd Serving of Chicken
 Soup for the Soul will be a welcomed gift, that is if I ever 
 get it wrapped!
