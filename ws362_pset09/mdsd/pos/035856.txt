For most people Polish history between the wars is probably a mystery. This book fills that gap admirably. It reveals how Jozef Pilsudski was truly the founding father of a reborn nation. This is his story just as  much as Poland's, but then the two are so closely tied together that  their's is one story. A fascinating and easy read. Thoroughly recommended  to those who have an interest in this area
