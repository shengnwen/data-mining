Kevin Phillips offers a comprehensive history of the Bush family and its activities at the nexus of US the oil, finance, and national security complex.  This is most valuable if one understands the Bush family not as a source of unmitigated evil, but rather as an example of the US class structure at work.  What is truly valuable in Phillips's history is the insight it provides into how power is wielded and major decisions are made.  The book is heavily footnoted so that the reader can refer to other resources to back up contentious claims or to further explore relevant subjects.

My major concern about this book is its unnecessary anti-Bush bias.  This bias may seem subtle to the sympathetic liberal reader or blatant to the conservative reader, but objective readers of either persuasion will agree that it is there.  The problem with this is that there is no need for this bias.  The true value of the book lies in its explication of how one family has benefited from the power structures inherent in US society.
