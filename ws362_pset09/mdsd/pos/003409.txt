I have read this book and the reviews on Amazon.com.  The author makes a good argument for enhanced cyber security in the USA.  This is an issue that will be ignored by policy makers and the general public until an attack makes people pay attention to the realities of a computer controlled civilization.  While other reviewers blast the writing style and hypothetical situations in the book it seems they have missed the point.  It is not if a devastating cyber attack will occur, it is when.
