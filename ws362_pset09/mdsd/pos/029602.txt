Greg Boyd is an awesome writer and this book is by far a "must buy" for all Christians, whether or not you agree with the Open Theism theology.  Since I DO attend his church, I do agree with majority of his theology, but our theologies should not be basing our "star ratings."  This book provides a CLEAR analysis of his view on the Bible.  This book provides a solid argument for the Open Theism theology
