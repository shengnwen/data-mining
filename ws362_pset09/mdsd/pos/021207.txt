I like Zit's, but it's scandalous that this and other Andrews McMeel books don't specify overlapping content. Sunday strips are colored. That aside, Crack of Noon contains nothing other than the contents of Thrashed and Pimp My Lunch. I wasn't happy to learn that I spent (not counting S&H) over $17 for what I could have had for $11
