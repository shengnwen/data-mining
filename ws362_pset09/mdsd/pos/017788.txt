Received this book in the mail tonight and truely didn't mean to start reading it.  I just started flipping through the pages, fully thinking it would be something I would read for this coming weekend.  But no Kim Corum dragged me into this story from the first page and wouldn't let me go.  There was only one scene I was truely uncomfortable with and that was the section titled Bad Girl.  I feel it really crossed the line.  A woman vomiting from a spanking definitely means stop.  In fantasy land, fine.  But in reality if your girl is doing all this to get away STOP.  You could go to jail.  Other than that, the rest of the book was riveting and thoroughly entertaining
