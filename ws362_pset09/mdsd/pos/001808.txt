Photoshop CS2 Workflow: The Digital Photographer's Guide is the best Photoshop primer I've ever read.  The author works through image adjustments in a very logical progression.  He begins with very simple edits and works his up to more complex fine tuning.  The instructions are both step-by-step and very clear.  He also does an excellent job of explaining the "big picture" of why you want to make these adjustments and does not just turn you into a mouse clicker following steps by rote.

If the book has a weakness, it is that it doesn't really live up to its title.  The book is not about workflow per se, but about all the steps that are part of a workflow. Only the first and the last chapters really focus on the aspect of trying to plan the workflow itself.  This is no crime, I don't know if it's even possible to fill an entire book with workflow planning discussions without becoming ridiculously redundant and useless.  But Tim Grey and his publishers chose to identify this as a workflow text and on that basis I think they have failed.  If they had named the book "Photoshop CS2 for Beginners: The Digital Photographer's Guide" I would give it 5 stars and my highest recommendation.  As it is, I'll still give it my highest recommendation for Photoshop novices as long as they realize that this book is really to help them with image editing skills much more than planning the workflow process itself
