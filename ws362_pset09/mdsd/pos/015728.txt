This book was about how to become a "minimilist". (In other words, get rid of all your material stuff, your ideas of "status", start to live simply, start exercising, and start saving, saving, saving!!) By building your "kitty", you're able to buy your boat with cash. It, too, was about practical stuff and a much simpler life! The only regret I had was that it didn't have any pictures! Other than no pictures-I loved it!
