It took me more than 100 pages to really get into this book but it was a good read anyway.  I felt Ross's return from the dead a little "out there", but still really enjoyed this book. 

Excellent writing, almost poetic at times and the characters were well developed. The fact that this is based on true history of eugenics in VT grounds the book a bit.

This is one author I won't give up on.  After having read My Sister's Keeper and Keeping Faith, I'm on to Plain Truth next..
