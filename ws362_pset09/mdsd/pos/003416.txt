Super senior sleuth Ivy Malone is spunkier than Miss Marple, with a curiosity gene that just won't quit. That inquisitiveness has gotten her into plenty of trouble, including murder, mayhem, and a place on a mini-Mafia hit list.

Now Ivy's headed across country with a stray cat and God as her only companions. But just when she thinks she's safe, two dead bodies turn up--discovered by Ivy, of course.

My mom loved books, especially mystery, so I cut my literary teeth on Agatha Christie. Mom and I discovered Mrs. Pollifax when I was in my teens, and she quickly became one of our all time favorite sleuths. I can't wait to introduce Mom to Ivy Malone.

On the Run is delightful, suspenseful, well-written and clever -- pretty much all I look for in a book.

Wonder if Ivy is looking for a place to park her RV. Other than the unsavory characters she brings with her, I'd love to have her stop by for a long visit.

I recommend this great read to Lillian Jackson Braun fans who will love Koop the quirky cat. Mrs. Pollifax fans will enjoy Ivy's choice of weapons.

I could go on and on. Bottom line: if you like quirk, mystery and three dimensional characters, you'll have a blast On the Run.
