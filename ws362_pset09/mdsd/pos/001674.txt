If ever a book screamed for a sequel, "Passion's Bright Fury" by Radclyffe is it! Introducing the dynamic Saxon Sinclair, chief of trauma surgery  in Manhattan, and the passionate Jude Castle, filmmaker extraordinaire,  Radclyffe has created two strong women destined to collide. 

Saxon's world is about to go topsy-turvy with news that a film  crew will be documenting the trauma unit, her new residents,  and her every move. The intense, commanding chief isn't too thrilled  to have her world on display and finds herself tangling with Jude Castle, the woman behind the project. Sax finds Jude not only a formidable opponent, but someone she is drawn to in spite  of herself. As filming progresses, Jude also finds herself in  the midst of uncharted waters....and unmitigated terror as flashbacks  to a traumatic event begin to surface. Secrets that Sax has spent her life hiding are threatening her resolve as well, and she finds herself breaking the number one rule: don't let yourself care. Will Sax and Jude break their own sacred rules and let fate draw them together? 

"Passion's Bright Fury" is one mesmerizing, fast-paced story that is better than an entire season of ER!  As usual, Radclyffe has outdone herself. All I have to say is  sequel, please
