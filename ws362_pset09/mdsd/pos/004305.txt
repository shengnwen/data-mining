I loved the story of Gary Erickson's journeys, both in his career and in his personal life, and found myself rooting for him and for Clif Bar at each step of the way.  The book is a delight to read, as well as an inspiration.  It shows that the little guy can win, and preserve his integrity at the same time.  This is the first business book I've found myself really looking forward to reading, both for its content and for its excellent production values: the design is stunning and greatly enriches the reading experience
