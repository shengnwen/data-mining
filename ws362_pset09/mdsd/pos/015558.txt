This book, the SMART guide to Mixing and Mastering Audio Recordings turned out to be a very good book about mixing.  There is somewhat less information than I expected about the mastering process, but I realize that mastering is probably best handled in a book of it's own.  The DVD accompanying the book is extremely comprehensive and very helpful.  Sometimes it is better to watch someone tweak in a particular sound or hear the effects of a mixing technique than simply to read about it.  A very good book for music production, highly recommended!
