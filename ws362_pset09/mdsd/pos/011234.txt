In TechGnosis, Erik Davis explores the relationship between the seemingly distinct worlds of technology and mysticism.  Through a nearly overwhelming number of examples, Davis attempts to illustrate how technology has been influential in religious movements from Ancient Greece to the cyber-cults of recent years, and how mysticism has shaped technology, especially in modern IT.  Throughout the book, he focuses on the similarities between the early Christian religion, Gnosticism, and the view of technology that our society holds today, citing the shared preoccupation with developing the knowledge to escape the troubles of the world.  The connections are not always completely convincing, however, because Davis tends to present parallels between the two forms of thought rather than true relationships.  Nonetheless, the book is a comprehensive overview of the progression of religion and technology, providing interesting accounts of alchemy, mesmerization, the early days of the Internet, and the power of science fiction and UFOs on culture and cults.  The book has a very non-biased feeling, as Davis does not advocate a shift towards or away from a certain worldview, or attempt to prove the legitimacy of any religious views like so many other books on the topic.  This makes the book feel a bit incomplete, as Davis simply presents a great deal of information and trivia that show similarities between religion and technology, without fully developing the implications of this similarity.  However, the book remains powerful and interesting, and is written in an absorbing style.  TechGnosis would entertain and educate anyone with an interest in the history and philosophy of technology, or mysticism and religion
