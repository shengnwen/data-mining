Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all.  The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series.  My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them.  Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time.  This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues.  I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly.
