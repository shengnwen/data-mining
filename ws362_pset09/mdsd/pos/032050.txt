An outstanding book. Gives all the insight into the life of an astronaut in training...and 
the politics that goes with the job. One of those books you can't put down. Eugene Cernan's narrative on his trips to the moon including the landing are outstanding. This book could be a #l best seller with more promotion. All the pressures that go with the job are unbelievable.
