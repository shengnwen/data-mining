The book itself is let's say an opulent spume of knowledge!! Mr. Temple deftly wrote his masterpiece and that is why I guess it looks so fecund for those of you who are voracious fans of all the space mysteries, aliens and stuff like that. The flux is shown as a really very ebullient thing itself and also it wakes up your hidden temptation to re-read the book repeatedly, again and again. I still have sort of a spiritual exaltation of mine and I suggest you to try it out and to read the book by Robert K. G. Temple called "the Sirius Mystery". Why not to open a new mystery for yourself?
