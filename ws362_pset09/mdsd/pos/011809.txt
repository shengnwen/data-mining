"Eight Weeks to Vibrant Health" provides both motivation and absolutely excellent, easy to understand information (better than so many similar books I've read) in a style that feels as if it comes from an extremely knowledgeable, wise and totally understanding good friend.  You will love reading it.  You will love even more the way you feel as you USE it. I recommend it to all my clients.  Mary Ann Michels, Certified Hypnotherapist & EFT Practitioner
