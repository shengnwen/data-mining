I am a classically trained piano teacher who has worked over the years to expand my skills to include faking off chord charts and jazz techniques.  This book is a logically organized reference guide.  I think, perhaps, it is not the best choice as a guide book for teaching yourself how to improvise.  It has very few examples of what the author is teaching.  Once I hit the polychord tables, my brain kind of seized up in the sense that I wasn't sure how to internalize them enough to apply them to my playing. (20 tables with 48 to 120 information blocks per table!)Again, an excellent reference book, but you should not expect to study and play your way through it without assistance unless you are already half-way there
