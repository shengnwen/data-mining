After having read many stories about the companies that are mentioned in this book, I appreciated the way the author was able to put things in context, and his in depth research allowed an interesting peek on the human stories that some individuals faces:

From the "lucky punches" (the story of the early PR coverage of amazon.com), to the difficult situation in which Greenspan found himself of either stopping the party or running the risk of letting it go to even higher levels of euphoria, I liked the way in which it provides details on how these people reacted or how they should have felt when they ended in the middle of the biggest speculative bubble that our generation has seen.

The space it devoted to stock analysts left me wanting to read more.. and IMHO the numbers frenzy that the author had providing details just before the crash was unnecessarily long and boring to read.

The book is somewhat old, and hence it misses interesting current phenomena (~Flickr, Youtube, and Google itself) but nonetheless it provides very valuable context on how the dot.com boom speculation happened.. and hopefully readers will get a sense of deja-vu whenever they find themselves in similar circumstances in the future.  As I was curious on that area, the space devoted by the author to the dutch tulip bubble and the japan real estate bubble seemed too short
