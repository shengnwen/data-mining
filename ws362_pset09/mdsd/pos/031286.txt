This is a fabulous book for the beginning witch, and one that you can grow with. It contains recipes for all purposes a beginner would want/need, and numerous recipes that I consider intermediate to advanced. (Please note that this consideration is from my viewpoint, and I am a beginner myself.) The section on substitutions by itself makes this book well worth the purchase price. Even though I am a relative beginner, my book is already dog-eared and well-worn from use
