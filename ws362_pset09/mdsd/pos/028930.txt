A wonderful story of Ernestine, a young inner-city Black girl who dreams of taking a trip on the train.  The story, appearing to be set in the 1950's or early 1960's, takes the reader into the daily life of Ernestine, exposing her hopes, dreams, and fears as she interacts with her friends and family.  Simple activities and how life without many financial resources was lived during the time period are brought to life.  A great book for Black History month or cultural awareness lessons
