This is a great book, easy to read and packed with ideas to help individuals make their mark.  Until reading MicroBranding, I had never thought of myself and how others see me as a brand.  Yet I am amazed at how T. Scott Gross' information pertains to all areas of my life.  In both my career and personal relationships, I have unique qualities and I need to be able to articulate them to others if I am to be successful.  T. Scott Gross also recommends that we develop personal mission statements to keep ourselves focused on our goals in life.  He gives lots of examples and stories and is quite entertaining.  Lots of great networking tips and ideas too
