To say this novel was a mystery does it an injustice, it was so much more.  A fully realized literary treat for avid readers of Lehane's Angie/Patrick series, or for just a casual reader in general.  You do not have to have experience with the other novels in the series to appreciate this one, though it does help immensely if you have knowledge of the respective pasts of Angie and Patrick in establishing their character for this novel.  Lehane tackles a tough, disturbing subject in a manner that makes you think.  There are no easy answers here and for readers wanting a neat, tidy ending, you will not get one in this novel. In that way it is true to life often.  If he had ended the series here, it would have been alright because nothing will ever top this novel.  I read somewhere they were trying to make a movie of it, and I will see it, but the emotional intensity of the novel will be tough to match when condensed to two hours.  To sum up my feelings about this novel, I will say this, Michael Koryta (young mystery author of some acclaim) credits this novel for turning him into a writer and making him want to write.  For those of us without the talent, this novel makes us wish for more, that we could somehow have penned Lehane's words as they are heartbreakingly true and real
