U2 by U2 is everything a fan would love.  I've been an avid fan for over 20 years, since July 13, 1985 (true fans will know what took place on that date). This book gives the insight I've always wanted about this wonderful group of musicians.  U2 by U2 gives the story behind every song from their viewpoint (unlike "U2, the Story Behind Every Song", a book which was not from the band's viewpoint). This book delves deep into the elements that formulated each song.  Whenever I listen to music, I always think of the mindset of the band and the way the song developed that led to its recording.  U2 by U2 answered every question I ever had about U2's work, and I enjoyed it immensely.  The band members revealed their human side in their extensive personal writings, and I fell more in love with them as a group having read this book.  The pictures in the book surpass any I have ever seen, including the pictures contained in Anton Corbjin's book, U2 & i. This book is a must have for every U2 fan.
