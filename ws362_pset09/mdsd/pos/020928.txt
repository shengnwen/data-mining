This is probably the best book about writing stand up comedy I've read. It really explains to you in detail not only how to write stand up comedy material, but how to write for sketch comedy and sitcoms. You can also get more jokes per topic with  Gene Perret's method than any other joke writing method I've seen.  This book in my opinion even surpasses  Stand up Comedy the book by Judy Carter, because you can get more jokes with Perret's mehod and it tells you how to prepare and overcome the dreaded writer's block, even though I do reccomend Judy Carter's book, I suggest you read Comedy Writing Step by Step first
