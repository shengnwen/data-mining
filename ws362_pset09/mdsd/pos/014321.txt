The editors put together an impressive pedigree of authors of the book's chapters. Foremost amongst these is Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations. He discusses how modern states still have a place in this era of increasing globalisation. Then Nobelist Amartya Sen asks how to judge its successes and failures. He suggests that it has much to offer. But also cautions that multinationals often prefer working in autocracies than in free wheeling democracies. And globalisation tends to deal in spreading capitalism rather than democracy.

Historian Samuel Huntington, philosopher Hans Kung and many others also give variant takes. More optimistic, though with qualifications.

You can ponder the essays as posing more thoughtful and measured views than many shrill screeds on the subject
