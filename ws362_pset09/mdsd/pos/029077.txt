This is a sweet simple story about the life cycles of daughters and their fathers that pull at your heart.

Although I originally bought it for my son for Father's Day, it made me cry remembering events with my own father who is now gone.  My son also cried when he read it to his daughter.  I recently bought it again for my son-in-law when he became a father for the first time...and he too read it with tears in his eyes.
