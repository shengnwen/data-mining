Spanish Verb Tenses is unquestionably good at presenting and explaining the proper context and sequence of verb tenses. Used only as a reference, this guide may be considered 'self-sufficient'.
If your goal is conversational ability and eventual fluency however, you will never reach that goal with Spanish Verb Tenses alone.  
I have been using Behind the Wheel Spanish 8 CDs and Text to actually learn how to speak the language.  The text that comes with Behind the Wheel is surprisingly complete, and even includes large verb sections (complete with illustrations no less) that break down the verbs (conjugation in a way).
The method used is non-grammatical so a grammar guide such as
Spanish Verb Tenses is ideal for use in conjunction with Behind the Wheel Spanish.
I am very satisfied with my progress in Spanish using these two
approaches.
