Toni Morrison shows off her major talent and her firm understanding of the evils of American slavery in this novel.  The story is a relentless revelation of how most slaves were treated by masters who considered them animals with human characterisitics.  The harrowing lives of major protagonists Sethe and Paul D ring true and arouse both shame and sympathy that human beings were demeaned and subjugated to provide profit and ease for white Southerners.   But, of course, that is an old story.  The question this reader considered after finishing the novel is whether this story needed to be told again, even by such a talented writer.  Of course it is similar in nature to a Jewish retelling of the Holocaust; therefore, I think it needs to shed some new light on the old story in order to be worth a reader's time.  I'm not sure this novel does that, nevetheless, it seems worth the reader's time because of the author's talent.  Morrison uses a poetic prose to tell her tale which, perhaps, suggests more than it details.  On the whole, it represents a worthwhile work from one of America's major writers.  Is Morrison as great a talent as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner?  No.  Is this the best American novel in the past 25 years?  I don't know.  I'd like to think there's something better.  Nevertheless, it is a fine achievement
