This is a classic book to be read by the young, and older folk, especially the former who may never have heard of a guy named Hitler.

I guess you can never satisfy everyone, and some people live to be different from the vast majority. They can say that they trashed Mr. Wouk or Hemingway or Faulkner...on-and-on. It puts them in the spotlight for a nanosecond, and gets people like me angry enough to write about their silly reviews in such forums
