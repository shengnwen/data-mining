Once in awhile a book comes along that strips away all of the pretenses and leaves you feeling like you actually heard from God as you read.  Buck Naked Faith is such a book.

Authenticity has become a buzzword in the christian jargon of the day.  This books goes deeper than using words, but points out what it means to develop a living, vital faith with Jesus.

The raw honesty and experience from which Eric Sandras writes ranges from the borders of humor to personal pain and points to a great God who loves to exercise grace.  

I'll never look at a Bonsai tree the same way again.

Well done!
