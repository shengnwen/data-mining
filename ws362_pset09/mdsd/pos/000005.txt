This spoof of superhero comics and their ubiquitous action figures is so darn funny it's impossible to get through a first reading without pausing to hold your ribs. But it has a Shrek problem: its best lines zoom straight over kids' heads and target Mom and Dad. 

This is welcome news if you're weary of countless nights re-reading Pooh or Seuss ad nauseum. But it's tough to explain to a toddler why the sight of a foot-tall plastic toy diving in a sink for the Lost Wreck of the Sieve provokes such snorts and guffaws. 

Traction Man's a Christmas gift to an unnamed boy, whose imagination turns him loose on unsuspecting household objects. But both meet their match with Granny, who knits the doll a puke-green coverall that fairly screams "dork." Picture the matching bonnet and it's easy to summon similar mortifying moments from your own childhood.
