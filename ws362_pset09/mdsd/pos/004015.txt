This book is one-of-kind: fiercely intelligent, playfully readable, uncompromisingly intellectual, technically dazzling and more. Byatt succedes in being able to so deftly straddle that razor-sharp boundary between writing a good book and making great literature that it almost makes me feel sorry for most other writers. The language snaps, the story strides confidently along, the characters develop in such a way that they seem to bloom organically rather than to be creations of a singule/ar mind and the plot has just enough twists, turns and surprises to make it an unlikely page-turner. Extra praise should be lain for Byatt's ability to perfectly summon Victorian poetic and epistolic forms and make them unite seamlessly with the book's wider, Postmodernist tone and philosophy. Of course, no book is without its faults, and this one probably has more than I would like to admit, but generally I found this to be an amazing book that I would recommend without hesitation.
