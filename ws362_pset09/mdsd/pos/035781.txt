In "Dwellings," Linda Hogan, whose last name is a type of home, showcases her uniquely feminist, naturalist, Native American perspective in a series of first-person narratives. Each addresses some aspect of our innate connection to the natural kingdom, either as an exploiter of it or a victim, like in fire and decay.

Hogan says caves are feminine, womb-like, and have the power to give visions and inspiration to those who dwell in them.

"We are welcome here. I love this inner earth, its murmuring heartbeat, the language of what will consume us. Above is the beautiful earth that we have come from. Below is heat, stone, fire. I am within the healing of nature, held in earth's hand."

Hogan's incisive, yet lilting prose yields nuggets of loamy golden-ness. The copy I read was dog-eared and underlined by its owner.
