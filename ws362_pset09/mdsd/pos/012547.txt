This book is a bit  of a paradox.  It is dead simple but quite complex all at the same time.  I have utiised the program as detailed in the book in its most simple form.  Follow the steps and see what happens.  It is a great guide and it works and that is why I bought my most recent copy as a gift for a friend.  However the basics are just the beginning.  In very simple language this book gives you access to a new way of thinking about "you & the world" and a vast array of quality sources and peer reviewed references to support and elaborate on the ideas presented in the book.  This book is the antithesis of most of the self help babble in the market place.  It's the product of research, clinical experience, time and results.  It's a great book that plots a simple path for those who need to find the space and time for centering their lives, once there, it gives them a framework and any number of directions that will enable them to anchor that tranquility in real time
