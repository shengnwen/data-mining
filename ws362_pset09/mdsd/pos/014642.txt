I have taken a class at the Gotham Writers' Workshop, and I highly recommend it.  My former teacher, Thom Didato, is one of the editors of this collection.  The purpose of this book is to give the reader (writer) an overview of the short story.  Sure, there are countless other anthologies of short stories out there, but those either reprint the same ones over and over, or they cater to specialized markets.  As it says in the introduction, "We've taken great pains to select stories that the general public will find gripping and entertaining."  In other words, these stories qualify as literary fiction, but they are not pretentious or boring.  There are a couple of classic stories here, by such authors as Carver, Chekov, and Hawthorne; but it is mostly comprised of contemporary stories that are only a few years old.

This book is a valuable guide to the state of the modern short story.
