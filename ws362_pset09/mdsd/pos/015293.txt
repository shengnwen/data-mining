By presenting a range and variety of categories that are both unusual and informative, this book assists the prospective student in defining particular schools of interest as well as increasing the number of schools to be considered. Due to its breadth, this is primarily a good book for conducting an initial screening of schools of interest. We encourage further research be undertaken before completing actual college applications
