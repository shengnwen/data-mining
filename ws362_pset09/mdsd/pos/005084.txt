Definitely, if you're thinking of reading this book, you should...regardless of race. It's an interesting read and has some true ideas in it, but if you're a non-Black, don't think it's representative of all Black people's ideas.

I've got to say that I have a few problems with Graham. Other reviewers have, more or less, echoed the sentiment that he's inconsistent, and this is true. However, I believe he's inconsistent in that he basically demonstrates he has shifted his life from one extreme (trying pathetically hard for the acceptance of Whites) to the other (going a little overboard on the idea of "Blackness"), and his discussing both in one book makes him look hypocritical and narrowminded, in a way. Here are some reasons why, in my opinion:

-I would say Graham DOES come across as having a problem with interracial dating. He even sits there and gives off a laundry list of famous Blacks who have had relationships with Whites, and the impression I get is that he feels as if all of these people are the kind who date Whites because they feel they are too good for Blacks, which is the main "guilty until proven innocent" type of assumption many Blacks will make when they see an IR on the surface and don't really know the people.

-I believe this is also the chapter he basically makes some comments about biracial Blacks, which I am. The impression I get here is that he believes that any kind of Black person is supposed to be 100% Black, no matter what their background is. He's one of those "one drop" type people, to me. His point about Jennifer Beals is well-taken--I'd never heard her say anything about being Black until she got on this show about lesbians on Showtime. Fine. That doesn't mean all biracials HAVE to just date Blacks or just identify as Black, which he jumped on her about commenting she doesn't just consider herself Black or something to that effect. Well, she's NOT just Black. Deal with it and quit insisting on labelling everybody one thing. Graham himself looks like there are Native Americans in his family, and probably Whites, too. 

-He basically makes it sound as if Black people need to live their life according to their race. All of our decisions and actions need to be colored by race. We are OBLIGATED to every other Black person...HAVE to date Blacks because we ARE Black...that kind of stuff, from the tone I get. I'm not going to let being Black dictate my life, and he obviously hasn't, either since he went to Princeton, Harvard Law and is very elite in comparison to the average Black. And if I get into Harvard Law, that's where I'm going, as well; I'm not going to Howard just because I'm part-Black just like he didn't go there. And I don't have an obligation to anybody except my family, in my mind. ANY person in need, though, I will extend a hand, regardless of race. I will do for someone who is Black because I want to, not because the Black race tries to tell me I HAVE to. If everyone else in the world was taught that, maybe there'd be less racism.

-Graham appears to be divisive in his thinking, not only of Blacks and Whites but also of Blacks along class lines. He said the different classes of Black people need different representatives, which is not necessarily a bad idea since I agree with him that Jesse Jackson can't do it all and not all Black leaders necessarily understand ALL the different problems facing different classes of Blacks. But it IS divisive of the Black community. There's nothing wrong with Black community, but I think it's different than letting being Black run your life like I said before. It makes him seem even more elitist. If you're going to be a true leader, if you don't know or haven't experienced the full extent of your followers' problems, it's your responsibility to learn and still represent, not separate us further by class. People who suggest Graham is talking about Blacks but are unsure whether he should even be talking are right because he can't represent most Blacks and obviously doesn't even care to nor want Black leaders to. 

-Furthemore...all of this stuff about IR dating and biracials, and yet he's trying to defend getting a nose job? He says, if I remember correctly, that if someone gets a nose job they don't need to explain and it's not necessarily about wanting to look White...but then he practically demands earlier in the book that Black people be 100% Black and entirely devoted to all of the Black race? And questions a Black person's motives for dating outside their race, even if they obviously belong to two races? 

Anyone who is so race-driven, at either extreme and definitely if he has lived his life on both extremes, has problems with THEIRSELF, in my opinion. He can't come to a middle ground on anything, and he seems like one of those people who--at the time of writing this book--is someone who has just discovered "the other side" of theirself...if you're Black, you know how it is when you finally start opening your eyes to all the injustices Black people have to put up with and how, at first, it changes how you think, maybe makes you kind of angry and suddenly consumes your thoughts, words, actions, etc. You get a bit extreme. That is somewhat Graham in this book--he's not angry, but he had obviously only recently started considering such things. For example, as I read passages to my mother, she just said, "I could have wrote that damn book." She acknowledged the truth of it, but she'd known it long enough for it not to be a big deal.
