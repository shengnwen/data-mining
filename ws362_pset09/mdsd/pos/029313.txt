This book gives a good start into portrait lighting. It covers a variety of techniques and gear. The only thing I wish were different is to see more photos of the lighting set-ups instead of the flat line drawings. It would be a greater help to see the height and placement of the pieces of equipment used. In some cases though it is more obvious than in others. All in all the book is worth the price for the new guys and gals
