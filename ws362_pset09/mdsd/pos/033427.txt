I found this book, thought provoking, moving, and real. The fact that it was written by a white author, and includes such profound insight of matters affecting the black community, is quite remarkable. This novel covers white black relations, inner black issues (political, family etc) forgiveness, blame, and love; all inter woven into a political thriller. You may not agree with all of the assertions of the authors, but the points he raises will cause you to review your opinions on most of the issues above.And that, for me is the mark of a great novel. Which this is.
