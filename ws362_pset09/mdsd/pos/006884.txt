This book is wonderfully written and definitely will give many people a better understanding of their pets.  It can teach you the basics of identifying behavior, training, life stages, as well as food and litter information.  However, due to the vast topics covered the book is unable to spend a great deal of time on details.  Consider this book a great read for someone just starting off with a cat, or who wants to understand them better, then grab something more in depth for whatever section you really wanted more in
