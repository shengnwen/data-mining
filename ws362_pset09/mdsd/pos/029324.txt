Gun Brooke is a talented story teller who has created four interesting women - two older, two younger.  Coffee Sonata is the story of how these four women come together to form friendships and love interests.  The four women are from very different backgrounds.  Brooke has the talent to make the reader believe that a world reknowned opera singer could fall for a coffeehouse owner and that a rich, sophisticated businesswoman would fall for a small-town reporter.

The connecting force for these women is music - not coffee as the title would indicate.  It was in Brooke's descriptions of the music that they create together that I think she failed.  Music is, under the best of circumstances, difficult to describe adequately without comparing it to another piece of music.  Since the women were creating something new, Brooke had nothing to compare it to, and thus failed to put the music in the reader's mind.

It would be interesting to read a sequel to this book to see how well the women fare in their new relationships
