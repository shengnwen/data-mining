This latest book (2005) on the 1973 Yom Kippur Way is easily the choice for someone interested in a full study from the point of view of Israel. The very confusing events are largely clarified. All the major players are presented in what appears more and more to be a defining moment in the history of the region.
If the information is largely predicated on sources from one side, it must be remembered that trustworthy information on the days events is still not all that available from Egypt. I have no idea what a historian could find in the way of accurate documentation about the conflict from Syria.
