First off, in the interest of full disclosure, I am the brother of one of the authors. Getting that by us, you will not find a better book out there on the subject of the Army's NIKE Ajax, Hercules and Zeus SAM systems.  This one contains system descriptions, drawings, maps, unit specifics and the locations of every NIKE SAM site in the United States as well as discussions of other similar missiles, including BOMARC and Air Force TALOS.  This book is a gold mine of information for those interested in Cold War history or for anyone who wants to know more about these nuclear-tipped missiles that used to surround our major cities.
