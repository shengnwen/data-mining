Catherine Hawkins, the mother of twin girls whom she abandoned at birth, has suddenly discovered she needs a kidney transplant, otherwise, she'll be on dialysis for the rest of her life. The doctors explained to her that her best bet is immediate family, or else she'll have to wait for a donor and that will be difficult because there aren't that many minority donors available. She tells the doctor she has no immediate family since both parents are dead and she was an only child. Then she remembers the twins. Catherine knows it will be a struggle because she has ignored the twins and has even told them she never loved them. Alisa and Ariana are graduating from high school. What a perfect chance for Catherine to reconnect and get her kidney!

Terrance Winston, the girls' father, and his wife, Jackie, who adopted the twins, are not eager to satisfy Catherine's needs. Catherine has disappointed the them so many times during their 18 years of life: she says she'll call and she never does or she says she'll see them for their birthday but never shows up. Terrance and Jackie realize the girls are now 18 and officially adults and can make their own decision, but they still feel the twins don't owe Catherine a thing. When the girls find out, what will their decision be?

WHAT GOES AROUND by Parry "EbonySatin" Brown is a real page turner as you attempt to find out what the twins, Alisa and Ariana's, decision will be. Whatever their decision, it has the capability of tearing a stable, loving family asunder. This was a sequel to The Shirt Off His Back but it is definitely a stand-alone novel. The characters are reintroduced and the background is sufficiently covered so that it can be read and understood with no prior knowledge of The Shirt Off His Back. The drama is earth shattering and engrossing. Brown presents both sides of the issue with skill and compassion. I would highly recommend this book to all readers.
