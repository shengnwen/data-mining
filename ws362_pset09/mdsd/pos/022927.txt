Don't let the long (boring) name fool you, it is a GREAT book! As our daughter is getting older (she is 16,) she is taking control of her diet.  I can't be with her all the time, so I have to teach her to eat healthy.  This might sound simple, but it isn't.  Well meaning relatives offer her foods she shouldn't eat, and others don't know that she has some 'nutritional issues,' like Celiac Disease.  Our daughter has to know what she can and can't eat, as well as portion control.   The DSNH not only has information for me as a parent, but it has worksheets and teaching activities for our daughter to help her learn healthy eating habits and good fitness activities.  Did I say that it is a GREAT book?  We copy off the worksheets and post them on the fridge, so our daughter can track what she eats during the day to make sure that she has 'hit' at the necessary food groups and water intake goals.  She even has her fitness goals for the week. 

The book covers nutritional information and needs from birth through adulthood.  Section three is the one that we are working on right now: Teaching Healthy Choices to Encourage Healthy Lifestyles.  It has everything from menu planning, to cooking and fitness.  It's full of readable and understandable information for me and hands on learning for our daughter.  That is a great combination if you ask me!

Our daughter will be the one in control of her own cooking, fitness activities and health in a few years.  This book will help me help her to make a smoother transition to become a more independent and healthy adult with Down Syndrome.
