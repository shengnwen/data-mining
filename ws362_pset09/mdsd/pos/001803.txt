The book has some really interesting ideas for boxes.  It is definitely worth getting for that reason alone.

This is not a good book for an inexperienced woodworker.  Many of the router table techniques shown are incredibly dangerous---I can't believe the author has gotten away with doing things the way he does without losing a few fingers along the way.  I shudder to think what might happen to a new woodworker who tries these techniques.

The projects described are somewhat incomplete and quirky.  One project, for example, has panel doors---the cutting list contains dimensions for the rails and stiles of the doors, but not the panels.  Not a problem for me, since I normally use these things as a source of ideas/inspirations for projects of my own design.  But for someone who is looking for a step-by step project guide, this will prove disappointing.  As another example, one project mentions using "brainerd hinges"--not a knife hinge, a slot hinge, a quadrant hinge, etc, but a "brainerd hinge".  But the author neither shows the hinges in any of the illustrations nor explains them in the text.   I was quite puzzled as to just what exactly a "Brainerd Hinge" might be and asked several woodworking buddies.  Nobody had any idea.  Finally, out of desperation, I "googled"  the term "brainerd hinge" and found out that there is a "Brainerd" company that makes hinges.  Apparently the author meant a simple butt hinge made by the Brainerd company.  The book is full of these quirks and one can either be frustrated at them or view them as part of the book's charm.

One final comment---many of the boxes appealed to my design sense, but some others seemed rather clunky in their proportions.  But that's easy enough to change on your own.  I say this to stress that the strength of the book is in providing a number of interesting design/construction ideas that can be adapted in many different ways.
