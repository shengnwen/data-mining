In the study of consciousness and what it means to be a functional and aware entity, one quickly realises that no single academic discipline is sufficient to even scratch the surface. Dr. Pickover's Sex, Drugs, Einstein, & Elves is a wonderful tour of what is currently being talked about, researched, and explored in the science of humanity, and yet manages to fool you into thinking you are doing nothing more than some light afternoon reading about, well.. stuff. The broad range of topics are skillfully woven into each other in a way that really makes the book accessable to anyone regardless of age, education, or experience. The fact that Dr. Pickover manages to keep a wonderfully vibrant personal tone throughout the whole book just adds that final element that makes this a 'Must Read' for just about everybody
