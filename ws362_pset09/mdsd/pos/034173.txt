Fact: The US of A was actually founded with
a three party, not two party sytem! The De-
mocratic/Republicans were once one party!
Fact: According to our Constitution, We
are a Constitutional Republic, not a so-called
'Demo(n)cracy! Former Congressman and Attorney
John W. DeCamp was a guest of the very fine
Radio Free America show of Tom Valentine many
times in the 1990's. He details how kidnapped
and runaway boys are used as sex slaves and
sacrificed in satanic rituals for REPUBLICAN
Sen(s) and Congressman at parties and killed
for 'Snuff Films', as in Snuffed out, as in
Dead. Drug Running, et, al, happens under our
noses, but the Phony "War on Drugs" ["Show no
Mercy" -George Herbert Walker Bush (The Elder)].
Waht a bunch of 'Bushlip'! Read this, Mr and Mrs
America
