Television, print, radio, etc. has long been the bastion of traditional media. That is, until the Internet became the tool of the people, allowing us to participate in content creation in ways never before seen. The masses have become less content in being subscribers to traditional media outlets; the Internet has become one of the major tools through which citizens have taken the idea of Journalist off its high pedestal and is helping us to reshape the very nature of who makes content and why it is important.

Dan Gillmor is a journalist of both traditional and new media, and his "Wethe Media" is an excellent study into how citizen's media is of growing importance in today's society. Gillmor uses a variety of relatively recent cases, such as the Howard Dean candidacy, and looks closely at how these instances are proving that citizens media is maturing rapidly and its tools will become the new face of new media. 

An excellent, easy to read bit of work, Gillmor has done a stellar job in the tradition of Reingold, Lessig and others in exploring and supporting the common man in the face of tradition
