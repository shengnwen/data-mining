I've only read books 1 through 3 at this point--'point' being a word which here means 'until now,' and by 'now' I of course mean 'then,' at which point I wrote this review, but then I remember that anything written is suspended in present tense, so I suppose my point is moot.  

This book is more like a work of literature than a good story told well.  That's not to say it's a bad book or that readers wont enjoy it.  If anything it shows that Lemony Snicket is a skilled writer worthy of emulation by developing writers (in the general sense that everyone is some kind of writer) in addition to being very witty.

I found myself wanting to smack the kids in the story over the head with a newspaper sometimes though.  The pace at which they figure it all out is really specifically aimed at a child readership so it's a bit frustrating.  The other two books in this series I read didn't have such glowingly obvious answers to figuring out Count Olaf's plan.

Still, good read, good book, just not as good as books 1 and 3
