Joe got it across to me in one sentence: "I believe our planet is what was described in an original Star Trek episode called "Shore Leave."..."they [Kirk, Spock et al] are on a planet that reads their thoughts and creates what they think about." Now, if you're not familiar with the concept that your internal world creates your external world, that's an 'out there' idea... Yes, parts of the book are redundant... and I'm not into all the spiritual stuff... but that's okay, because the concepts are simple and simply explained. Not to mention uplifting and inspiring. I love it. I've read it twice in a year now, and enjoyed it both times. Thanks Joe
