I adore Wm. Kent Krueger's Cork O'Connor series and didn't know what to expect from this stand-alone. Wow! This is a terrific thriller with so many surprising twists and turns, I had a hard time putting it down until I was finished.

Though very different than Krueger's other writing, this is an exciting read with marvelous characters! Highly recommended.
