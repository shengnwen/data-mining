Spy is an action packed, pulse-pounding thriller, "Bondesque" in the best sense. Ted Bell draws glamorous characters in stylish locals and  deftly fashions an exciting plot filled with more twists and turns than an all-day carnival ride. I was hooked from page one and I was truly sorry to reach the end. Highly recommended IN SPADES! :
