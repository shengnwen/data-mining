I am not going to include the plot and story of the novel, since it has already been done by many reviewers, quiet eloquently. 
I finished this book in a grand total of 5 days which i unfortunately did not have. I say this not ostentatiously, nor do i mean that i skipped many parts. I read every thing. But to read this book, and to thoroughly enjoy it, one needs ample time. Again, as already stated before in other reviews, it is a difficult read especially if the reader is a "novice". 1. because i openly admit that i needed a dictionary( which i loved) and 2. because a reader has to distinguish between important passages that actually contribute to the story, and some passages that are merely there to dissuade the reader from attempting to brave this epic book. 
The book is great, and is highly recommendable but i also had certain reservations. I did not understand why Mr. Umberto insisted on repeating many things in the novel. I can see why he would go over certain things to accentuate their importance,but certain times, i found it annoying as the same topic was expressed, only in different ways. 
I dare say this is a pseudo mystery book. As Umberto himself says, the mystery in the book is only half , if even, as important to the actual story. The mystery, though, also plays an important part in giving this novel an actual shape. 
Over all, excellent read. Read and revel in your intellectual glory.
