I happened upon this book in a library sale, and so glad I picked it up! The prose in this book is astoundingly gorgeous....poetry.

The details of everyday life in the period are vast, it's all intertwined in a bitter marriage and life of John Milton...told through his wife who was forced into marriage with him at 16...2 temperments so unsuited to one another. She loved another.

You'll love this gem of a book. I am surprised it is not more well known
