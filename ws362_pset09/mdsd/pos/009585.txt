In No Shortcuts to the Top, Ed Viesturs has given us an excellent account of what it is like to attempt to climb all of the world's peaks over 8,000 meters in height. He also explains how it was possible for him to do the huge amount of mountaineering he has done yet still make a living and raise a family. The climbing sections are wonderful. Like most people, I am purely an armchair mountaineer so books of this type are as close as I will get to going high in the Himalayas. Mr. Viesturs makes it clear that getting to the top is optional. As he says many times, getting back down is mandatory. I particularly appreciated his insights into the 1996 Everest disaster, and I found his descriptions of his attemts to climb Annapurna unbelievably gripping. This book also brings home to the reader how many of the best climbers eventually die in their mountaineering efforts. The book is also helped significantly by the editing and writing of David Roberts. He is one of the best in this field.
One other suggestion. After you finish this book, read Ed Viestur's Himalayan Quest. It is primarily a book of outstanding photographs of his climbs, and the photos should be more meaningful after you have read the descriptions of the climbs in No Shortcut
