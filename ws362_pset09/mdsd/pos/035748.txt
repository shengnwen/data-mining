As a poetry teacher, I was delighted to find &quot;Nathaniel Talking&quot; at the library.  It is rare to find fun and readable poetry about contemporary children that is also honest and serious.  I loved Nathaniel!   He raps, mourns his mother, views his father as a hero, ponders how heavy  the weight of the world must be and still remains childlike.  Well, done Ms  Greenfield!  The illustrations, as in &quot;Night on Neighborhood  Street&quot; are wonderful.  I hope that the publisher will make  &quot;Nathaniel Talking&quot; available for purchase again soon
