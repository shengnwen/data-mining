All I have to say is that i regret the fact that this is my first Jeffery Deaver book because this book is so fun and entertaining that I'm sold on Deaver and am looking to read the rest of his books. I read this book in two sittings because I simply could not put it down because I was so involved and really wanted/needed to know what was next. This story isn't about the reader trying to figure out who the antagonist is (you actually learn is identity pretty early) but is instead about the mind/computer games the good guys play with the bad guys and who will be one step ahead, and are they really ahead, or far behind? There are so many twists and turns in this book that you'll read it just as quickly as I did. I'm officially a Deaver fan now, and I recommend you pick up this book
