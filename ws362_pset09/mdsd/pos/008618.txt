As a ME fan for years, I was thrilled to get my poster book with Mary's Classic drawings, including my favorite, "Snap Out of It". I will be able to project my mood to co-workers easily as I hang up the different posters on my cubicle wall.  The quality is very high; the stock is substantial, not flimsy, and the colors are rich and vibrant, as they should be for Mary's work.  All posters are a standard 11x17 to fit in a frame.  I plan to use some in my ME room on the wall that can be changed out periodically.  I also got the Classroom Collection and the Christmas Collection.  Both had wonderful pictures I especially enjoy like "Believe" and "Books Fall Open, You Fall In". I expect to get many years of enjoyment from these terrific posters. They are easily removed from the binding and can be stored there when not displayed.  The cover is a very heavy cardboard and protects the posters well.
