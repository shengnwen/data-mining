Robin McKinley is my favorite author, and The Blue Sword is the book that started it all for me.  I was maybe 12 or 13 years old the first time I read it, but it has stuck with me for all these years, and is probably my favorite of McKinley's books (along with Beauty, the first of her two Beauty and the Beast retellings).  The Hero and the Crown, the prequel, is also excellent.

For adventure, magic, love, exotic people and places, and one of the greatest heroines in fantasy literature ever, there is no equal to The Blue Sword!  I only wish Robin McKinley would treat her readers with just one more Damar novel
