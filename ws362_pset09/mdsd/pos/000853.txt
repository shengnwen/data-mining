This is a great novel for anyone who has had a steady diet of Austen and Bronte.  The poor-girl-meets-rich-man-and-lives-happily-ever-after scenario and its variations are lovely if somewhat fantastical stories.  But they do get wearisome after a while.  I mean, after reading Sense & Sensibility, Mansfield Park, and Jane Eyre, one almost starts to believe that being orphaned and poverty-sticken is the surefire method of finding true love. 
Fortunately, Stella Gibbons felt the same way, and offered up this little gem.  While it follows the same basic recipe as all the other British chick lit of its day, my new best friend Stella had a little satirical fun with the ingredients.
A very brief, non-spoilerish synopsis:
Heroine Flora Poste, recently orphaned, considers her options, then blithely moves in with her cursed and dismally nutso cousins in the countryside.  Each of her relatives is almost cartoonlike in their complete dysfunctionality; and all of them need some serious "tidying up."  Luckily Flora is just the girl to take up the work.  There is the terrible and invisible Aunt Ada Doom, pious and furious Cousin Amos, morose Judith, virile Seth, sullen Reuben, and waiflike poetess Elfine. I won't ruin the ending, but the inherant absurdity of her relatives, mixed with Flora's matter-of-fact attitude about life makes for terrific amusement all the way through.
