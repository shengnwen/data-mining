The nurse's pocket guide is the must have of every nursing student. It is small enough to fit in your pocket, yet full of all the information you will need during your clinicals. This pocket guide is very handy and I highly recommend it. I purchased this pocket guide through amazon.com and received it with in 2-3 days. It was a very wonderful experience
