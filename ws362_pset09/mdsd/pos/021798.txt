This is an excellent book to give a foundantion of understanding in many areas of the occult. There are some areas that I disagree with Mr. Koch, but on the whole I feel he is on target in his assessments on the subjects at hand. Warning: this book does not give in depth analysis of any area of the occult, 1-2 pages is the normal
