I would have given it 5 stars except for the page that gives a part by part look at a girl's body, and has her bent over so you can see where the poo-poo comes out.  Strange!!!  I mean, it's illustrated and not a photo or anything like that, and it makes sense why it's there, but it still caught us off guard.  It made Daddy very uncomfortable when he was reading it to our daughter
