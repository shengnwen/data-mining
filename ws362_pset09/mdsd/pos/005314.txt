I have a confession....I don't think I could ever be a preacher's wife! 

Mikasenoja's novel revolves around Pastor and First Lady Stevens. As the new spiritual leader of New Light Church, Pastor Lance thinks that he has his hands full. However, he quickly learns that it is his wife who has her hands full. While he is ministering to his flock, it is his wife who is keeping the home fires burning. As the church grows in numbers, so do the problems. There are members of the church who are just not satisfied that the Pastor has chosen the right woman to be his First Lady and they are determined to help him see the error of his ways. While the drama, deception and long buried family secrets make this novel an enjoyable read, it the spiritual insights (check out the Prayer Map) that will keep the reader engaged from beginning to end. 

First Lady: Confessions of a Preacher's Wife reminds us that being a preacher's wife has got to be one of the hardest jobs on earth. A preacher's wife has to be humble, strong, spiritual grounded and she has to have a heart and arms big enough to embrace her immediate family as well as her spiritual family. Many are chosen but few are really called. 

Happy reading!
