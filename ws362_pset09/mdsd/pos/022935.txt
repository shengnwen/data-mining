I noticed that someone claims that Judy Brown has illegally published comedians jokes in Comedy Thesaurus.  I am one of the contributors to the book and I can say that I sent Ms. Brown 15 jokes, at no charge and with my permission, to include in her book The Comedy Thesaurus.  I have also contributed jokes to her book, Squeaky Clean Comedy.  I must say that my dealings with Judy have been a pleasure.  
All in all the Comedy Thesaurus is a great book.  Buy it
