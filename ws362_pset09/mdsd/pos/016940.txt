The Course of Honor is an engaging novel which elucidates the typical lifestyle of a Roman.  The love story between the two main characters, Caenis and Vespasian, is sentimental and charming.  The plot is entertaining.  The only part of the book that is dissatisfactory is that Lindsey tends to drone on and on about what Caenis sees in the city and what the current emperor is doing.  It is, for the most part, historically accurate and the main characters are real people.  Overall, I really enjoyed this book
