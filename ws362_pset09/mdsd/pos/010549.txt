This book is more autobiographical than specific to life-after-death evidence.  However, and even so, it's a charming read and details the life of Susy Smith entertainingly.

Having said that, many are more interested in Susy Smith's after-death experiments---the experiments she claimed she would conduct upon death, from the other side---sending a message or phrase across to prove life indeed existed beyond death.  These experiments have in fact taken place: 

"Immediately following the death of Susy Smith, 89 years old, the author of thirty books on parapsychology and survival of consciousness, it was possible to conduct two experiments to see if evidence of her continued consciousness could be obtained. Experiment I involved a single-blind design with an experienced research medium who serves as Chairperson of the Mediumship Research Committee in the Human Energy Systems Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Experiment II was partially blind and included two new research mediums who were blind to the name and history of the deceased person (Smith). The findings from both experiments provided strong evidence for the continuance of information about Smith. It is hoped that the publication of these findings will encourage scientists and spiritual leaders to bring Smith's afterlife codes experiment and the Susy Smith Project to the attention of mediums and students."

The Afterlife Codes is good read, overall, though not much information was given on the actual "afterlife codes" mentioned in the title.
