After I read this book, I'm fulfilled with the conclusion. As I read the story along I thought it will be ended with tragedy. However, the story ended with happy ending. I recommend this book because there are full of adventures which they travel each nations' city and it shows many conflicts. For instance, weather problems when they were in steamer, combat verses with the Sioux in the train, and personal conflicts. Those conflicts haul up the intense. The most impressive part was when Fogg and Aouda got married. For me it was sort of ironical because I thought Fogg's group was going to send her to her relative Hong Kong. Nevertheless, Aouda accompany Fogg's group which made Fogg and Aouda to build their relationship. Consequently, they confess their love which was romantic and touching part. Thus, in the ending they got married. Overall, I recommend this book. It shows full of amazing adventures with unpredictions
