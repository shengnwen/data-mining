If you don't already have an earlier edition,  this book is a must for any shooter,  collector,  or student of the history of firearms.  Since 1965,  Cartidges of the World has been the most comprehensive readily available source of information on the history,  uses,  and performance of rifle,  handgun,  and shotgun cartridges.  This new edition includes dimensions,  illustrations,  a short history,  and sample loading data for each of over 1500 different cartridges,  including virtually every significant cartridge introduced since the early 1870s,  with separate chapters on rimfires,  shotgun shells,  sporting rifle cartridges  from the United States and Canada  (with separate chapters for modern and obsolete), Britain,  and Europe,  plus handgun cartridges (both modern and obsolete),  military cartridges,  and limited production  "wildcat" and "proprietary" cartridges.  Covers calibers from 0.1 inch to 0.95 inch,  and cartridges as up to date as the 460 S&W Magnum, the 204 Ruger,  and the 338 Federal  (but not the 475 Ruger).  If the book has a weakness  (except for a few dimensional typos in tables and a totally incorrect photograph of an obscure British cartridge),  it is in its omission of many 17 and 20 caliber wildcat and proprietary calibers;  it covers interesting but uncommon  cartridges in 10, 14, and 19 caliber, whose future is problematical at best,  and almost all the new 50 caliber long-range target cartridges,  but ignores roughly half of the much more common 17 calibers,  and all but one of the  dozen or so increasingly popular 20 calibers.   (For these,  see Todd A. Kindler's The Sensational Seventeens  and The Terrific Twenties.)
