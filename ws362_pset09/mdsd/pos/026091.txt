This isn't a title that I would have normally said "Yes" to, but I was in need of an audio book and knew I could count on the endearing voice of this author, from his classic, A Walk in the Woods.  I was extremely pleasantly surprised at how entertaining this book was, about life in the 50s from a child's perspective.  This book is really about experiencing what it must have felt like to grow up during this rare moment in history when life really was simpler, sweeter, kinder, gentler, and filled with naievete about the realities of nuclear war, chemical pesticides, and other modern inventions that were just beginning to come of age.  Something I did not realize before was the fact that half the states in the US made it illegal to hire a married woman prior to WWII.  There are some incredibly interesting facts about American life woven into this charming and innocent tale which are lovingly shared.  Better than the movies, this book brings back all the nostalgia and charm as well as a dose of the strange but true from a wonderful, golden age.  The only downside to this book is that it can go on and on a bit where it could have been kept brief, but all the better for relaxing by, when you are treated to this wonderful tale on audio book
