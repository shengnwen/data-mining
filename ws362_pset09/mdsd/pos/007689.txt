As a pediatric nurse practitioner working with teens, I have seen the increase in self-injury over the last couple of years; most common is cutting. Strong does a tremendous job of conveying the feelings and emotions that I often hear the girls and boys I care for reiterate.  With a section by Dr. Favarro who has done countless studies and publications on adolescent cutting, this book is highly recommended for any practitioner trying to learn more their patients, parents trying to understand why their child is self-injuring, or anyone who is interested in the world of self-mutilation. Thank you Ms. Strong for a commendable resource on SI.
