This book provided a quick reading and interesting perspective into the lives of men we all grew up knowing as corporate "giants"; perhaps the first American corporate giants. 
Not a drama; just a well supported story of how these two men made more money than can be imagined on the backs of working men at the turn of the century.
I found it a worthwhile read, and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in history, giants in America, or anyone that simply wants to know a little more than our normal history books offer about these men
