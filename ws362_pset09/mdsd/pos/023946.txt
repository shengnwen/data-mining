  Once again, David McCullough's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind. This biography reads like a fascinating novel, and McCulloughs narrative ability is unmatched. No one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can. 
  The great Theodore Roosevelt, known throughout the world and across the ages as an incredibly strong, tough, larger than life figure actually began as somewhat of a weakling. The book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage, the man who would become President of the United States.
  Best of all is that McCullough likes and admires his subject. This is not always the case with biographies. Roosevelt and his family are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Highly recommended, as are all of McCullough's books
