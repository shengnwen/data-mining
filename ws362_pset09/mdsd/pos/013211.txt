Uma is  not the only superstar of the Thurman family. Robert Thurman has long been recognized as  one of our leading scholars on Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan culture.

This book is be read to the deceased shortly after death to remind the  deceased to keep focused on the "clear light" to avoid  rebirth and if rebirth cannot be  avoided to guide the deceased  to be reborn into the best possible situation. 

The one of the secrets of the Tibetan Book of the Dead is  that it is as much for the living as it is for the dead.
The demons that devour the various parts of the body as one travels through the bardos try to frighten the dead and distract them from focusing on the clear light. They are similar to life's "demons" that distract us from our purpose and the work and path we have selected.

A great translation of the classic work.

Highly recommended
