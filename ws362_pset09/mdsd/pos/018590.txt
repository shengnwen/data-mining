   I don't often write fan letters, Ms. Blackstock, but I felt compelled to send this one today.
   Regrettably, I was not familiar with your work (even though I read some 40-50 books a year, and have over a thousand volumes in our home library) until my daughter urged me to consider reading your books. I respect her judgment, and began "Private Justice," from your "Newpointe 911" series a few weeks ago. 
Today I finished the final installment, "Line of Duty," of your five-volume series. It was the 46th book I've read this year (yes, I do keep a log!)... and your "911" series accounted for five of the last thirteen. This, hopefully, conveys the extent of my interest in and appreciation for your writings. 
   Please accept my congratulations for having developed an extraordinarily unique style... combining tales of interest and excitement, with characters who become real persons; and blending in your compelling spiritual messages in a manner which brings the John Grishams, the Mary Higgins Clarks, et al; together with the Max Lucados, the Philip Yanceys, and the Lahayes. 
   So, again... Congratulations!... On your creative writing talents, your development of suspenseful plots and characters readers come to know intimately... and especially for bringing your inspiring messages to many readers who may not otherwise seek out books dealing solely with your sincere dedication to The Nazarene. 
   I wish for you continuing success... and for many more Terri Blackstone series to come!
