I thought PICKLES TO PITTSBURGH was the sequel to CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS, but I was somewhat mistaken. The children from the first story do visit Chewandswallow, but only in a dream. The illustrations in this book are just as original as the ones in the first. However, the story is lacking and doesn't have the charm of the original story. Young children don't seem to mind that, though, and like reading the stories back to back. If you're familiar with CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS, you maybe disappointed somewhat after reading PICKLES TO PITTSBURGH. However, if you're just looking for a book to read to kids, it's a good choice
