I found this edition by Penguin to be very useful for a casual reading.  The notes on the poems, in particular "the Waste Land," are detailed enough to give the reader a perception of Eliot's vast literary knowledge and its effect on his poems.  However, the notes are inadequate if your purpose is to deeply understand the background of Eliot's complex and difficult poetry.  So if you are looking for deep insights, I would recommend the Norton Critical Edition.  For the normal reader, this is satisfying and straightforward
