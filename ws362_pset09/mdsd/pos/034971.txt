I found the book to be very enlightening and was quite impressed by the scholarly approach of the authors, particularly their discussion of the origin, history and development of Black English in this country and in the Caribbean area. For example, their explanation of the substitution of d  for th in spoken soul, their term for Black English, because there is no  th sound in the West African languages used by the black slaves in early  America provided a clear basis for this usage that made good sense to me.   That explanation dispelled any pejorative notions that this pronunciation  was due to some kind of laziness of tongue or simple-mindedness on the part  of the speaker.  The book is very well organized, well written, and  introduces the reader to the many uses to which Black English or spoken  soul has been put in music, humor, poetry, novels and the theater.    Although it is a scholarly work, it flows quite smoothly and is easy to  read.  The discussion of Ebonics and the actions of the Oakland School  Board is must reading for anyone who followed that controversy.  It puts  that whole affair and the medias role in it in its proper context.  I  bought a copy for one of my colleagues and another is reading my copy.    After finishing the book, I had a greater appreciation of my own home  language.  The book is must reading for anyone interested in having a  better understanding of the multi-layered society in which we live, the  beauty and richness of the languages we speak and the contributions speaker  of soul have made to the beautiful mosaic that is the United States
