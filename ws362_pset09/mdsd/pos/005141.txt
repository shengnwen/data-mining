This has been one of my favorite musicals since when I first sw it in  1991. It tells the classic story of the beloved novel by the same name. The  music is lovely and the whole thing has a mysterious air to it, something  never really done in a Secret Garden movie or musical before. I like it.  All the lyrics are wonderful and the songs have a wonderful tune too. It is  neat to be able to read all the lyrics and all the spoken words. The  original cast recording of this musical has some of the spoken words, but  not near all of them. It is a nice way to re-live the experience. I highly  reccomend this book. If you like this book, you may also like the original  novel &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; by Frances Hodgson Burnett and the  original cast recording of the musical itself
