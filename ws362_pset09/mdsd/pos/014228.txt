I found this book in a used book store years ago, and I am so glad I picked it up! It started off rather slow, but as soon as Erin meets the First Servant of the Dark Lord it became such an unsually compelling love story. Most of the book is a dark and rather tragic romance between Erin and Lord Stefanos. They can't help but be both repelled and fascinated by the conflicting nature of the other, as they find themselves compromising what they've always believed in to be together. It took me years to finish the series because books 3 and 4 are so expensive, but if you can get your hands on them, I recommend all four- they don't disappoint. These are the types of books you can't let go of even days after you finish the last page.
