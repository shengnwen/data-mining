I felt sad when I had finished this book, for there is much wisdom in it.  I resisted it for a long while, finding flaws everywhere, but finally had to succomb.  The story is told through the letters of one woman from Appalachia, Ivy Rose.  She is perhaps wiser and more in tune with the 90s than a woman born in 1900 in the hills should be, but it is a glowing book, alive with the beauty of the Cumberland mountains in western Virginia.  It was never the events she describes in her letters that were important - it was the writing of them.  The author may be using this as a metaphor for our lives.  It is never what happens that is important, but merely the living of it.  For so much repeats itself through the generations.  It is a wise, wise, book, engrossing and entertaining. Alive to the last page.
