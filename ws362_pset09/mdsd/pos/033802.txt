The editorial book description encapsulates the delights of this book well, but misses one major point.  While the book may seem addressed for little girls to help develop and strengthen their self-esteem, I think it's also important for boys to be exposed to that message.  Teaching boys that girls are beautiful, strong, equally deserving of love, respect, nurturance and acceptance, is a message that should be delivered from an early age and to all children--boys and girls alike.  Two pictures and lessons (e.g., "I'll learn about life from other points of view" and "Decisions will be made with thoughtfulness, kindness and care"), in particular, were especially noteworthy values that I only wish the adults (and political leaders) in our life took notice of more when they were young.

One word of caution:  The book is bigger than most board books and the material is not as strong.  This book may be better appreciated by kids 2 years old and above.  Otherwise, be prepared that the pages may rip from curious and anxious hands as they turn the pages
