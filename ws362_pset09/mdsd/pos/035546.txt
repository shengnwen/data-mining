Please take our fellow readers' nay-saying with a grain of salt.  If you are a serious reader of History, I guarantee you will get something from this book.  Hoffer presents a very illuminating introduction to American historiography as a predicate to his discussion of the curious cases of Ambrose, Bellisles, Ellis and Goodwin, and while he doesn't go easy on them, he is in no way mean-spirited in treating with their respective indiscretions.  Indeed, his well-documented (and concisely written) description of their misdeeds raised more ire in me than it apparently did in him.  Guess I have always been naive enough to assume that when I pick up serious works of History by respected authors, I am getting the benefit not only of their independent thought and analysis but of their research integrity as well.  I for one will never read another such book without wondering whether and to what extent it is "original".  Hoffer's obviously is, and is well worth the read.
