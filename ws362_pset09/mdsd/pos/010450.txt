The first time i read the book, I was less than enthused.  Though most of the charecters were thoroughly developed I thought that it lacked a sufficient plot.  I felt that it was unconnected and confusing.  It may have been because I read it during a large time period, perhaps because I was busy with other things, or maybe I was simply mot paying attention.  However, I changed my opinion the second time I read it.  Since I knew the plot and the charecters, if even on a basic level, I was able to pay more attention to the details in the short passages, and in the dialogue.  I found that the plot was twisting and involved, as were all of the charecters.  Deane does do a great job with detail and description, this mostly because of his poetry.Though it is not the best book I have ever read, it is worth reading.  It is entertaining and also involved.  I would be tempted to buy another book by Deane, should he decide to write one.  All in all, it is worth reading, but twice at least
