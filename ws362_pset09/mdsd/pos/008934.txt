The information Ms. McCartney shares in this intriguing volume provides valuable insight to seeking and understanding yourself. I have studied with Ms. McCartney and have experienced the lessons in this book firsthand. This process has helped me to uncover who I really am and what I want to do with my life. If you don't live in the Bay Area and cannot attend the Academy of Intuitive Studies and Intuition Medicine in person, this book and the companion tapes are the next best thing. You will learn a compendium of tools from a variety of disciplines, including those developed by Ms. McCartney herself, that can provide ways to find deeper insight into your life and purpose. I cannot recommend it highly enough
