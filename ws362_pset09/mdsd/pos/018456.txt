Stephen King is a master storyteller.  And he proves here, as in other short story collections of his, that, be a thousand pages or ten, he can still terrify the reader.  This, King's earliest collection, is also his best.  What never ceases to amaze me is King's ability to take completely ridiculous concepts and make them truly terrifying.  For instance, some of the stories in this book concern demonic trucks, a possessed industrial laundry machine, killer toys, and a race of mutant rats.  A lesser writer wouldn't dare to try and make these into realistic horror stories.  But King's talent for embracing that which is campy and cliched in summary, and rendering it into a bone chilling reality bears witness to his genius as a writer.  Several of the stories from this book have been made into very bad movies:  The Mangler, Sometimes They Come Back, the Lawnmower Man, Children of the Corn, The Boogeyman.  Yet the original short stories are pure miniature masterpieces.  My personal favourites are The Ledge, Quitters, Inc., Graveyard Shift, Gray Matter, The Mangler, and Night Surf.  Truly, shorter is not lesser with Stephen King.
