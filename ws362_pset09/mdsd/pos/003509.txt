This book was written with a detail and consideration for someone who has MS. It is a book that explains medicines, gives the bad and good, gives information about resources available to people who have MS and practical information on exercise, practical physical information and is all given with respect for the person who has MS.  It has great insight into all foreseeable problems of someone with MS. Although it takes care to explain mainstream medicine, it doesn't reject a person's right to try alternative medicine.  Some of this stuff in this book is available elsewhere, but it is great to have reminders under one cover. 

I don't know the authors, but they did a great job.  Since I was diagnosed with MS years ago, I read every book on MS. This book is going right on my kitchen shelf with Judy Graham's book and Swanks Diet book for MS.
