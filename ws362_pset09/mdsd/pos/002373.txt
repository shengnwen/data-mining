First, I have to note that if you have not read "Black" yet, I would suffest that you read that before you read this book. It would help to clear up many references in this book that would otherwise be very confusing.
After reading "Black", I had no idea how the series could possibly continue because Thomas was dead. However, when I started this book, I realized that it did not actually say that Thomas was killed. In fact, you learn that Thomas escapes death one more time, however I won't ruis the story by telling you how.
Basically, this book gets off to a very exciting start and rarely slows down at all. This is a very enjoyable read that can keep you flipping pages into the night if you aren't careful. I found it hard to put this book down, and you probably will also. If you have already read "Black", then you should be used to the strange themes found in these books, so opefully that won't put you off.
I enjoyed the part where Justin is revealed for who he really was. I actually found myself thinking that Rachelle was being decieved by trickery when she first began to trust Justin. However, as the scene unfolded, I began to see the parallels with the Biblical account of Jesus dying for us and soon realized that Rachelle was right and that Justin represented Jesus.
One of the few downsides about this book is that it has no real underlying truths or any real point to it. The only thing that I can think of is that what we do on earth affects more that just our lives here. However, apart from that, it is just a good piece of fiction.

Overall, this book is awesome. It has a few negative points, but they are minor enough that you don't think about them until you are thinking the book over once you are done. They do not really detract from the book.
I highly recommend this book as well as both "Black" and "White", with "Black" coming first and "White" third. Read and enjoy
