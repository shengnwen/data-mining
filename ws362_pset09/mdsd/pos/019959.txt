As Harold Bloom, the critic, notes, Sun Also Rises is maybe the only Hemingway novel that these days doesn't seem like a period piece. Many of his stories are still great of course, especially the short ones like A Clean, Well Lighted Place and Hills Like White Elephants, which focus on a snatched fragment in a bar, or by a railway station to illuminate huge life truths. 

Over the long haul, Hemingway's style can often suffer. His terse, precise, hard man style often lags in patches over his novel length works, and at his worst he comes across as a dated, third rate social commentator. Not in this book however, Hemingway's first novel. His portrayal of wealthy, feckless expatriates in Europe in the 1920s is magnificent, with beautiful scenes crafted in sparse prose describing wet Paris streets and bars, the dusty heat of Pamplona and the tension inherent when young men travel in the company of a seductive woman. 

This short novel is a natural pair to Fitzgerald's masterpiece, the Great Gatsby which contains characters who are similar in many ways to the people who populate Sun Also Rises.
