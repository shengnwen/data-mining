I founds the chapter on her illness and how she coped by putting the needs of her children first to be especially moving.  I enjoyed the book immensely; she has a great writing style and is passionate about her subject.  Don't be put off by the word "housewife" or the unearned reputation the author has of being "anti-feminist".  She is a strong advocate for women.
