This was my first Erin McCarthy book to read and I have never laughed so much at one sitting.  The plot was quirky, the heroine not perfect (deaf) but also not passive and the intimacy scenes were hilarious!  All of the characters, including the cat (Ferris) were realistic and most were amusing.  This was a fast-paced, enjoyable read that had me hooked from the beginning; it will not be my last McCarthy
