There are plenty of expensive packages out there, promising to have your child speaking a foreign language fluently in -however-many-weeks/months- but 'German for Children' is probably THE best option for any parent wishing to introduce a child (aged 3 to about 9 or 10) to the basics of German. It's fun and child-friendly, with lots of chirpy songs and games, very little writing (while encouraging older children to read along and keep a German notebook), and no complicated rules of grammar to learn by rote. My boys are 5, 6 and 8, and love playing 'Wo ist...?' and 'Bingo', and singing along to the 'Pizza Song'. I doubt the pack would be of much interest to children over 10, but for the younger ones it's definitely five stars
