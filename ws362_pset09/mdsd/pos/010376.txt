The 47 Ronin Story by John Allyn is a wonderful book and is easy to read also. The paperback has a feel to it that makes it readable, yet when you've finished you feel full; content. The amazing (and true) story of these 47 Ronin really makes an impact on the reader and also challenges them, because it makes you ask the question, 'What is honorable?' Some of these samurai became drunks and whore-mongers simply to avenge the honor of their lord. Is that considered right? Does the end really justify the means? With such a revered history in Japan, the story is a must read for anyone who has a love for the Japanese or Samurai culture. The book has depth, it has feeling, and by the end you might feel tired from going on such a journey with those warriors. A wonderful book for a great story, I highly recommend it! :
