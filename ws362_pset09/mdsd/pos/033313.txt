I came to Amazon to purchase a copy of TALES OF THE KINGDOM by David and Karen Mains.  There were several reviewers that were disappointed in the illustrations of the newer editions.  So, I sprung the extra money to buy an older copy.  BELIEVE me, the old illustrations by Jack Stockman are only "fabulous" if you have some childhood memories to make them special.  Otherwise, they are rather ordinary and do little for the stories.  The stories themselves shine and shine.  Such excellent stories.  If I had to do it again, I would buy the newer edition and save my $$ for other books
