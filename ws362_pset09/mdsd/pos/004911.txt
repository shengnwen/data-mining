Enter W.T. Melon Elementary School and join the third-graders in the classroom at the end of the hall. Some very odd things happen in that special classroom. Mr. Leeks, the custodian, tells everyone who will listen that he hears noises coming from inside that room, even late at night. Once, Mr. Leeks was outside cleaning and looked through the classroom window only to see someone sitting at the teacher's desk! Mr. Leeks promises that he saw the ghost of W.T. Melon sitting there, plain as day, teaching an invisible class. Of course, that is impossible since Mr. Melon died over twenty years ago. 

While you read about the third-graders in the classroom at the end of the hall, you will watch nine kids have some amazing things happen to them. For example, Roger is the class Pain-in-the-Neck. But after a visit from a dust genie that changes. Then there is Emily who is a very tidy girl, except for her desk. When a desk pest makes her desk his home, she changes her ways. Let us not forget Kenneth either. He finds reading to be difficult. But a magical book that tells the future makes reading a joy. 

***** Nine tales grace this book's pages. Each story is accompanied by wondrous illustrations that will bring any young child's imagination to life. This is perfect as a first chapter book for pre-schoolers, if parents have been helping their child to read early. Most kids will be able to read it by first or second grade. Parents would do well to purchase this book and read one story (one chapter) to their children before putting them to bed. It not only makes for wonderful bed time tales, but also help the kids get an early start on reading. The stories are so delightful that children may ask for a story from this book, instead the normal ones. Very well done! Highly recommended! *****
