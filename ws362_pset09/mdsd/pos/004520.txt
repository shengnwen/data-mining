This book, or manual (37 8 1/2 x 11 pages), is about as close to observing first hand the process of gilding picture frames with gold leaf you can get without actually attending a watergilding course which are few and far between and expensive. I still would have preferred more detail, even if it risked some repetition.  I have several books and manuals on the process, but this addresses important areas in the process more effectively.  The book also includes metal leaf gilding in a separate section.
