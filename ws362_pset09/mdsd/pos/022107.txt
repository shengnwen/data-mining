Forget about the big attractions, like Disney, this short book offers the unique and more personal attractions.  Perhaps your interested in the first McDonald's (California), the first Steak-N'-Shake (Illinois), or White Castle (Kansas), or maybe Kentucky Fried (In Kentucky of course!).    Maybe your interested in the biggest ball of twine (several states boast of this), or miniature models of towns.   Each of the fifty states is introduced by a "Greeting from" postcard (but at less than 1 1/2" by 2 1/4" I wish these would have been bigger).  The appendix identifies many of these from Curt Teich Postcard Archives that collectors will recognize.   There are pictures of unique hotels, cottage courts, and such as "Wigwam village", and I would have enjoyed having these pictures/cards dated.   Readers of this will also enjoy his Motel Americana web site.
