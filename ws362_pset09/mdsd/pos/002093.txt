This is a good book, about a boy who goes through many hardships,and much happiness with his two best friends, Ol' Dan and Li'l Ann. They were very special friends, not only because they were extremely cute, kind, and willing to do everything the boy, Billy, wanted but also because they were dogs! And they were loyal 'till death. It is very sad, and happy at the same time. Even though it was sad, it is still one of my favorite books. I really enjoyed it.
