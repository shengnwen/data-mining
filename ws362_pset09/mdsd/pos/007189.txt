Brian Greene has done an outstanding job in this book explaining physics to the average person. He leaves out the formulas and equations and uses analogies to explain complex theories. He explains the following:
1).Spacetime
2).Worm holes
3).How and why time flows
4).Everthing Quantum
5).The big bang
6).All about String theory
7).M-Theory
8).Teleporters and time machines

If you want a user friendly book on physics this is it. It is not an easy read but the effort is worth it if you are truly interested in the fabric of reality
