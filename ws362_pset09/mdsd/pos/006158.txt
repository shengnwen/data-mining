In a few decades muslims will turn Western Europe into an islamic continent. This book goes into detail explaining why this is happening and how. The peoples of Europe deserve what ever happens to them for allowing millions of a foreign and unassimilatable people move into their home land. This book doesn't leave much room for optimism either. I recommend this book if you have an interest in the future of Europe or the Western World.
