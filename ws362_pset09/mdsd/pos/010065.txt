Nice cook book. I will use many of the recipes. Since I have to watch my fat and cholesterol intake I have always a keen eye on the food analysis. This cook book provides to each recipe a food analysis which should be read with some suspicion. Three examples: (1) Stuffed Fillet of Sole on page 168: the amount of cholestorol is rather 60 mg than 6 mg. (2) Chicken Cacciatore on page 204: Cholestrol is rather 96 mg than 20 mg and the fat is closer to 7 g than 2 g. (3) Pot Roast with Vegetables on page 248: Cholesterol is rather 142 mg than 68 mg. Use the book but watch the analysis
