some facts: dimensions 1.57 x 11.22 x 8.82 inch actually, printed on  acid-free paper and made to last, containing 275 articles averaging to 3  pages per article, typically 1 to 4 pages. Apart from the normal table of  contents there is a.o. a thematic t.o.c. and a glossary with definitions of  600 specialized terms for the benefit of the general reader. Every article  has an extensive reference section to facilitate further reading on the  subject. The articles themselves are rather scientific, if you can hack  this sentence from page 1 ''... both taxa share maxillae with subvertical  ascending rami and cervical vertebrae with hypertrophied epipophyses ...''  then this book is for you. Every 'difficult' word is contained in the  glossary, but that still doesn't make it good bedtime reading, even more so  because I do not find the book heavily illustrated. The illustrations are  mostly b&amp;w drawings, diagrams or photographs, with only a few pages of  full color photographs or art-work, I estimate that more than half of the  pages have no illustration at all
