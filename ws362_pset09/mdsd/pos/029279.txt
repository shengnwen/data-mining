The characters present at the opening of the book are the young curate, Belinda, and Harriet.  Harriet's manner is blunt and jolly.  Belinda and Harriet Bede are sisters.  Neither has married.  

Belinda loved the archdeacon when she was twenty.  The archdeacon is miffed because Lady Clara Boulding attends the church of a rival, Edward Plowman.  Lady Clara is the daughter of an earl and the widow of a member of parliament.  The archdeacon tends to hate the garden party as an event.  

Edith Livesidge, one of the local residents, is probably called splended because she is tough and wiry and is apt to dig vigorously in her garden.  Agatha Hoccleve, wife of the archdeacon, has very good clothes.  The servants call the archdeacon the Venerable Hoccleve.  Lady Clara Boulding is to open the party officially.  Opening parties is her chief recreation.  Edward Plowman thinks the archdeacon enjoys showing off his knowledge.  

Next the wife of the archdeacon goes off on vacation and the sisters, and probably everyone else in the village, take note of the leave-taking.  Harriet has a tendancy to spoil all of the young curates.  This becomes significant to the plot in two ways.  First there is the marriage of the current office-holder.  Then there is the visit of a former young curate who, amusingly, has managed to become both a bishop and a missionary to Africa.  

During the absence of the archdeacon's wife, his friends, librarians, Mr. Mold and Dr. Parnell, pay a visit.  Harriet and Belinda have a very successful dinner party for them and for others.  Harriet receives a marraige proposal from Mr. Mold, which is declined.  The bishop later proposes to Belinda, and that too is declined.  Belinda explains that she is not in love with the suitor.

The star of the novel is Belinda.  She is kind, dowdy, and self-conscious.
