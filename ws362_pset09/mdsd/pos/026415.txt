This book, Island of the Blue Dolphins, is written by Scott O'Dell. Personally, I thought this book was pretty good, just  not the best in the world. I rate Island of the Blue Dolphins about 4 stars. It is about a girl named Karana who lives on an island shaped, as described in the book, like a fish sunning itself. 
   In the village of Ghalas-at, Karana encounters strange ships coming towards the island. It was the Aleuts coming to hunt otter. Her father, the chief, lets them make camp until  they are gone, as long as he gets half of the otter. However, they do not give him his share of the bargain and the village has a fight. Most of the village dies.
   Later, ships come again. This time, they take the people from Karana's village and take them to a different place. Karana's little brother is left behind, so she dives into the water and stays on the island with him. Her brother unfortunately is killed by the wild dogs. 
   She stays on the island for about 18 years encountering many different obstacals. Will she ever be rescued? Will she reunite with her village? In order to find out, you must read this book. I hope you like it
