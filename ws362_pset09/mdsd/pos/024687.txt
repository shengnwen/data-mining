I have read a large number of traditional literary works and a few items of modern writing in recent years. And, of the many works of contemporary literature, the work Grendel stands out as one of the most interesting and innovative in construction and plot. 
	Gardner has created a work with an interesting variation of style. At various points, the work goes from standard narration into modes of poetry and play. This can make for a more interesting read but it can also cause a degree of confusion for less experienced readers. But, on the whole, this feature adds positively to the book. The book has a somewhat interesting way of going about telling the original Beowulf tale. It is completely narrated by the primary villain of Beowulf, Grendel, and follows him from his birth, to his early life, to his inevitable demise at the hands of Beowulf. It is also interesting that the work has twelve chapters with one representing each period of the zodiac.
	The book is written on a very deep level. If one wants to pick something up for a light read, I would recommend that he chose something else. But the work is relatively short and "word efficient" and goes by quite fast so it doesn't seem at all tedious. Because of all of these factors, I would highly recommend the work to any advanced reader who wants to try meta-fiction
