I started reading this book by Hillerman, and since it seemed familiar I had to check to make sure I hadn't read it before (by checking if I had written a review on it somewhere). I oculdn't find the review, so I finished the book.

I've stated again and again why I love Hillerman's books. The only problem with them is they do tend to become so like one another to raise the feelings of deja vu in the reader. this was the one I felt that way with most. Otherwise, it was a good read.

In this book we see Chee breaking away from Janet as their differences become too much to overcome. We learn more about Bernie, a young officer under Chee, who bugs the daylight out of him in many ways. And once again, Chee and Leapheart are forced together to solve a very 'cold' case that was considered a suicide and not a homicide. And they need to work together to see that justice is done, not only for the family of the man, but for his wife and for the community in which he chose to live.
