Theodore Sturgeon was really bold and brave advancing gender and sex issues in the tame 1960! Love the description of the strange society and the ever-intriguing finale. This book predates Left Hand of Darkness of Ursula LeGuin and the Wraeththu series of Storm Constantine.I'd have appreciated less socio-anthropological dissertations and a more dynamic plot. The "everyday's life" inserts are really dull and uninteresting. But the time-travel story and the description of the androgynous Ledom is perfect! Charlie Johns' reaction on apprehending the truth reveals the age of the book, but for some aspects it is still shocking
