According to this book women are spoiled, self centered, feminist, sob's who moan and complain and blame their husbands for absolutely everything, and thus ruin their marriages and families, and make themselves miserable too. Men are portrayed as simple minded creatures who helplessly and impotently take all the abuse. The solution, according to the book, is for women to drop the self centered feminist act and build rather than destroy their families by accepting and appreciating their men largely as they are and by offering praise, acceptance, Victoria's Secret costumes, and sex to please their men, and, to get what they (the women) want in return. 

While I don't think one can over estimate how harmful feminism was and is to love, families, and children it is too simplistic to blame it all on feminism or even other recent cultural developments given that the divorce rate, for example, began to rise very noticeably long before feminism; probably do to the economic development that diminished a woman's need to be a part of an economic family unit. Moreover, while I think it is important to hector women as only Dr. Laura can to effect an attitude change (from feminism to love) I can't imagine that alone would be sufficient to compete with a social movement as deeply ingrained and cataclysmic as feminism. Accordingly I highly recommend a book called "The 91% Factor" which also explains why women are so miserable in marriage but is very specific and yet very simple about what women can do sexually to improve their marriages without having to love husbands who they believe are stupid, wimpy creatures who must be manipulated and controlled.
   Most interesting, if not stunning, about the book is that it is a credible female bashing book in an era of male bashing that very successfully began 45 years ago. Whether you agree fully or partially, it certainly gives you an independent perspective from which to see more objectively how conditioned we have become to the social changes that occurred in the 60s.
