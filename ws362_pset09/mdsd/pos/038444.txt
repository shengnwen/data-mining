I would recommend this book for quilters and history buffs.  I'm only giving it four stars instead of five because I found the writing a bit repetitive in places.

It's true that this account is pretty thin with *written* evidence, but I think we have to remember the danger of the Underground Railroad here.  It certainly was perfectly normal *not* to leave written records that could only harm people.  I was surprised at many of the other reviews here which discount the importance of quilts in the Underground Railroad simply because there is no wealth of written documentation.  We are dealing with an oral tradition here.  This hardly takes away from its importance though.  

My grandmother, a proficient quilter who was descended from abolitionists, told me about the idea of quilt codes used in the Underground Railroad.  I was interested, but assumed all these years that it was just a family story of ours.  Imagine, then, my surprise finding this book
