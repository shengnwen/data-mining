There are four books in this series and you MUST get em all! 

First book is about a Japanes family near end of WWII whose father was anti war and realistically oriented man and criticism of rich people who plunged nation in war.

Second book is about a guy who walks through bombed Hiroshima and horror that  A bomb can bring.

Third book is little more cheerful since it describes urchins who fight for survival and will to live blooming in greatest poverty and inhuman condition.

Fourth is conclusion and has very sad at moment, but is OPTIMISTICALLY ended
