As I started to read the back of the book, it caught my attention and it seemed very interesting.  I thought the book was very good because it always kept me wondering and as I read on, it would get more interesting.  This book was about a detective trying to find out if the crime committed was a murder or a suicide.  I also thought that the secrets and deceptions is what kept me interested and wanting to go on further.  I couldn't put the book down because as I read on, I would find out new and more twisting things.  Something else that I liked was how all the characters had something in common and how the author related all of them.  The thing that I also liked about the book was that I always thought I had the murder solved and figured out, but finishing it up, it had a really twisted ending and that is what I liked most.  I liked how the author wrote is so that you would think one thing and be so positive that it was true, but then he makes it so that there are other points of views.  I liked the way the author used so much detail because it gave me sense of what the characters looked like and I could picture in my head the actions that were happening.  Over all I would recommend this book to anyone because of it's mysteriousness and the way the author wrote it was great
