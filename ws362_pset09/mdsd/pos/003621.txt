In a recent trip to Tuscany we were able to take one of the walks described in the book. This was definitely one of the highlights of the trip.  When used with a good map, the directions are good. The trails are easily traveled (my map had many other trails, but some of them were overgrown) but not overused (we did not see any other tourists the whole day).  Following this guide helped us see a side of Tuscany we would have missed otherwise, and gave us stories that made other friends who have visited Italy jealous
