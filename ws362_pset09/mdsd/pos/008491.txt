Anne Perry writes a Christmas story each year - this offering features a young couple, Rev. Dominic and Clarice Corde who arrive at a village for Dominic to substitute for a cleric who has left abruptly. They are a loving couple want to do their best for each other, and do the best they can for their parish. When the 'vacationing' reverend is found dead in the cellar of the house, Clarice and Dominic set themselves to find out who murdered the rev.. It is a good whodunit, with the shades of the Victorian Era life. These Perry books feature members from the Monk and Pitt series - such as Lady Vespasia, Charlotte Pitt's mother, Henry Rathbone - now the Cordes (Daniel was Charlotte's brother-in-law whose wife (Charlotte's sister) was murdered in the first of the Pitt series, Cater Street Hangman. Pitt solved this murder.)
I read this book in one sitting. I am a fan of Perry's. and think this book will be enjoyed by all -
