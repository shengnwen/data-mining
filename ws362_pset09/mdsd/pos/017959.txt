Great fun. Dickens' first novel, the first mass-market best seller in world history (coming on the heels of the invention of cheap paper). Essential reading for Victorian Literature and the evolution of Dickens' style. This edition (with footnotes and introduction, two appendices and maps) is fine in all respects, except that the print is too small
