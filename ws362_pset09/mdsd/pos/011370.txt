This book was the perfect book to prepare my 3 year old son for our upcoming plane trip. The pictures perfectly depict what it's like at the airport, including the waiting areas. We talk about what the people are doing, where they're going, and what's going on. Also, the pictures themselves are so colorful and fun to look at that it completely captures his attention
