My 7 year old son has enjoyed reading this book (and having it read to him) many times. We also find the game-playing tips very helpful as we work our way through Oracle of Seasons/GameBoy Advanced. 

It also includes some nice color pictures of the key characters... which is why I only give it 4 stars... wish there were more illustrations!

Highly recommend this for any young reader who likes to determine his own storyline
