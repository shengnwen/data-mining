The images on the cards are beautiful, full of symbols, and really speak to me. I've had other decks and I've never been drawn to them the way I am with Shapeshifter. The layouts that were designed for special use with the deck are very good as well. Easy to learn and remember because they made sense and really went well with the cards in the deck. My particular fav is the polarity spread. I seem to really gain good insight into the issue at hand and into my feelings about it when I work with this spread. I highly recommend this deck!
