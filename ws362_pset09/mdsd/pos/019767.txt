This is one textbook I wish the teachers of each of my children had at their disposal. It provides a great foundation for helping teachers focus on developing conceptual understanding of the key mathematical ideas K-7. The only drawback is that many of the great ideas for activities presented in the book are too small to be copied quickly by busy teachers; however, the richness of ideas and strong links between various type of representations make it well worthwhile despite its steep price.
