This is the fourth Harry Bosch book that I've read and it is by far the most personal.  This time, Detective Bosch investigates the one crime that drove him to join the police force: the unsolved murder, in 1961, of his own mother.  

As the book opens, Bosch has been suspended for attacking his supervisor, Lieutenant Harvey Pounds (who has made appearances in previous Bosch novels) and is required to attend counseling sessions with police psychologist Carmen Hinojos.  Although initially reluctant to bare his feelings, Bosch starts probing the childhood wounds he suffered as the fatherless son of a prostitute, who was forced to spend the bulk of his childhood in McLaren Hall. Despite his ongoing therapy, Bosch engages in a series of self-destructive actions which nearly torpedo his career. As Bosch grapples with painful memories, he methodically solves the case -- and other, related murders, including that of his mother's pimp, Johnny Fox.  In the process, Bosch uncovers early-1960s corruption and comes face to face with detectives, prosecutors and criminals of that era.  

Once again, Connelly does not disappoint.  The story is well-crafted, with a surprise ending that is unexpected, but makes sense.  As always, the description of Los Angeles -- now and then -- is spot on.  Another fine page-turner
