Though not as chock full o' combat as the previous installment -- and certainly not as the first volume -- this third volume of the Aubrey-Maturin series is nevertheless a stunning accomplishment.  Don't get me wrong:  there's riveting combat, but it's not the focus.  O'Brian's concern here seems to be plot and character development.  The subplots that get advanced are the respective romances of both Jack and Stephen, and we get deeper insights especially into Stephen, who -- much as I love Jack -- is swiftly becoming my favorite of the duo, not to mention one of my favorite literary creations of all time.  In short, this is an amazing read, and the ending (I won't give it away, but the book is aptly titled) can't fail to leave you moved and thrilled
