Myself being a huge fan of the Buffy TV series, I was eager to read the books. This was the first book I read in the novel series, and boy did it intrigue me. I couldn't put this book down, I wanted to find out what happened, I wanted to see how the characters either died or recovered and I wanted to see the climax of the movie, how it finished and why the story even came about in the first place. The title Power of Perusasion is very good, I think it means many different things: the power of the Buffy books and their sense of persuasion that makes you want to read more Buffster stories. The power of persuasion, the power of the villains, how they persuade the regular Buffy characters to become almost unearthly. And finally, the power of the intrigue of this book. I was seriously enthralled in the plot, and had a sense of persuasion to keep reading. If there is a flaw its that the way the villains die is not exactly clear enough, but this is still a highly recommended read
