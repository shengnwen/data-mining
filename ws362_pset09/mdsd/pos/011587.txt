Waldo's Sacajawea is probably one of my all-time favourite books, so that's why I decided to read her series on Madoc.  Although this book didn't grab me in the same way, it is still a very well-researched story about a little-known time and a historical person that not many know about.  Her descriptions are very real, and in this book are actually quite graphic because the subject matter truly reflects the way that things were back in the 11 century.  Life was short and terror, fear and superstition ruled all.  I also found that the women in the book, especially Brenda, are very well drawn and they are truly remarkable and memorable.  I think Ms. Waldo captures medieval Wales and the passions that drove men and women in these dark days very well.  We laugh with these people, grieve with them, cry with them and love with them.  That in itself is a sign of good historical novelist.  Don't be daunted by the size of the book, or by some of the reviews.  If you love historical sagas, then this book is one you shouldn't miss
