King's second novel, I think, and I still enjoy it. It feels classic, but still a great read. I had lost my hard cover of the original, so I bought this thinking, "Bonus, illustrations." Well, if you're buying for the illustrations, save the money. They're black and white photos by a photo-artist friend. They have little/nothing to do with Salem's Lot and are certainly not worth the steep price tag. Mind you, it's the only way to get a hardcover version new, so by all means if you're a King fan. I have all his books hardcover, now, so that's good news. Maybe I should have gone for that first edition used cloth I saw for only $1200. Oh well. Still a good, entertaining novel. Kingisms are here a-plenty, and his strong voice has emerged. It's Dracula revisited, and King admits as much. I did find the "boy and the man" less engaging than I remembered it (at the beginning of the novel), but once he hits town it flies along at a great ol' pace. Pure entertainment. The characters are okay, not as good as later novels (or Carrie) but it's still fun. Early King, very nostalgic for that reason.
