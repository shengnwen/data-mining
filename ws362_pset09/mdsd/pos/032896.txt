Sun Tzu's work, "The Art of War," originally written sometime in the period of time from 400 to 300 B.C.E., has experienced numerous revivals in popularity over the years. During the 1970s it was popular with students of the New Left when the study of guerrilla warfare was in vogue. In the 1980s, "The Art of War," reappeared in quite different company. 

In the 1980s and early 90's "The Art of War" was often carried in the brief cases of corporate raiders, who quoted from it liberally to explain their view of the corporate world into which they had entered. Note that the characters played by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen in Oliver Stone's 1987 movie, "Wall Street" are pictured quoting Sun Tzu's "The Art of War," and Wesley Snips in Kevin Hooks 1992 movie, "Passenger 57"  pictured reading the book in the plane about to be hijacked.

Although this volume translated by Samuel B. Griffith, published in 1963 by Oxford University Press, with a forward by B.H. Lidell Hart is not the only translation available, obviously. In addition to the entire text, the volume also contains an appendix with significant additional material on the influence of Sun Tzu down through the ages. I had found James Clavell's version quite difficult to find, but well worth it - due to clarity of reading and balance. I tried reading Cleary's version, but could not get through the first chapter. However, I did purchase "Mastering the Art of War" by Cleary; finding it a better tour guide. Clavell's "Art of War" offers tactical insight on overcoming an opponent whether it be war, work, relationships, or your own personal demons. 

Sun Tzu created a timeless piece of history written for the future. I personally feel that today's society needs to look back, master the art of war, in order to repair the future. I recommend you read it and see how a book can be so popular after 2500 plus years written can be so respected!
