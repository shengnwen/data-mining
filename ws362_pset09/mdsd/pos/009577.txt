This book is a fast, fun and an informative read. Regardless if the stars are doing these at home tricks and bargain beauty buys are true; these beauty secrets work. My girlfriends and I have been doing them AND THEY REALLY WORK. We have saved money by using many of the products that are recommended. Plus, we have had fun girl-time doing it. I am prone to acne, so the trick of washing with my face with plain yogurt has made my skin smoother and helped with cleaning up my pores. I do it once a day.Bye bye acne pads. Useing baking soda with my actual face wash every few days,WOW, better than facial scrubs. By the way, a box of baking soda is $1.29. I used to love a face dermascrub kit from a top company that is over-the-counter for $25.00. Cha-ching a lot of money saved.
