This is the one that you'll keep after the class is over.  You'll come across some odd methodological issue 5 years after you buy the book and it'll be in there, explained perfectly.  The section on interpretation of  interactions is particularly great.  You can't learn more about power and  meta-analysis more efficiently than by reading the relevant chapters in  here.   The ethics chapter is more entertaining than anything like it in  any other text.  I've been teaching from this book for 9 years and still  get students calling saying thanks for making them buy it
