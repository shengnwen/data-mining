This is one of those books that inspires, enlightens and provides a detailed insight into the wisdom of those who founded and have guided this nation to greatness. Would make a great book for  the Leftocrats to learn what the principles and wisdom America was founded upon.  I only gave it a 5 star rating because that is the max you can give. This book surpasses all books of comparable nature.
