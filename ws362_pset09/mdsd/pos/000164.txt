I do not know how I stumbled upon this great autobiography, especially since it is very rare that I read autobiographies.  However, I was engrossed in the book.  I wanted to continue to read until the end.  I thought the book was insightful and very thought provoking.  Moody did a wonderful job describing The Movement and all that it involved.  Although I was born in the late 70's I still found it interesting to read about something that still affects us in some way.  Moody writes about a time period when African Americans struggled in hopes that a change would come, and in some instances it did. During Moody's time African Americans were trying to overcome many obstacles and we are still trying to overcome some of those same obstacles today.  Nonetheless, I think this is a great read, especially for those who were not part of the "Struggle."  I would recommend this to anyone, Black or White.  Moody did a great job with her work.
