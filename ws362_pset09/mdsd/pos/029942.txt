I actually read this novel, as well as all the other novels by Boris Akunin featuring Fandorin, in Russian because it is my native language. I loved tham all. This book (in English translation) I bought as a gift for my English-speaking friends. They read it already and said they were impressed by this story and would read all sequences, which made me very happy
