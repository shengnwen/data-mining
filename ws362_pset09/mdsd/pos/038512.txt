This books certainly brings back memories of games played on the playground at recess.  Although some of the words are different than I learned them, as expected for such widely used rhymes, I recognized quite a few.  One disappointment was that there is no indication of the music to go with each rhyme.  The authors did not provide an indication of the notes to sing or even that it sounds like a common song.  Also, there are some lyrics that are inappropriate for young children and others that are very sexist or condescending.  This book is not for everyone and I would certainly not hand it to a young reader without editing it or carefully supervising the language used by the children
