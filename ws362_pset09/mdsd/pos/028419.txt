Years ago I wanted to learn how to apply cosmetics properly. The natural look on this book's cover attracted me so I bought it. It turned out that this book is far more than how to make a natural look. The beauty tips are organized by several very sensible categories: 1. process: step-by-step makeup guide; 2. Makeup recipes tailored according to how much time you can afford for a make up: 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, or 20+ min; 3.Beauty tips for females in different age groups: 20s, 30s, 40s...till 100s; 4. Tailored makeup recipes according to your skin tone and hair colour.

Other very useful information like how to organize your makeup tools, plastic surgery or not, etc. are also provided.

Finally Ms Brown also does not forget to remind you beauty is not only about hair, face, skin and figure. It's about healthy life style and healthy attitude toward yourself and the life. 

All in all, this book serves as a very good makeup reference to me. And I like Ms Brown's attitude toward the makeup thing. Anyone whose main interest is not in makeup/fasion but still want to appear polished in public should get this book.
