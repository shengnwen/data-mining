&quot;Final Account&quot; is the story of Keith Rothwell, a mild-mannered accountant who has been brutally murdered, execution-style.  Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, with the help of his colleagues, investigates Rothwell's shady business dealings as well as his family and social contacts.  Banks discovers that Rothwell's life was a great deal more complicated than the police could ever have imagined.  Once again, Peter Robinson has created a fascinating character study of a man whose outward appearance is deceptive.  The book has many wonderful qualities.  It is full of colorful Yorkshire characters who are brought to life in exquisite and entertaining detail.  Robinson's descriptions of the beautiful English countryside are lovely.  The mystery is satisfying although the ending is a bit far-fetched.  I especially like the character of Inspector Banks,  who has always been a man of contradictions.  He is compassionate towards victims, but he can be ruthless and cruel when necessary.  Although he loves his wife, he all but ignores her when he is on a case.  He has little formal eduation, but he has a deep interest in music and literature.  Banks is one of the most interesting of all the British detective heroes and &quot;Final Account&quot; is a fine mystery in the Inspector Banks series
