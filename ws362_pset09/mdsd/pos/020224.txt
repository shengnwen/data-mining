Douglas Freeman presents the life of Robert E. Lee well from his early days up through his last days at Lexington.  Interestingly enought, some of the most intriguing stories are from Lee's days fighting in the Mexican/American War.  After finishing this book, my first thought was to pick-up a book on that conflict. But that's not to say the rest of the book lacks the same insight, and indeed, its interesting that Lee's biggest flaw appears to be his &quot;gentleman's way&quot;.  It would appear that if Lee were more like Patton, the outcome of the Civil War might have very well been different.  Unfortunately, by the end of the book it becomes very evident that the author can't seem to come up with enough glowing characterizations of the General and the overly God-like descriptions become old and make one wonder how accurate the character judgements were.  But regardless, the book is very well written and enjoyable/informative to read.  Any person who has a budding interest in the Civil War must read this novel.  Its well worth the investment in time &amp; money
