If you, like me, felt bogged down in formal economics courses in college, trapped by bewildering formulae and graphic mazes, you've found your introduction to economics.  This is not to say that Dead Economists is a college text, though it could be.  This is an educated reader's brief introduction to the history of modern economic thought.  Buchholz brings to life old ideas, as advertised.  Even though somewhat dated from the 1999 revision, it rings with currency.  I most enjoyed the author's essay on John Stuart Mill.  Buchholz moves quickly to put important ideas in a historical and biographical context. This style resonates with a reader like me, and if you felt as I did in school, it will with you too
