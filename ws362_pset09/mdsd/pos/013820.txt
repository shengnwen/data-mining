        Homer Price by Robert McClosky  was a great book. Iliked how every chapter was a whole new story. Homer always finds himself in some kind of mystery and always gets an award for finding out the mystery. Iloved the book. It was great. this book has a lot of description. I never could stop reading this book. I would HIGHLY recommond this book to anyone who likes mysteries.
