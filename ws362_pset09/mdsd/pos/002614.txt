I tried this for 9 days while on vacation and I was amazed by the results. All of the bad vision habits that Dr. William H. Bates discovered I had. After a few days practice, I was having "flashes" of perfect vision discussed in the book. I was seeing details like leaves on trees rather than a big amorphous blob of green. 

The downside: I need more than nine days to get fully functional because I can not drive or do my work with out corrective lenses. I am sure if I had a few months in a place where I did not need to drive or work on a computer I would get to near 20/20 vision based on my experience in 9 short days. I was definitely reading news papers in 9 days with out glasses and was starting to see detail at greater distance. 

The overall book: While there is a lot of ophthalmological and physiological information about the eye that you don't need to master the Bates Method, I found this information very instructive and important to include. Thomas R. Quackenbush did a superb job, and the book is well written with lots of detail and outstanding pictures and illustrations. 

If you are young and your eyes are starting to go bad, read this book before ever wearing corrective lenses. The Bates Method will probably reverse your vision problem while the "medical industrial complex" will snare you for life with glasses and lenses
