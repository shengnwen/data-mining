However, it's a good starting point for beginners. This is not a book for intermediate or advanced designers as the material will seem obvious. For beginners he gives a good soft introduction to basic concepts so you'll wind up having an idea of which direction to go after you finish the book. He also introduces you to basic terminology and practices. When you're just starting out, you don't know what to ask because you don't know the terms.

Given all that, I would not pay full retail price. It's not exactly a value packed book. I read it in 3 days, so I'd buy it on discount. It's not worth retail
