Although I'm only 14 year old boy who lives in Utah, I've been a die hard Stephen King fan since I was twelve, and I have to say, this is really the high light of his career.

Don't be turned off by the massive length of this book, it goes by very quickly, and you'll be glued to it bye the first fifty of so pages.

As I'm sure you know, this is a coming of age story about seven children who together must face an evil that has plagued them and even gives them personal grudges. Other people have already gone over the basic story, but one thing that most of them failed to mention that I find very important is that after their child hood encounters with it, all of them But Mike Hanlon lose every memory they ever had of it.

Yes, this book is vulgar, it is violent, and there is some sexuality, it is an essential part of the story. It is over a thousand pages long, and each page is genius. I will go to my grave saying that this is the greatest book I've ever read, because it's so much more than a horror story. I think this book has greater characters than any other book I have ever read. This is a five star book, and is almost completely flawless. This is my favorite book, and some of Stephen King's other great works are The Dead Zone, Misery, The Shining, and Christine.

Read this book, it is well worth your time, I won't go in depth into the story, because hundreds of other people already have, but this book will scare the piss out of you, make you reflect on your childhood and the friends with whom you shared it, and really just change you. I can't express in words how great this is, but don't take my word for it. Buy it, rent it, whatever, just READ IT (no pun intended).
~Love, Dallas~
