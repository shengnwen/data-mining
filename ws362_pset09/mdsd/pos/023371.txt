What's the first thing you want to know about a country?  Why do I want to visit.  For answering this question Insight guides do an excellent job.  Interesting descriptions complemented by pictures get you interested in Chile and what the country has to offer.  Comparably Lonely planet guides are like a phone book.  There is more information in them - often out of date -  but little effort or detail is put in about the features of the country itself.  My only problem with Insight is that its informational section is lacking.  My suggestion is read insight, determine where and when you want to visit and then seek out up to date information on hotels, etc. from another source
