Hard Case Crime's newest offering is a 40 year old novel from master crime writer Lawrence Block.  Block delivers the goods with this tale about a drifter/grifter card cheat.  While the plot is thin in spots, the "noir" feel shines through with spare, tough, spot-on dialogue and characters that seem believable for the time and place. "Lucky at Cards" is a quick, satisfying dip into the "noir" crime fiction pool.
