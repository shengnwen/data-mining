The book is sort of slow to start with, but it picks up in time.  A lot of it is predictable, but by the end of the book I liked the story enought to buy "At First Sight", the follow-up.  If you're looking for a good airplane book or something to read on the beach, look no farther.  If you want a truely compelling story, why are you considering Nicholas Sparks anyway?
