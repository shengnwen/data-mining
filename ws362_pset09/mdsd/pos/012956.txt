This is a must read for graduate macro. class and economic growth. The ordinary differential equations discussion at the appendix is concise and intuitive.  Derivation of equations is very clearly presented in this book. But you must read the appendix before you read the first chapter. Like how to derive the growth convergence rate in ch.2 and the numerical procedures in the book. This book exhibits a perfect blend of theory, econometric work and even numerical method. Of course, for log linearization, you definitely want to look for elsewhere. The last few chapters are good for choosing dissertation topics.
I tried to read Aghion and Howitt's 1992 seminal paper of endogenous growth, but found it inscrutible. After reading this book, I find it much easier. 
The only reason that it does not deserve 5 stars is huge number of typos, especially the numbering of equations. For example, pp.109, the description of fig 2.3 does not match the figure
