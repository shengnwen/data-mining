If his book "You Can Negotiate Anything", written in the 1980's was negotiating 101, then this is a step up and builds on, rather than repeats the lessons in his earlier book. 
About the same time his first book was published Herb Cohen was consulted regarding the seizure of the US Embassy hostages in Iran.  In this book he outlines his involvement in that incident, and uses it to illustrate some of the recommendations he makes this time around.
While this is not a "once over lightly" commentary on negotiating, it is immensely readable and if you end up buying it the book will serve you well on a number of levels - either as an entertaining read, a means of enhancing your own negotiating skills, or a how-to for budding negotiators at any level.
If you've never read his first book, never mind - this is even better. I highly recommend it.
