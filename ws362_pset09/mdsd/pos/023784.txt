I thought this book was pretty good.  I had the audio book and I did not really like the reader.  She was a little hard to understand.  I love murder mysteries.  I really like the part when the maid was killed for seeing something she was not suppost to.  The letter writer must have been pretty smart.  I felt bad for the writer because they must have been pretty lonely to start doing this to people.  Jerry is so into mysteries and even though he is suppost to be settling down he can't help but get involved.  I recomend this book to everyone with a sense of adventure, and loves mysteries.  I had a good time listening to this book, but i recomend reading it rather than listening to it
