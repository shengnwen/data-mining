If anyone is going into law, they need to read this book. If anyone cares about justice, they need to read this book. If good writing and profound insight means anything to you, read this book. It's impossible not to be  inspired by Gerry's honesty and courage and hope. Of all the books I have  read to date by Gerry (Making of a Country Lawyer, Give Me Liberty, How To  Argue and Win) - and they are all good - I still think Freedom To Slavery  is the best. Great to read. You'll want to change the world (again)
