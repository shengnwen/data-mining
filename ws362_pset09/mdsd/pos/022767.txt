The joy of Patrick O'Brian's books is the accuracy of his language among the characters as they speak (&quot;Give you joy!&quot;) and the accuracy of the depictions of naval events.  This includes accuracy of naval terminology.  I have listened to all of these books as Books-On-Tape and often find myself replaying sections to hear the language spoke again. This approach may assist persons like High Cotton &quot;could not get into these books&quot;. One of the greatest things about these books is their unparalleled historical accuracy.  When you hear a naval battle described, you can be assured it happened just as described.  How does the author place a fictional character and fictional ship into real events?  Cleverly!  Such as by having the hero captured by the enemy and observe the battle from the deck of the enemy's vessel. Or by having the hero's vessel arrive a few minutes behind the actual combatants and not actually taking a role in the action, but seeing and describing it.  In one of the books, Capt. Aubrey was called on the carpet at the Admiralty Offices in London for his provisioning of his ship.  Indignantly, he recites from memory what &quot;vittels&quot; and other supplies he provisioned his last voyage with.  In fact, the author, Patrick O'Brien, was given access to real Admiralty records.  What his character Aubrey was reciting was from an actual invoice of provisions for a naval warship during the Napoleanic War.  Very interesting stuff if you like history and if you like ships at sea.  Highly recommended, especially if you hear the novels read (spoken) rather than reading them.  Star Trek fans will love these books
