Bill is straightforward but not enough so! To his atute observations one humble reader might add:

1) 20% (probably 40-50)of American women surveyed admitted they would like to charge men for sex. A majority of the relationships between men and women in the USA (probably worse elsewhere in the world)are based on financial gain for the women in return for affection for the man.
2) More than 50% of women in America admitted cheating on a boyfriend or husband.. and NOT feeling guilty about it! Studies have shown that women are also much more adept at cheating than men are.
3)Companies have no loyalty to the very people who buy their products........ other Americans in the USA. Jobs are given to immigrants,saying Americans will not take them. Many Americans would take them if the pay was more in line with actual costs of basic living. 
4) The poverty level has never been revised since the 1950s perhaps because it might show how much poorer the USA is with respect to its PR image globally.
5) Justice in America IS a function of wealth, no matter what anyone says
