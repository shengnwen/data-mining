I read this book after I visited Gloucester last year and had a chance to read F/V Black Sheep before it was published, in it the author talks about drinking in a bar with Sully so it was interesting to be able to get this book and read about what happened to him. Gloucester fishermen sure lead tough lives. This is a very exciting book with lots of details and information about what their lives are like. I'll probably read it again.
