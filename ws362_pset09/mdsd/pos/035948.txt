The author deals in an original way with the difficult nexus between statistics and stories, between alpha- and betascience, without favouring one of them, and indeed arguing that both are complementary. This striking impartiality creates the space for original ideas about everyday-situations that every reader will certainly recognize. To be original about (seeming) banality, that is the work of a true great mind. The reason why I do not rate this book with the maximum score, is that it sometimes misses an overarching line of reasoning. The discursive path may strike some readers (like me) as too associative. Needless to say that such a style has its charms, but perhaps due to my Europe-continental education, I am a bit more at ease with a clear thesis and a transparant construction. Nevertheless: it is absolutely imperative to buy this book
