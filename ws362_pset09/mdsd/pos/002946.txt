Dr. Carnes book has been a revelation to many of my clients. They tend to recommend this book to others in their groups as a "great starter book for anyone hoping to understand their problems."  It certainly speaks honestly to the problems of sexual addiction and, as it applies to my interests, to the problems of sexual offending.  All of the men and women that I work with have been ajudicated for sexual offending and often struggle with the shame of their behaviors. This book helps them to realize that their struggles begin with recognizing the "stealth" processes which precede their actual offending.

Our groups are not about excusing behaviors but acknowledging and understanding them in order to avoid further offenses.  "No More Victims" is our mantra.
