This book is extremely helpful to those who are wishing to quit eating sugar. Almost immediately, the pages strengthen your resolve and heighten your motivation. That sugar is a factor in our general societal health decline, and that it adds to our collective physiological and psychological woes, is indisputable. Many of Duffy's aggregate claims are correct, but Sugar Blues is far more a polemic than that it is serious scholarship. Duffy writes to indict and persuade rather than to clarify "gray areas." That didn't bother me though as I was able to take it for what it was and appreciate it. For those looking for a more erudite discussion regarding the subject, they will have to look elsewhere.
