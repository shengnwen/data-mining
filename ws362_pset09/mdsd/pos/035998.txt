After reading A Dirty Job, I decided to begin at the beginning with Practical Demonkeeping. I am now addicted ... in love with the drug that is Christopher Moore. I began reading PD at the laudromat and was transfixed. I half wanted to stay there to finish the book (having great difficulty putting it away for the 10 minute drive home) ... but I decided my obsessive need of very clean linens was satisfied (if I had stayed longer I may have washed them again). Anyway, the drive home was tough ... without reading ... put it was fun to imagine Catch as the hood ornament on my Dae Woo with my clean linens in tow.

Christopher Moore is a treasure ... he is at once a "popular" author yet literary in his amazing writing talents. I am addicted, I am in love with these tales! The characters! The author! 

And as a sidenote ... the edition of PD I got from the Library has a great photo of Chris (I feel I actually call him Chris) with a Fabio-like mullet do that is at once adorable and bone chilling! READ THIS MAN ... NOW
