This book is as action-packed as any of Tamora Pierce's other stories. My only complaint was that it took a while for Beka to form meaningful relationships with other characters.  Alanna, Kel, Daine, and the children from the Circle of Magic series all form close bonds with allies and make enemies fairly early on.  Character develolpment is one of Pierce's strenghts.  

Once Beka began to admit others into her quest and see them as possible friends, the story picked up considerably - the second half of the book flew by. The small political intrigue and nonstop action is well done.  I look forward to the next book
