Four year old Amanda McCready disappeared from her bedroom one night while her mother was next door visiting a neighbor. At least that's what her distracted, chain-smoking mother, Helene, says. When Amanda's Aunt and Uncle want a little bit more attention paid to Amanda's disappearance than Helene does, detectives Gennaro and Kenzie agree to take the case. When they start digging around for clues, they find themselves surrounded by disreputable characters, drugs, money, filth and dead decaying bodies.

This book is not for the faint hearted.

I read Mystic River a few years ago (before they made the movie) and loved it. Lehane's writing style is uniquely suited to depict the gritty reality that made Mystic River memorable. I picked this one up in my local bookstore (it came highly recommended by the store's owner) and took it on vacation with me. I found that Lehane's style is evident in this book, too, but not quite as fully developed. Perhaps I've read a few too many books in this genre lately and need a change, but about three quarters of the way through, I just wanted it to be over. I peeked at the end of the book and was fully satisfied with the conclusion. That was good enough for me. I will watch for Lehane's novels in the future-when I'm once again ready for gritty, hard-edged, well-written stories
