Connelly gives a straightfoward mystery-detective read that provides a linear storyline of the detectives solving a 17-yr old murder mystery.  This novel comes without frills, tangents and extraordinary events.  The story is consistent in realism and in maintaining readers' interest.  Readers enjoy a fly-on-the-wall view of detectives struggling to break the case.  "Closers" is smartly written and is succinct and to the point. I enjoyed it and appreciate Connelly's skill in writing the seemingly precise amount of words for his purpose...he is not wordy and his story is not lacking
