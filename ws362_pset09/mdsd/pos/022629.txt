On top of the mutation, bug or dysfunctional cell that produces cancer, in ILLNESS AS METAPHOR, Sontag introduces the reader to an accompanied malady called metaphor.  A metaphor, of course, is nothing but a comparison, a verbal picture attempting to make the abstract more concrete.  But by depicting surprising similarities between two unlike things, by equating a disease like cancer or AIDS to a hopeless human condition, catching the metaphor may become as bad as the disease.  Metaphor may even prevent the patients from healing themselves.

Sontag discusses how diseases like AIDS, syphilis, TB, leprosy and cancer can be stretched out as metaphors.  The more mysterious the cause of the disease, the wider the application of that disease as metaphor.  The author shows the fallacy in extending military terminology, military metaphors, to the fields of medical treatment.  There are no magic bullets, bodies are not being invaded by alien cells and diseases need not become battles to the death.  In other words, metaphors will never cure any ailments, words will never become an antidote to any illness.  After one conquers the disease one must then eliminate the metaphor that surrounds that disease
