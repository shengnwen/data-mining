When I first read this book, upon finishing it I immediately proceeded to rip it's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces. That was how much the story affected me. It disgusted me, it disturbed me, it ... moved me. After brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head, and if that's not the mark of a great writer I don't know what is. I then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again.

Amid all the horror that Stephen King has unleashed from the darkness of his imagination, this has to be the most disturbing, disgusting and, at times, offensive work he has ever set to paper. Forget the movie... this is high octane writing which will leave you gasping for breath. With this book and "The Tommyknockers," Stephen King has proven that he is not just a great horror story writer, but a GREAT writer... period. Buy it, read it.
