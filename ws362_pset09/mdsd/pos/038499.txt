This book is incredibly funny a real down to earth example of the teenage drama and romance we sometimes suffer through.  The book is about a stoned-out chick named Collen that stumbles upon geeky-little Ben, after their encounter Ben seems to suddenly fall for this girl and tries to get her attention, he wants only to be with her but it doesnt seem to want to turn out that way for Ben.  With an overly protective grandmother that tries to ignore Bens CP or at least tries to act as if everything is normal (like nothing wrong with Ben even though there is), it seems like Ben wont have his way with the careless young youth Colleen.  In my opinion this is a kick ass book, I totally fell for it the plot and the comedy, oh the comedy
