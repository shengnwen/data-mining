I'm an M.A. student in philosophy who has found this collection very useful and representative of the current state of the issue in American ethics.  It contains landmark essays by landmark people and could be of  much use both to the lay reader and in ethics classes.  One must conclude  that the gentleman who found the volume 'appualing' [sic] would be best  served by english instruction and higher education before stumbling into  untranslated Anglo-American philosophy
