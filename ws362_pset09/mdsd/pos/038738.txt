Many years ago, there was a book (and an audio presentation) called Real Men Don't Eat Quiche. It was a man's guide to being a man. It was also written in the early 1990's. 

Jim Belushi, the star of ABC's According to Jim, has taken it upon himself to do the update with his book , Real Men Don't Apologize (one MP3, Four hours, abridged, Brilliance audio). The advice Belushi gives in sound MACHO advice for today's males over the age of 35. It makes sense for Today's  man

The humor in this production is so true to life and the advice makes sense.  His reading of his book  is good, better than most celebrity narrators...which is above the rest. Belushi uses his TV JIM persona to help characterwise to  move this abridgement along, It works for him. 

 Also included in this audio presentation is Belushi  singing with his band the Sacred Hearts. The musical selections seem like the Blues Brothers which is brother John was involved in. 

This audio is a good piece of humor for the modern man...and the modern woman listening next to him.
