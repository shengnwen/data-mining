I really liked this book for the information that it presented that I have never seen in any other sources.  The stories are real and interesting accounts of what Indian life was like and what Indians were like.  It gives the Indian back his identity as each one being an individual person making their own decisions not bound to their instinctual behavior.  These authentic account allow someone to be immersed into a very different culture in a very different time
