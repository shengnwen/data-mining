This is attractive book featuring traditional as well as innovative recipes. Lora Brody's expertise in the science and art of cooking with chocolate is clear. The book holds forth on technical aspects as well as ideas and recipes. Its a good gift idea because it will work as a cookbook as well as coffee-table eye candy. 

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it lacks nutritional information. Also (IMHO) its about time cookbooks started to offer online resources where users can rate recipes/ include possible modifications and meal ideas.
