Ruminating on how bad it could be is a time-honored strategy for coping with unpleasant situations.  Frankly, I think that anyone who says they love their job either (1) doesn't really need to work anyway, or (2) has managed to work their way up to a level where the poop flows downhill.

Nobody could reasonably remain depressed about their job (assuming they are not already on the list) after reading about the "walking menu" (#22) or "rat catcher" (#12).  Who doesn't feel like a Sherpa (#1) at times?  But unlike the Sherpa, you don't have a one-in-twenty risk of dying on any given workday.

Manages a nice balance between the factual, "NYPD Harbor Unit: Body Recovery Detail" (#40), and satirical, "It's a Small World ride operator" (#3).  

A great gift for anyone who gripes about their job
