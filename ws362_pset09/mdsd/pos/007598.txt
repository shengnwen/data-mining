The textbook delivers great diagrams, good for virtual learners. Fancy words are rarely used. It also corresponds well with the IB Chemistry syllabus. If you are thinking about ordering Chemistry textbook, and if you are an international student who are not so strong at English, this textbook is good to go.

There's one thing IB students should consider is that IB Higher level contains further stuff that is not included in the textbook, as well as the fact that the order of the chapters may be a little bit confusing. IB students may have to go back and forth while studying about topics like Thermal Chemistry
