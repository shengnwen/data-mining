I doubt that some of the examples were true to life.  Some dogs were at first presented as knowing as much as a 3 year old human child.  These dogs were presented as responding to long sentences and did things that dogs just cannot do.  Then the book analysed these impossible canine responses.  And I do not accept the book's analysis.  These fantastic canine responses could not have happened as the book asserts.

However, the material presented seems sound enough in principal.  I guess the author was taking artistic license to amplify the points of his thesis.  Whatever, it doesn't matter.  

This book does support many of my own observations and has given me insight into dog behavior that I was not yet aware.  

I am 67, a lifetime dog owner who spent a year working full time for a Veterinarian when I was 17, and presently have a 5 year German Shepherd.  If you are a typical dog owner you will gain much from this book
