I picked up this book based solely on the title, because I am a cheesemaker, and I thought it was hilarious that there was a book whose main characters are cheesemakers. I absolutely loved the characters. Corrie and Fee are so wonderful, if they really existed, I'd hop on a plane to Ireland to meet them.

I also want to comment on the use of the word "romance" used by other reviewers in reference to this book. They obviously have never read a book in the romance genre in their lives. This book is NOT a romance, although there are love interests. The main focus of this book is not a romance. This is a book about two cheesemakers who need to find someone to take over their business before they die ... and you see, not just anyone can be a cheesemaker in their eyes.

While I would have said that cheesemaking is a blend of art and science, Corrie and Fee would also add a bit of magic to the mix, and that creates a delightful story
