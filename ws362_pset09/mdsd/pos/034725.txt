The Organized Executive covers four topics dedicated to managing paperwork, tasks, time and staff.  It specifically gives guidelines on planning one's day and setting priorities.  It gives scheduling advice and a perspective on how to avoid time wasters.  Staff problems from delegation to staff, expectations of staff, and management of staff is covered.  The section on managing paperwork is covered first and provides a system for managing paperwork.    
"The key to paper management is processing: that is, channeling each piece from your in-box to its appropriate destination."  Learning a system that handles paperwork efficiently will result in greater accomplishments, more enjoyment from work, and result in spending fewer hours with paperwork.

TOSS: "Man's best friend, aside from a dog, is the wastebasket," says Business Week. Ask yourself, "What is the worst thing that can happen if I toss this out?

REFER: Delegate paperwork to a staffer or others that are more qualified or trained to deal with the paperwork. Follow-up on paperwork that you delegate.

ACT: Use an action folder to ensure that items that need attention are together in one location.  Later, this folder can be prioritized.

FILE: For items that can not be delegated or require action, but can not be discarded immediately, should be filed.  Mark this filed paperwork with a discard date to know when the paperwork can be successfully tossed.
