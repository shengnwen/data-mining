This book is interesting in that it speaks of a topic most would prefer to be swept under the carpet somewhere, ie conduct and etiquette when dealing with sex workers of any kind. It's a subject most would rather avoid discussing, but as long as it indeed exists and will never go away, there might as well be a book about this topic. And what struck me about the approximately 30 essays in the book from professional dominants, prostitutes, strippers and escorts was a common theme. The "theme" being that anyone visiting any type of sex worker should treat them like any other worker, by being polite and well-groomed (ie making sure to bathe before visiting one!). While I'm not in the habit of using any sex worker-related services (although one never knows), it floors me to think people just assume because a sex worker is in an "illegal" trade that it gives them the right to be rude or unkempt. It somehow seems common sense to me the nicer you treat someone, the nicer generally they'll treat you. While there are numerous other "rules of etiquette" these sex workers discuss, it seems you'll have a better time by being well-mannered. 

This truly is a book that deserves to be available, even if the topic is one that makes some uncomfortable
