I heard a fascinating interview with the author on NPR and immediately went online to buy this novel.  What a wonderful read!  This is a  passionate tale about love and duty, honor and sex, fidelity and family.   Every single character (&amp; there are dozens) is drawn fully and deeply,  even those characters who appear only for a few pages.  The story is a  simple one with its routes in &quot;Romeo and Juliet:&quot;  two families  forever at war even after they've forgotten why they are feuding.  It is  also a story of a small town in Ireland and every single one of its  inhabitants and how they effect the three principal characters:  Joseph, a  farmer, and his sister Breege who falls in love with Mick Bugler, a  stranger from Australia, and how their love for one another changes  everyone's life.  You cannot help but know that the story will end  tragically, but because you care for each of the principal chararacters so  much and because Edna O'Brien refuses to label some good and others bad,  you keep hoping for the inevitable to be put off.  O'Brien is obviously  influenced by James Joyce:  her language is at all times ripe and  imaginative and wonderfully descriptive.  Her prose also reminds me of  William Faulkner and the way he had of burrowing deep into the minds and  souls of his complex people.  This is certainly one of the finest  contemporary novels I have read in many years
