This book was the most useful book I purchased  to plan our trip to San Francisco. I can't say enough good things about it. It divides the city into neighborhoods then goes through each one not only listing the good  points and points of interest, but also listing the bad.  The information  is practical and easy to find and understand.  His carefully researched  data helps one understand the city and the culture that make it so unique.   From parking garages to street vendors this is the book to have on San  Francisco
