What Sen. Byrd did or did not do 30 years ago is not relevant to what is written in this book. Those that label this work as "Bush Bashing" probably did not even read it. What the Sen. points out, as compiled in his 50+ years in Congress, is outlined in 4 salient points:
1) Bush misled America into an unprepared and irresponsible war in Iraq based on unfounded and unproven assertions that Hussien posessed WMD.
2)Bush took advantage of 9/11 and bullied his way, usurping the Constitution and bypassing Congress, to declare war against Iraq.
3) Bush has turned, for the fiscal years 2001-2010, a ten-year $5.6 trillion surplus budget into a 4+ trillion dollar deficit through tax-cuts for the richest of Americans and outrageous expenditures for the war on terrorism (Iraq.) This will be the largest budget deficit in American history.
4) By spending this country into oblivion, Bush has taken much needed funds away from public social services (Social Security and Medicare to name a few) and also funds from Homeland Security, to squander it in another country's (Iraq) money pit; which, by the way, was neither a threat to this country nor a safe haven for terrorists.
As the senior member of the Senate Appropriations Commitee, Sen. Byrd has facts and figures to substantiate all of his assertions dealing with Bush's irrresposible waste of taxpayer dollars. Nothing in this book, as far as I could fathom, was made up, exaggerated or not backed up by cold hard facts. Further, Sen. Byrd was one of only a handful of Congress members to oppose this insane war from the beginning. If you are a true-blue Republican, then this book will be painful to read, but if you are open-minded and want to find out why we are in this bottomless abyss dealing with the middle east, then I would recommend at least browsing this book
