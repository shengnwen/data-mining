Blue Blood is an very interesting, yet lengthy book from a cop who writes beautifully. I actually read the book twice - the first time right after I was attacked and thrown into the world of police investigation. At this point the book wasn't right for me, too long, too detail oriented and not enough cop stories a la the TV show cops. Then, after having lived in a high impact zone in NYC for a while now and having seen cops and perps in action a lot more than once, I picked up the book again. I took the time an enjoyed the details and the knitty-gritty, and, in contrast to other reviewers, I absolutely enjoyed the stories about Conlon's family history as well as the history of the NYPD. This book is more like written down thoughts by an intelligent and nice guy with a good sense of humor and the talent to observe the details and tell them to us. The fact that this book is written by an officer who is still on the force in NYC gives you the illusion that you can somehow run into him and have a cup of coffee, which is awesome. As many have pointed out, the bar was set too high with a 1$$$ book deal for a first time author, the book should have been edited better and the marketing should have made clear what the book was really about. Also, why the picture on the back with the chest hair sticking out? This guy had no flirt let alone Sex AT ALL during the entire book - so why not use just a regular headshot? Leads me to believe Conlon should continue writing - he is an amazing talent - but the marketing and editing work need to improve and sell Conlon for what he really is: unconventional guy, very good writer, blue collar guy with ivy league education. Hope to hear more from him. Conlon, if you're reading your own reviews (and I think you do) let me know when your next book comes out and if you ever have an open reading
