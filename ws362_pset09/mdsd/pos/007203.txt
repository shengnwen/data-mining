I've been adventuring off reading new writers that i've been hearing about. Well Sparks was one of them and after reading this I wonder why did it take me so long to read his books. This book was really heart touching. The mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his. The love story was also great because that is somewhat reality. When you loose someone or go threw hard times; Its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own . I can't wait to read more of Sparks books because I've already heard so many great things about them
