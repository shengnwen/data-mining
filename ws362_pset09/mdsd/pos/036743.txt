As a professor management who is interested in corporations acting more responsibly, I have just begun to use this book in my senior strategic management course. Hollender is a thoughtful and insightful proponent of socially responsible business.  Each chapter covers a specific characteristics of SRB (accountability, transparency, sustainability, etc.).

He recognizes that running a company using these principles is not easy but definitely worth it.

He covers most of the pioneers in the field (Roddick, Cohen, Anderson, Chouinard) and their struggles to live their corporate lives in a responsbile way.

I highly recommend it.
