After reading this book, I was absolutely thrilled. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela is this remarkable person that you kind of feel a personal relationship to as you go through this great piece of work. Mandela represents the struggle of the oppressed South Africans to regain their pride and freedom and it is fantastic that Mandela has lived his ideals, a unique achievement by a mere mortal.

Going through the book reveals that you are reading about someone who is not trying to exalt himself but someone who is really human and makes mistakes, is man enough to admit to them and goes to show that even after spending a generation in prison, he neither lost his humanity nor was brutalised by the nasty experience.

Mandela was the first president of a truly democratic South Africa but as soon as he was President, be broke with traditional African leaders practice and started grooming a successor. After only one term in office, he voluntarily gave up power, a rarity on the continent.

Mandela is a man of disarming simplicity, very honest and has done Africa proud. I sometimes day dream of what the African continent would be like if most countries were blessed with half a Mandela leader each (it would be asking too much to ask for a full Mandela.

This is an inspirational book to the whole of humanity that is well written that I strongly recommend to everyone.
