This book is great.  It has all you need to complete a research paper at any level.  I used it for my bachelor's project which, according to my advisor, is equivalent to a Master's thesis in content requirement.  My advisor has asked me to lend him the book so he can use it to revise the current research manual supplied by the college.  This book is easy to read and has a lot of useful tables and charts.
