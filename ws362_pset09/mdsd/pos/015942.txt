I am reading all of Cassandra King's books backwards, so going from her latest, fabulous novel to this one, her first, is truly an education.

Like all her books, The Sunday Wive is mesmerizing. It completely held my interest from start to finish. I know some people objected to the subject matter: the story of a disaffected, mistreated wife of a Methodist minister in the deep South. But really, the main character, Willodean (Dean), speaks for all bullied people everywhere, child or adult.

Profoundly greatful to her husband, much-older Ben, for rescuing her from a life of poverty and mistreatment at the hands of alcoholic parents, self-proclaimed "white trash" Dean suffers many more years at the hands of her pompous, self-righteous, supercilious, amibitious husband, Ben. AND she suffers at the hands of the "church ladies," judgmental, equally self-righteous women who find Dean lacking in whatever church her husband is placed.

Then Dean meets fabulous, irrepressible Augusta, unapproachable because she has married into a wealthy family, and the two form a madcap, wonderful friendship. Until tragedy strikes.

All of this had me glued to the pages, loving every minute. But the book could have been shorter, as it had several false endings, any of which would have been perfect, in the last 100 pages. Also, the characters are largely one-dimensional. Augusta is Auntie Mame and Anne Rivers Siddons' Nora, all wrapped up into one big overwhelming package. Ben is all bad, hateful, a parody. Dean is long suffering, can't see the nose on her face, just suffers. And so forth.

But as a first novel? Brava, Cassandra! She was, and is, a fine writer.
