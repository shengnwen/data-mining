I am an MBA student at USC looking to get into the I Banking field and this book has really been helpful.  It has been consistent with the terms and concepts I've learned in school and through networking with people.

Once I start interviewing, I feel confident that I will have a good inside perspective of the profession as a result of this book.  Understandably, it leans toward the bulge bracket firms, but doesn't ignore the niche players.

Definitely a good read for anyone looking to learn more about Investment Banking
