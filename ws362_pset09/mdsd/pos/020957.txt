I'm only a senior, starting grad school in the fall. Clearly written and well organised, and the advice in this book certainly seems sound - grad students and profs have told me much the same things. However, although it claims to be for the sciences, what they really mean is biological sciences. It was a bit difficult, starting to read this book thinking it's for everyone and then realising that it has an enormous bio slant and that you have to weed out 'irrelevant for physicists' bits all the time. There's a few token physicist quotations, but so what? That's why it's getting 4 starts. Otherwise, quite good...
