As a business lawyer, I regularly review asset protection resources so I can better represent my clients - many of whom develop high net-worths through high risk activities (e.g., physicians, "aggressive" entrepreneurs).  Until reading this particular book, all of the resources have typically fallen into one of two categories: (1) materials proposing techniques that sound too good to be true and, based on recent legal decisions, have been proven to be too good to be true, and (2) materials that simply discuss the absolute basics of asset protection planning.

This book is different and, given the excellent national reputation the two authors enjoy in the asset protection community, I expected it to be different.  It provides you with numerous LEGITIMATE asset protection techniques that have been proven to work - or at least give you a real shot of having them work without the risk of putting you in jail if they don't.  Many of these techniques are quite sophisticated and you will not learn about them in most other resources.  The book also helps explain what you should and should NOT expect to achieve with asset protection planning, by, in part, discrediting the techniques being promoted by those less educated and/or less reputable than the authors.

This book is not a How-To book that will provide a step-by-step, do-it-yourself plan on establishing an asset protection plan.  However, this area of the law is particularly difficult and fraught with serious traps for the unwary, so it is not appropriate for a non-lawyer or lawyer inexperienced in this area to do on their own anyway.  It is, however, valuable in letting you know what numerous legitimate techniques are available (and what techniques are NOT legitimate), so you can successfully pursue their implementation with your experienced lawyer.  I, for one, have learned a great deal from this book that will benefit my clients, and sincerely trust the legitimacy of the information I gained
