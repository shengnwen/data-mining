This is a very good book. The area of the mental side of singing and performing is really paid too little attention to. There are so many books about singing technique etc. At last a good book on this subject! After having read only a few pages, it helped me already. The book is giving me very helpfull practical tips about selfconfidence on stage etc. The only thing is, that the English which is being used, is not so easy to read as in most American literature (I'm from Holland). But the positive thing about that is that I am increasing my English vocabulary..
