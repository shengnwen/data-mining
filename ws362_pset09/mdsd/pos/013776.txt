The book was very inspirational and gave a lot of useful information on how to go about starting up a business, expectations, and how to plan and prepare.  I liked the entrepreneurial stories woven throughout the book. However, I was expecting to read more about forming a business plan. I know there is not a one size fits all, but I was looking for some actual examples.
