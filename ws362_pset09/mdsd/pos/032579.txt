I count this as one of the most useful books on photography one can own. Its strength is in its explanation of the Zone System and how a photographer at any level can put it to use. Though the information is  quite accessible there are a number of calibration tests which can seem a  bit tedious. But if one follows through it will pay off in allowing the  photographer to put to film and paper what one visualizes in one's mind
