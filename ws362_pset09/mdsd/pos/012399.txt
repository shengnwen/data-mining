I read the book "Speak" by Laurie Halse Anderson. Basicly the book is about a girl who is completly ignored in school because she called the cops during a end of the summer bash all the seniors were having. They all think she did this because she was scared but it was actually a bigger reason. Also in the mean time Melinda is also struggling to make friends.
      My favorite part of the book is when Melinda and "it" are in the janitors closet and Melinda fights him off. I like this part because Melinda has to figure out a sneaky way to get him off. Also because the door is locked it makes it much harder. 
      I recommend this book. I recommend it because it's a very good book and it keeps you wondering why she called the police. It never gives you a straight answer until the end and as she makes more friends you wonder why they ever left.
