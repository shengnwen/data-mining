As a recovering addict (3 years clean) I fell in love with this book. The way he describes his struggle to overcome the addictions, to get past his childhood trauma, and to just be a grown up was charming. I especially related to him describing how he could keep the electricity and phones turned on cause he couldn't pay the bills, not because he didn't have the money, but because he became overwhelmed at the thought of responsibility. Also the way he described his mother's suffocating needs, saying that even the smallest task ("changing a lightbulb) seemed so daunting and huge. 
I wasn't sure how much material would be left after Running with Scissors, but there was plenty of substance to keep Dry together. I found this book a lot more enjoyable because it wasn't as illicit as the previous, but still packed with conflict. 
That being said, I'm wondering when the public will get tired of one man constantly writing about himself. I for one am looking foward to reading the rest of his books. The one thing I love about his books, aside from content, is the way it feels like you're having a conversation with him. The writing is so casual and not full of fluffy metaphores, analogies and ridiculous details
