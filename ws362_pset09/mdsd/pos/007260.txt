Strawberry Girl is a good book. I enjoyed it because of all the characters and excitment. The characters gave me a good idea of life a long time ago. I don't think I would have liked to lived in those times. Birdie Boyer worked very hard trying to be a strawberry girl. She had lots of chores to do each day plus go to school. The family worked hard too, things changed for the family when the Slaters came to visit. Birdie knew the Slaters would cause trouble for her family. The family pulled together and things turned out fine
