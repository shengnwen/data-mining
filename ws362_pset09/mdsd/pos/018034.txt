****
This is the story of a woman's recovery from the death of her husband, her soulmate, with whom she had a wonderful marriage. It is honest, compelling, and even though it deals with a serious subject, entertaining. Elizabeth Berg's writing style is lyrical and beautiful.

The main character, Betta, who is only around 50 years old, learns to build a new life for herself in unexpected ways. Even if you are not dealing with grief, or if the subject scares you off, this book is worth the read, because Betta's grief is presented in a human way that everyone can relate to. The simple things, ordinary people, and everyday life activities she takes comfort in are common to all of our lives.

It is a fairly short book (just over 200 pages), easily read in an evening.
