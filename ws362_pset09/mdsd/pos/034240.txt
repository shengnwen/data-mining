"MARS AND VENUS ON A DATE" is a great book.  It is very educational for anyone that is single and just can't seem to find their sole mate or they discard their sole mate for lack of understanding them. 
I do think that everyone should read "MEN ARE FROM MARS AND WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS" first, so that this book makes complete  sense.  These are two great books and everyone should read them.  These books really help to improve your communication skills with the opposite sex~
