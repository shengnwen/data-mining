I received the 6-volume spanish version of this work from the Venezuelan Ministry of Education in 1982 as one of the prizes of the national math olympics. For anyone who has an interest in this subject and would like to get a taste of the breadth and variety of all the faces of this discipline, without getting too much into the details, this is an excellent work. I've looked for an English print, without success (although I've seen some volumes being sold second hand)
