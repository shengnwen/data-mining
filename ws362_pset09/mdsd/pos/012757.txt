This is a decent book (I have enjoyed O'Neil's other books so much I can't bear to give any of his books less than 5 stars!)  This book is very little writing and mostly charts of stocks right before they went into the toilet (e.g. Enron).  O'Neil's CANSLIM model is useful for picking stocks about to go up; he has not done any corresponding rigorous research (to my knowledge) to find out which stocks go down.  If you're not an O'Neil groupie, you can afford to skip this one
