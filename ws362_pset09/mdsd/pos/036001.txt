I thought the book was a great read, the signs are pretty true to people.  I like the different categories such as the compatabilty area, and the gift ideas.  I let all my friends read the book.  It is a good read!  I would buy it all over again, I would however would have liked the book more, if they had a friendship section, because I would like to see If I'm compatible with my friends
