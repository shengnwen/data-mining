I have to say that this is my favorite of the Chronicles. It has great  characters, a riveting storyline, and the most beautiful picture of true,  sacrificial love I have ever read. To say anymore would give away the  ending. DO NOT skip ahead in this one or you will not get the full impact  of the story. It is better to keep guessing. But read it a second time to  get the details that you missed from not knowing the secret
