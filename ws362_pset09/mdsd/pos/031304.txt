I was introduced to Salmela's work through some friends living in Minnesota.  One wintry weekend we toured his Jackson Meadow subdivision, taking our time to examine nearly every property: the specific architecture of each structure, the landscaping, and the feel of the development as a whole.  Our feelings were substantially complex, ranging from awe and intrigue to doubt and disturbance.  But Salmela's signature on the land was definitely singular, and we all agreed that in some way, his work had blended with the natural world.

This book is a great primer for entering Salmela's world.  The photography is clean and expansive and the chosen sites are almost all spectacular.  In particular, the coverage of Jim Brandenburg's home is noteworthy.  Salmela's work on Brandenburg's property is spectacular and resonant with Falling Waters in my humble opinion.

If you are a Midwesterner interested in architecture, buy this book and enjoy
