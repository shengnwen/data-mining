This book simply showed that success is not just dependent on cognitive abilitites but more importantly on emotional competence.

In summary, emotional competence consists of personal competence which is the ability to recognize one's emotion and to successfully manage it and social competence which refers to the capacity to be more socially sensitive and to relate well with others.


The concept has been well-explained. Sprinkled with real-life examples, the book has effectively dramatized the importance of emotional intelligence in the corporate milieu. Without it, business suffers. With it, business prospers.

The description for each competence was clear and detailed. However, the book doesn't provide practical strategies on how to develop the various emotional skills. For instance, there's no detailed discussion on how to listen more effectively, show empathy, be more aware of one' s emotions, to name just a few.

In general, the books has achieved its purpose. This is an excellent treatise that I highly recommend to everyone.
