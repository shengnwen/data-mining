This book overshadows almost everything ever written about Peter the Great  and his era. It is deeply researched, incisively argued, stylishly  presented, and a marvelous read.  Hughes organizes a huge amount of  material logically and clearly; her prose exudes spirit and style.  She  revises much received wisdom.  She treats many neglected topics with great  insight and good sense.  She makes many fascinating comparisons and  constantly keeps in mind the contemporary context that Peter lived in.  She  has a wonderful eye for memorable quotations and shows great wit in her  wide-ranging presentation. Her book makes many others look silly and  shallow and stodgy. Her book achieves a wonderful balance between scholarly  discoveries and revisions and popular topics with wide appeal to any  literate person. A sterling achievement in all respects
