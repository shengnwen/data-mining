The book starts out slow and dry--first 3 chapters or so--but if you stick with it you will be rewarded with an amazing story! 
Read all 3 books--the second is quick paced and ending of the 3rd is so moving!!! The characters evolving is fun to read within the storyline. 
I am 37, have two children 11&13 we all enjoyed reading them.
