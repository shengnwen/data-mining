I mean the other reviews. Wo wo wo wo---this isn't a novel with a "dark" plot or characters that are supposed to be realistic individuals. I admit this is the first book I've read by the author, but what this is is satire, these people are supposed to be caricatures. Even the title tells you that. Rich American WASPs are seen through the eyes of a newly arrived illegal immigrant from Haiti. It's the Americans (in Westchester County, I'm assuming) who are the "primitive" people, and not in the literal sense. It's good satire because the author's point is very true, and she has you laughing while shaking your head at the same time. Here is a divorced father who buys his kids their own life-size jukebox, and explains to the Haitian nanny he has a terrible dilemma, because he never knows what to get the kids for Christmas. The Haitian woman meanwhile thinks that kids from her country would prefer too many choices to no food at all. She's having a lot of trouble understanding the world she's been dropped into, and it is pretty crazy. You'll enjoy this book a lot if you see it for what it really is. In some ways it reminds me of Don DeLillo's White Noise, or William Boyd's books. Another story along these lines is that old movie, The Gods Must Be Crazy. We do live in a crazy environment, and sometimes all you can do is laugh
