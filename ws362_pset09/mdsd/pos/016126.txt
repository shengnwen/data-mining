I wish I had read this novel before reading Pamuk's "Snow" because I feel as if they share so much in common. Both novels deal with a writer figure who is thrown into a political mess and tries his best to navigate the mess with the limited (or unlimited) skills of an author/writer. The fact that Roth was passed over for the Nobel Prize for Pamuk in a ywear that most thought he would win only makes any further comparisons all the more interesting (but ultimately superficial and really only done for the fun of it).

In this novel, Roth tries to bend reality by writing as himself in what is presumably a fictional situation. The memoir-like prose and the heavy borrowing from the "real world" makes it difficult to decide whether or not any of this ever happened. It reminds me of a grand experiment, much like what Henry James used to do in his own fiction, but revamped for our modern tastes. The Philip Roth of the novel flies to Jerusalem and encounters someone who looks remarkably like him and who has been impersonating him all over Europe, touting a Diasporic model for the resettlement of the Jewish people back to their homelands. Not much action takes place, but Roth is able to spin layers of paranoia, so much so that you often do think you're reading non-fiction. Only a master storyteller could produce something like this. Fans of Auster would love what Roth has done with text. 

"Operation Shylock" stands as an important text, especially considering the fact that Roth is one of the best living writers today. I look forawrd to his Nobel Acceptance Speech
