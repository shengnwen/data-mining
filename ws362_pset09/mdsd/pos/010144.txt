This book is a very good example of how a good writer can make a story really shine. The Bridges of Madison County is about an Iowa farmer's wife (Francesca) falls in love with a traveler while her husband is away for the week. The couple has a fling for a week then they end it without every contacting each other ever again. Robert Waller uses great description and vibrant details to make this story come alive. The story has passion, mystery and illusion. You will love this book if you're the kind of person that enjoys reading books for hours and not being able to put it down. This book is a short read, taking just over two hours to read. This book is told through two points of view, Francesca and the traveler, in a diary type of format. Even though this book might be hard to fallow in the beginning as soon as you figure it out you it is worth it. This book ends very abruptly and the ending is a cliff hanger. I recommend this book for reading because of the story line and the writer is very interesting in the way he describes the situation. Hattie O. 4th perio
