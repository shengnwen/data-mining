Only one thing puzzles me about James Fallows: why is he not considered among our most important American journalists? 

The respected Bob Woodward rightly caused a national sensation with the publication of "State of Denial." Yet, those of us who have been faithfully reading Fallows' reporting in The Atlantic Monthly were made aware of this Administration's predispositions since late 2003 - the year of the Iraqi invasion. It is not news to Fallows' readers that George W. Bush's inner circle chose to overlook facts and cautious warnings from the Government's top professionals - Pentagon war planners and State Department veterans whose responsibility was to provide our elected leaders with the best information possible.

In the January/February 2004 issue of The Atlantic, Fallows wrote: "All the government working groups concluded that occupying Iraq would be far more difficult that defeating it. [Paul] Wolfowitz either didn't notice this evidence or chose to disbelieve it." These statements are among the many damning - but now widely known and accepted - facts that Fallows brought to light in the early going.

Keep your eye on the work of James Fallows. He asks the right questions of the right people long before it becomes the popular thing to do.
