Lectures on Revival attempts to define revival and its cause.  It could be called a "how to" book on revival.  Among numerous issues concerning revival, the book looks at the invaluable necessity of prayer for revival,  how to pray for revival, how to promote revival, how to preach for a  revival and the hindrances to revival. The strength of the book is the  authority of the author.  It is one thing for theological academia to muse  about the nature of revival, it is quite another when the leader of  national revival shares from genuine experience.  The book contains much  concerning the practical aspects of revival. Personally, I found his  teaching on prayer for revival to be the most helpful.  It included  powerful personal testimonies and real life examples. The book comes from a  strong Armenian viewpoint.  I thought many of Finney's insights did not  align with Biblical truth.  Some of his applications, like the problem of  barking dogs and chewing tobacco in church are no longer relevant for most  American churches. Despite that, this book is mandatory reading for any  serious student of revival and valuable reading for anyone desiring to  experience it
