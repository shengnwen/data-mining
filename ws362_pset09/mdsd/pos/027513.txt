This first book of Jane Austen's doesn't have the same subtlety as her later works, but it is light-hearted and good writing.  It's amazing how skillful she was at writing dialogue, even at a younger age.  I mention her youth because it pervades Northanger Abbey; the character are youthful in spirit, and I think that of all her novels, this one might be the most accessible to the modern day younger reader.
