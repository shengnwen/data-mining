I have been using this training method using free weights, machines and even a BowFlex ever since the first edition came out. IT WORKS!!!!!!! I like the vast use of references because I have a biological sciences background and one MUST back up what one claims with data and/or references.

I played contact sports (football, hockey and lacrosse) and basketball from elementary school, through high school and college and after college. I'm 44 years old and still play competitive basketball in a local men's league with teenagers and twenty-somethings.  I am also an assistant football coach (offense/defensive lineman) at the local middle school. I promote this method of weight training, even to the high school coaches. My oldest son has been playing at the middle school level the last two years and will be playing JV football next year.  He will begin strength traing after this season and this method WILL be the method for weight training he uses.

Much of the information I received about weight training was gym rat "opinion" or from pansy-assed body-building magazines.  This approach gets you in and out of the gym quickly and works  QUICKLY and EFFECIENTLY at building strength!!  This is very important for student athletes who need to get in and out of the gym and for coaches that need to minimize wasted time in the gym.

This is the ONLY method of weight trainin g I use.  I have been using it for years
