Horacio Quiroga wrote like no other.  His use of words is phenomenal, and the way he describes the things and people and places in his stories is almost like being there.  You can actually SEE the action develop and  unfold before your eyes.  He has the ability to literally write the reader  into his stories.  It gives me the impression of being one of the  characters the action happens to during the story.  After reading these,  the stories are not easily forgotten.  A classic for all time
