It's hard to like tofu, though it's a bargain protein food.  This little cookbook has many truly quick and easy recipes to liven up the stuff and make it interesting and tasty. (I think delicious is too much to hope for  under any circumstances.) Directions are easy and straightforward, good for  someone who doesn't want to spend her life in the kitchen. Ingredients used  in recipes are easy to find on supermarket shelves.  Tofu-Raspberry pudding  is going to become my favorite low-fat, low-carb dessert
