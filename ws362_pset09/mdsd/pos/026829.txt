What a phenomenal book.  Essentially this is a collection of adventure packed true river stories.  Some of the stories inspired me to pack my gear and leave for the river that day, while others put  life, death, adventure, and risk in new perspective.  If you love to paddle, dream about paddling,  or just enjoy adventure, then buy this book.  Some of the stories can be a  bit overrun with technical river lingo, but even the novice (me) can get  through it easily.  I honestly had to start rationing out  or limiting the  number of pages I would read a night.  It is a book I did not want to end
