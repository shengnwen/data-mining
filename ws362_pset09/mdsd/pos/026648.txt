I found this book to be very readable.  I disagree with the reviewers who found it to be a "McBook."  It is true that, like most authors, Grisham doesn't always deliver -- but he certainly does in this one!  I couldn't put this book down once I had started.  It is the story of two boys, who see something terrible -- a suicide.  But before that, one of the boys is told something dreadful by the man -- a secret that the mob wants, the police want, the FBI wants.  How the eleven-year old boy deals with that, and the folks who help him, is what this book is about.  It would make a great movie (if iut hasn't already been made into one!).  I enjoyed every word of it
