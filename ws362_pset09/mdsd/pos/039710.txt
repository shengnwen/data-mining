Although he maintains a much lower profile than Rupert Murdoch or Barry Diller, Sumner Redstone is just as powerful and interesting as his better-known peers.  Sure, he's boldly promotional about his achievements and about those of his company, Viacom - but as someone who came from humble beginnings to create a tremendous empire through intelligence and hard work, he can afford to indulge a bit.  He gives credit when credit is due and pulls few punches when it is not.  What is perhaps most remarkable about his story is that the most exciting part did not begin until he was into his 60's.  It is a good read, offering insights into corporate politics, negotiation, and the recent history of the entertainment business.  Recommended
