I have read all of Dave Peltzer books, it was wonderful to read his brother Richards account of the abuse Dave suffered and how he came to replace Dave in his mother's Eyes. I do wish he would have not left us hanging at the end of the novel though, I was left with more questions about his life once they moved then I might have been if he would have covered things up to the point of his marriage. I hope that he will write another book enlightening us on life once they moved to Utah. I highly recommend this book to everyone who has read Dave Peltzers books, if you haven't read them first so you understand this book to the fullest that the author wants you to.
