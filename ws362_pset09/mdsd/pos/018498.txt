There are some truly excellent ideas in this book...in the end it is worth the effort.  Still, Professor Bobbit's lack of self discipline in writing this behemoth did make me knock a star off the rating.  He does construct a solid and original model for viewing the history of the state, and I feel profitably applies it to the current turmoil of the day.  The book gets more speculative at the end, but the author is the first to say when he is launching into conjecture.  Reading these parts is not without value, but given the sheer size of this volume they should have been cut as an act of mercy.  In spite of this, the historical content is well researched and the ideas here are exciting.  Bobbit soberly and insightfully shows us how the state has evolved, and sheds light on how it is changing today.

Since the extravagant length of the book seems to be turning people away from a piece that should be read, however, let me say two things.  First, The Shield of Achilles is broken down into two major sections.  I read one, put it down for a few months, and came back.  That way I was not at any point overwhelmed.  Book I stands on its own without a problem, book II less so.  Two, with such an extended indoctrination into Professor Bobbit's way of thinking, you do walk away having a real handle on his ideas.  It is a bit like swallowing the idea whole, or perhaps vice versa.  Gird your whatever, develop a plan of attack, and read the book.  There's real gold in there, you just have to dig.
