I am always amazed by books written by women in a time period when they were seen as reserved and protected and uninformed, yet the novels reveal anything but that. It is clear why she won the pulitzer prize for this novel - and the first woman to do so at that! 
It was amazing that the main character - Archer Newland - is at once admirable and a snake at the same time. Ultimately my opinion of him was that of a coward. But the fact that Edith Wharton was able to relate that to her readers as a woman writing in the male character - is incredible. Two thumbs up
