I have found most of Dr. Lark's books to be professionally thorough and  have turned to them numerous times.  This time, however, I was a bit  disappointed.  She is too tentative in her exploration/explanation of  alternative or natural nutritional supplements to see us through menopause.   I am in the perimenopausal stage and have referred to my favorite site,  iHerb, for alternatives.  Based on iHerb's information, I have started on a  Black Cohosh blend and a wild yam cream that is helping.  Stay away from  DHEA, but go with the other, natural phytoestregers that  iHerb offers and  check out other books that are a bit braver in their endorsement of these  alternatives
