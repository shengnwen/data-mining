I ordered this book for my eight year old son and he loved it.  Although my son enjoys books, I usually have to persuade him to read something on his own.  However, my son was so anxious to finish the book that he took it everywhere with him for several days.  According to my son, Hugo Cabret is a very interesting character and anyone who reads the book will love it.
