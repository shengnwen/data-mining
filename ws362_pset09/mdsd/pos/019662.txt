Teresa's book would have come in handy as we raised our teenage children.  The book is a wealth of practical, tested, non-threatening, workable ideas that restore peace and harmony to a family.  Parenting Without Pressure requires consistency and commitment but the outcome will be worth the effort.  Children will learn responsibility and accountability and parents will learn what a blessing their children can be and that family is something to cherish and nurture.  An excellent tool that provides help and hope
