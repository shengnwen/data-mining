This is how I'd like to think the heavenly angels are watching over us.  This novel gives examples of how angels watch over and guide us without super-imposing God's will.  On the other hand, demons get right into our heads and experience extreme joy over the confusion they cause when we lose sight of our faith.

Although I would have liked to have experienced more emotion-filled moments during the read, I absolutely couldn't wait to find out how good-beats-evil.  A thought-provoking story that will leave you wondering...
