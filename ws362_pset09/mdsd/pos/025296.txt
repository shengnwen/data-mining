I Really like this book. As a professional motivational speaker, who is trained and experienced in many motivational disciplines, I find this book touches on some very key things that one needs to master in order to be a success. The part I found particularly relevant was the part on Career Acrophobia. This section really touches on why many people just don't get ahead. It explains the Glass Ceiling and Self Sabotage phenomena very well.

The only reason this book doesn't get a 5 star rating, is that it's a little weak on how to effectively address, the emotional issues it talks about. There are far more effective ways of addressing these issues, but this book does give you a good start.

I'd recommend it.
