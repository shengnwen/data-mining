A bold but selfless challenge to women who REALLY DO want a great marriage. The bottom line, in Linda Dillow's words: &quot;I'm not saying it's easy.  I'm saying it's well worth the effort!&quot;  For people who are ready to stop making excuses and open themselves up to some truths about how we can be used to bless or destroy our families.  If you liked The Power of a Praying Wife by Stormie Omartian, you'll love this practical and inspiring guide.  I truly hope I can meet Linda Dillow in person someday and thank her for her courage in writing this fabulous book
