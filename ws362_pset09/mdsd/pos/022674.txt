I've never been challenged as a Christian like this book has challenged me. It helped me realize what Jesus and Christianity is all about, and unfortunately, even though I've grown up in church and been a Christian for as long as I can remember, I never got it before. I've realized that talk is cheap. Action is what it's about. I've probably felt the most convicted after reading this book, realizing that I've called myself a Christian, but have rarely 'followed Jesus'. Isn't that what being a Christian is all about? Although I had my faith challenged, beliefs examined, and heart searched with this book, I didn't feel offended in any way, just completely sad for missing the point my whole life. I've found this book to be so important that I've bought 16 copies to give to my friends and family to read, I only have 6 left, and some of my friends have come and asked me for a copy to give to one of their friends. I don't believe it's possible for anyone to be disappointed by reading this book. There aren't strong enough words for me to use to explain how important I feel it is for you to read this book
