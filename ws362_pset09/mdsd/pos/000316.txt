This is a great early guide for those earlier pieces that you don't often see in the other costume/vintage jewelry guides and therefore often hard to tell what they are worth.  This book has plenty of pot metal made pieces, white rhinestone pave pieces, and lots of dress and fur clips.  This is not a guide for beginners in collecting.  My only disappointment would be the same I have with other guides - I would love to see the back of pieces; maybe not all of them of course, but I think it lends to a great education for the serious collector who isn't the most knowledgeable yet - like me! :)
