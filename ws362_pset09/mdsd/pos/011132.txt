Joseph Graves' The Emperor's New Clothes is a well-written exposition of the evidence for one single human race.  Graves correctly points out that the human species could have developed into separate races, but that it didn't happen.  This isn't a book of wishful thinking, but rather a book of hard science.  If there is a political slant to the book, I didn't find it noticable.  I enjoyed reading this book.  A familiarity with high school-level genetics is required for a full appreciation of Graves' arguments and  my 4-star rating is based on my feeling that Graves' intended this book for a wide audience, but wrote it beyond the level of many of the people it was intended for.  People who are ignorant of one subject tend to be ignorant of many subjects.  How many bigots actually paid attention in high school biology and remember their lessons in genetics
