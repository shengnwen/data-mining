As a social science student, I found this book invaluable in its incisive exposure of Eurocentrism.  The authors treat the subject in a mature manner, and offer an alternative, that of decentering the discussion and making it multi-centric rather than Euro-centric.  This book is sensitively written and does not offend Europeans, but seeks to reveal the hidden ways in which Eurocentrism manifests itself.  I experienced the reading of this book as liberating and as a validation of my own thinking.  I read a university library copy, but I intend to purchase a copy for my children to read - and to refer back to time and time again.  It is a timeless work
