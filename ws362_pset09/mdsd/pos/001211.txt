I wanted to read about the French Revolution, and began with "Citizens," by Simon Schama.  It is a fine book, but I got bogged down in the details, and was losing the essence of the events.  300 pages in, and still going through the details of the economic environment, I put down "Citizens" and picked up Hibbert's book.  It was beautifully written, and quite consistent with the highly-academic "Citizens."  But, frankly, Hibbert was much more enjoyable to read.

A note to those who are not adverse to detailed history: Schama has many favorable reviews on this site, and well-deserved.  But you might want to start with Hibbert, then go to Schama, with LeFebvre's slim work as a side read
