Please be aware that this book is about Alexander McCall Smith's other female detective, Isabel Dalhousie, rather than Precious Ramotswe.  For these stories we spend time in Edinburgh rather than Botswana and pursue formal philosophical ideas rather than the culturally based ones in Botswana.

Although there's plenty of philosophy in this book, those considerations don't take place as part of the Sunday Philosophy Club.  If you haven't read The Sunday Philosophy Club, I recommend that book to you before you read Friends, Lovers, Chocolate.

As the book opens, Isabel's niece, Cat, is about to go off to a wedding in Italy where Isabel suspects that the bridegroom's family connections in southern Italy might not be the most legal ones.  Isabel frets that Cat will find an inappropriate liaison of her own.  That fear is realized when an admirer follows Cat back from Italy.  

Isabel helps out at Cat's delicatessen while Cat's away, where Isabel ends up sharing a table with Ian.  This launches Isabel off into a moral investigation.  Ian is a heart donor recipient and has been having troubling dreams that feature a menacing face.  What could it mean?  Isabel's research puts her into some awkward situations that leave her honestly confused about what the right thing is to do.  

At the same time, Isabel finds herself shaken to realize that she may be about to lose her friendship with Jamie.  That makes her realize that her feelings for Jamie run deeper than mere friendship, despite the difference in their ages.

As before, many scenes turn out to be quite dramatic as Isabel finds herself unable to resist making the obvious, uncensored comment that cuts across the grain of social convention like a cheese slicer goes through hot brie.

It's good fun . . . but ultimately there's a sense of much ado about nothing that harms the book's appeal.
