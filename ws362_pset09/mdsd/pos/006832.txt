These Sophie Kinsella books are the best.  Honestly.  Probably second only to Bridget Jones in my chick-lit ratings.

Anyway, this story carries on the Shopaholic series with Becky finding out that she has a long-lost sister.  Oh fun!  A shopping buddy!  BFF necklaces!  HooRAY!

Only thing is, the sister hates shopping.  She's more of a nature girl.  Likes getting her clothes at goodwill and such.  

Madness ensues, of course.  What will Becky do to be close to her sister?  Will her sister hate her for being materialistic?  Oh the drama!

Funny book, worth the quick read
