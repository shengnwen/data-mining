Kaku attacks some very difficult subjects in Hyperspace. Subjects usually reserved for theoretical physicist and mathematicians.  Kaku not only adeptly conveys these supremely difficult subjects in a way that the average reader can understand, but also takes the reader on a well organized and engaging journey through the theory of everything.  If you have ever wondered if time travel will ever be possible, if other dimensions exist, or if humans will ever live on other planets in other galaxies then this book is for you.  It will give you the theoretical physicist's point of view on these mysterious subjects.  This book is supremely informative and wonderfully entertaining.  I gave it 4 1/2 stars instead of five, because of the last Chapter which was contrived and superfluous.
