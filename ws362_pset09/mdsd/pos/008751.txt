I read this text for a survey course on medieval history. I found the book to be better than most general history texts I've encountered in the past. The organization is superb and the writing is crisp and to the point. Oftentimes it was difficult to highlight anything because every sentence contains useful facts. Hollister writes with good humor in a subject that often lacks amusing anecdotes. The book starts with a brief view of Roman history and ends with the development of the Renaissance. There are chapters on Byzantium and Islam, as well as sections on medieval art, thought and architecture. Sidebars illuminate important medieval figures such as Hildegard of Bingen. Anybody reading this book will come away with a good foundation on medieval Europe
