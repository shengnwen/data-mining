My co-workers recommended this book. One loved it and the other hated it, both were intrigued by it, so I decided to give it a go, if nothing more than to serve as a tie-breaker.

As I began the novel, I found the author's style of writing inviting me to explore further, despite the story line's somewhat mundane beginnings. Martel is a marvelous story-teller! And when the ship sinks - fasten your seatbelts - you'll be swept off into a captivating world of adventure.  I could not put the book down at this point (although I did had to skip over the more gruesome details of feasting animals).

Since finishing the book two days ago, I find myself pondering it over and over, wondering which of the two versions was the true reality for Pi. 

As for my vote - I loved it and then I hated it, but I mostly liked it a lot
