I first reviewed Syd Hoff's "Danny and the Dinosaur" as a seven year-old. In second grade, we called it a book report, but my feelings on the book haven't changed. Danny's adventure includes a visit to the ballpark, which still has me smiling. Also, like hiding an elephant, Danny discovers playing hide-and-seek with a dinosaur can be difficult.

While the writing and drawings aren't on par with "Make for Ducklings," or "Mike Milligan and the Steam Shovel," it capably compares to H. A. Rey's "Curious George" series. "Clifford, the Big Red Dog" readers will connect with Danny playing with an oversized lizard.

The text is simple, and the story is sweet, unencumbered by the intentional messaging found in many modern children's books. It is just a fun, silly story. It helped me learn to read and to love books. Maybe Danny's tale can help your son or daughter read too.

I fully recommend "Danny and the Dinosaur" by Syd Hoff.
