a reader, you are clearly ignorant of the realities of adjuncting and grad school, and why it is not acceptable for universities to make hefty profits off of their students and then turn around and pay adjuncts and grad students sub-poverty wages.  The class I'm teaching right now at a state college pays $2800.  I'd have to teach ten classes a year to make $28k!  Four and four is the 'normal' load...lets see *you* teach four classes and then come home and read a little critical theory so you can finish your Phd.  What a reader sees as 'back to the sixties' and hostility is really a struggle by working people to make a living doing something they believe in, and what they believe in is being gutted of learning content and franchised and commercialized by corporations.  Yes it's true, a reader, and you shouldn't make light of the struggle of working people and intellectuals to fight for the power of education.  Pendejo
