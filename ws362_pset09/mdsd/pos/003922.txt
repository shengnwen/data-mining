Buy this for the gorgeous photographs and excellent lay out. There is no other reason. Who knows if the author really traveled the world like says she did photographing Faeries along the way?? The Faery photos aren't real, but supposed replicas of what she experienced. Again they are gorgeous. All of the literature may be pretend too. I really don't find it credible. There is an image of a Faery supposedly spotted in Scotland but the photo has bamboo and palm trees in the background - how could that be? It's beautiful anyhow. So enjoy the images and don't worry if the words next to each one are true
