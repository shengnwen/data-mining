Dr. John Gribbin has written a number of books on physics, and his sixth book, "Deep Simplicity: Bringing Order to Chaos and Complexity", covers the basics of chaos theory.  While I wouldn't call this book simple reading, he does make the subject very accessible for those willing to exercise their minds.  Dr. Gribbin does a very good job of explaining the origins of Chaos Theory, and how it applies to natural law from weather to earthquakes to life on Earth and the search for life elsewhere in the Universe.  He goes even further in looking at the behavior of man made phenomena such as traffic gridlock and the stock market

The content of this book gets five stars, but I do feel that it could have been organized more effectively.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning about chaos theory and how it relates to our place in the Universe.
