After reading King Leopold's Ghost, I was looking for a good synopsis of what happened in the post-colonial era.  After a few weeks of searching, I settled on In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz. Both were fascinating books that give great insight on the problems with the Congo.  Both are written in a style that is highly readable, entrhalling and at the same time informative.
