If you're into this sort of reading, this is not a bad way to spend an afternoon.  The author has apparently done a great deal of interviewing and research to write these stories, and they are well and thoughtfully written.  I, personally, wasn't interested in everyone in the book, but the stories of the last days of the people in which I was interested made me realize afresh that we are all, celebrity and non-celeb alike, common in our humanity, and are all traveling the same road to the same destination
