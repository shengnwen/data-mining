This book was an interesting case study review of financial forces that are shaping our universities.  While reading I found myself contemplating questions such as "Can schools preserve their heritage of `the disciplines of the mind' while adapting to the competitive pressures of the new millennium?"    Kirp has thoroughly investigated the problems and opportunities facing the funding and the recruiting practices of universities today.   It was fascinating to learn how courageous and creative leaders were able to turn their institutions around.  I would recommend this book to individuals who make decisions regarding the funding and on-going solvency of institutions of higher learning
