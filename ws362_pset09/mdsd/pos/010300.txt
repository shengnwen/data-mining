Sickened is a very sad book, but an excellent story that captures your attention and your heart. I can't believe Julie Gregory survived this kind of child abuse called Munchausen by Proxy. I had never heard of this type of child abuse, all I can say is that it's so horrible. 

Julie writes about the darkness of her childhood, a darkness caused by her own mother, a darkness in which her mother made her ill despite the fact that she was fine. It's hard to believe that parents can be this cruel and it really breaks my heart to know that there are thousands of children out there who go through this everyday. 

I would like to know what happened to her mother. I honestly think she needs to be locked up. People like her need help. 

It really takes courage to write about this. I thank Julie for writing about her painful past and helping some people learn about this form of child abuse. 

When I read it I couldn't help but remembering a quote I read a few months ago by Mitch Albom, "Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair."

I've never read a book this thrilling in all my life. I highly recommend everyone to pick up this touching real-life story and read it. Trust me; it gets to your heart.
