The prequel to "The Honourable Schoolboy"(see my Amazon review for October 28, 2001)and the first of the George Smiley trilogy. The ambivalent Jerry Westerby makes a cameo appearance. Readers see up close the machinations of the Circus and Whitehall and the ethically void or neutral cynicism, depending on one's point of view of strategic and tactical decision making in progress. No white hats here. Even the subtle cultural shades that divide mi6/mi5/special branch come to the surface.
