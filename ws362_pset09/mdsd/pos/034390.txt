I bought the book for my grandson, Connor.  He is 9 (4 when he was diagnosed with celiac)  He loved the book.  A book that was written for kids with celiac was just what he needed to read.  He has decided to donate it to the school library.  I thought this was a good choice.  A book others could read that had celiac or just to read to understand about the celiac person and how he copes with the celiac
