Seductress ~ Women Who Ravished the World and Their Lost Art of Love is an astonishing work with a contemporary feel. Yes, the author is opinionated but I find this lends passion to the work...an educated reader knows how to read the ideas of others without feeling offended or put upon to accept what is being said as their personal 'truth.'  It is Betsy's Prioleau's (and perhaps her editors) truth...and that is fine with me. I was given this book as a gift so I wasn't looking for self-help on how to seduce someone, as it seems the book has been marketed (judging from some of the negative comments and reviews on the back of the book) erroneously.  This isn't a self-help book, it is a book depicting women in history who have lived their lives to the fullest and gone against the grain of society when they had to in order to fulfill their destiny.  It is about women who were outcast by the herd of other women who were unable to embrace differences in others...despite being turned out, ridiculed, and tormented by society, these women followed their own path and blazed trails.  It is has been a truth throughout history (and indeed, today) that many people, particularly other women, do not like powerful women. Unfortunately, as one reviewer has noted, the majority of the population are 'sheep' and so how else was the author to depict them??  If you believe and adhere to whatever society teaches you and settle into an acceptable life, then that is your choice.  Why take offense when someone points it out to you when you read a book??  In that sense, perhaps the author will awaken a few people with her work.

If you love history or have an interest in Women's Studies, have an open mind, and believe in personal empowerment, this book is for you.  But don't buy it looking for straightforward advice on how to seduce a man...you may learn something through the stories of the women written about in this book, but then you'd be following someone else again, wouldn't you
