Rock'n'roll is fifty years old now, and it shows no signs of slowing down, going away, or even turning off that darn racket. The five lengthy essays in this book discuss many of the elements that have contributed to its longevity: the taboos of sexuality and race, the roles played by radio and tv, how the music now dominates the commercial marketplace (and has been turned into a commodity itself), why it still carries the sense of teenage rebellion.
