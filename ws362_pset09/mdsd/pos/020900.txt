Its true, this book does exactly what the author set out to do. To show us a list of different shots from the dolly to the crane, with simple illustrations. Those who gave the book bad reviews completely missed the point entirely. If you want a "real" book on shot composition and directing get Katz's "shot by shot" Actually I recommend buying both books together. I read Jeremy Vineyard's book in one day and took several notes. For those who think the book was too basic, well you have to start with baby steps and this book definetely helped me. An invaluable reference guide for any newbie filmmaker. Jeremy thanks for taking the time out to watch all those movies and pointing the shots out. Trust me its worth it
