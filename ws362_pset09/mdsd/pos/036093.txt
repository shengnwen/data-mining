Really, the best word to describe this book is, "WHAT?", because once you finish reading it, that's pretty much what you're feeling. While reading the book, everything seems strange and confusing, and even when you're done, it's still very strange and confusing. Keeping track of the time and situation is especially hard, and very often you'll totally forget what story within a story within a story you're reading, which can be even more mind numbing and baffling.

But this is part of what makes this book as special as it is. Some parts are incredibly funny (which at times seems grotesquely out of place, for example, the musical they put on is extremely amusing, yet seems so inappropriate that it's actually hilarious), and other parts are surprisingly thoughtful. The book jumps all over the place, yet unlike most books that travel all over the place, this one is solid, and if it was straight-forwards it would lose much of its confusing charm.

I rated this a four rather than a five mostly because it's not for everyone. I enjoyed it, but for those of you who prefer your books to be simple and forwards, I would suggest you pick up another book. This requires a flexible mind, and one that has no issues with eyebrows shooting up in surprise or a spinning head. If you have no issues with these things, enjoy. Don't let the empty star fool you; it's an intersting book to read, and can be very enjoyable.
