I know it's a cliche but it's the truth! I think this would be my favorite Coulter to date. I don't care if it isn't well researched... I didn't recognize the discepencies as I am not a scholar of Regency history and culture. It was fun and I enjoyed the interaction between the characters. It was certainly not boring. I would read it again.
