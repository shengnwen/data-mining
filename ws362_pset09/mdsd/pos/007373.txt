Having been introduced to Cadfael by Mystery Theater (I blush to admit I watch the tube...occasionally), I was pleasantly surprised to find the books so much richer and well developed than the relatively faithful television renderings. I've read all twenty Cadfael Chronicles--twice--and urge prospective readers to start here and go through them in order. Some of the background plots make more sense. That said, each stands admireably on it's own feet, so read whatever you find. 

Peters' fault, perhaps, was that she was a writer of formulaic mystery novels...of which these are. Long before there's even a body, you will usually have figured out who will be accused, who will really have done it, and who the romantic interest of that particular tale is/are. No matter. Medieval Shrewsbury is rendered by the late "Ellis Peters" with enough care and wit to provide many a good evening's reading. That Cadfael is a thoroughly post-modern man helps us find our way through a time and culture which we probably wouldn't recognize otherwise. Enjoy
