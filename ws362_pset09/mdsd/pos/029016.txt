i thought this book to be somewhat hard for the "non-painter" to grasp yet the exercises were lovely.  i did this with a friend, a non-painter and she is a very creative soul, however this did not suit her needs and for that i am very sorry.

having all of my art being self-taught, i was more able to grasp what Ms. Beam's exercises were alluding to, however,  i really wanted to share this with a girlfriend and not a painterly one.  
great read though, and Ms. Beam's time was definietly well spent on this one
