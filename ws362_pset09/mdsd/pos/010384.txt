I've read this book, and this series, twice, with a span of twenty-some years in between. When I first read it, I liked the characters, images, and story, but the language seemed deliberately over-complicated and intellectual. Now, after re-reading it, I think that I just wasn't ready for it the first time. 

After thousands of years, as far as The Land is concerned, but a short time, as far as Thomas Covenant is concerned, our hero again finds himself suddenly thrown back into The Land. However, it's almost unrecognizable, as everything is weirdly corrupted. Again, without fully accepting its reality, Covenant does what he can to battle evil and restore The Land to its past beauty and magic. He still does not have fill control of the white gold magic, but he now must be the driving force to save The Land, instead of a tool, as the people of The Land are either locked into a mode of surviving one day at a time, or they have given up. 

Thomas Covenant is still ornery, irritable, and depressed, but he continues to recover some of who he was before the leprosy. 

This is the first book of the new trilogy and the fourth book in the series. The first three can stand alone, and the second trilogy probably could, as well, but it is best to think of this series as a sextet. Donaldson continues to have characters that are deep and well-developed; complicated, intelligent, and extremely sophisticated writing (the exact opposite of Hemingway's stunning simplicity and not far off from Faulkner's esoteric and obtuse complexity); and a riveting story. This is NOT a quick, easy read. This IS deep, major fantasy on an epic scale
