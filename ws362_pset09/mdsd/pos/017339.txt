I have read all of Joanne Fluke mysteries to date.  I have been getting them from the library and then typing the recipes I like into my computer before returning the book.  I enjoy Hannah Swensen and I really enjoy the recipes.  I have adapted them to a diabetic diet and they are great!  When I found there were over a hundred pages of recipes in this book I was so pleased and decided to buy this one for my cookbook collection.  I highly recommend all of the Hannah Swensen books if you like good clean mysteries with great recipes.  I hope she keeps writing forever..
