In his book Bruce Bawer outlines the negative impact of immigration policies in Western Europe. Essentially Bawer points out that instead of encouraging integration, Western Europe focuses on multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is the idea that new cultures maintain a separate identity, even though immigrants have taken up residence in a new nation (ideally multiculturalism is acceptance of all cultures; but that is rarely seen in reality). 

Multiculturalism in Western Europe has created a culture of fear. A culture so fearful of offending Muslims, that Westerners are sacrificing their freedoms and liberties to appease a growing Muslim minority. The combination of Islam's intolerance for the West and the West's fear of being perceived as racist has led to a society where Dutch women wear hijabs (traditional Muslim head covers) in public for fear of being raped. The murder rate in Sweden has increased to nearly double that of the United States.
 
The only hope for Europe, Bawer claims, is for Europeans to take a tough stance on extremism. Europe must punish, deport and deny entry to people who preach hate. Europe must be willing to force immigrant children to go to secular schools and force immigrants themselves to learn the national language. Europeans must be willing to defend their freedoms; otherwise we'll see a Europe ruled by sharia law (strict literal implementation of the Koran's law).
