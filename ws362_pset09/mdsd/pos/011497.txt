After a certain amount of misdirection at the outset of this novel, Mrs. Gaskell quickly gets to the central themes. Margaret Hale has traveled with her family from the rural South of England to the industrial North. At the time of her arrival the cotton workers are agitating for better working conditions; it is then that she meets the capable but bull-headed manufacturer Mr. Thornton (she finds his mother even more intolerable). When Margaret comes to Thornton's aid during an ugly mob scene, he thinks she does so because of her feelings for him - feelings he misinterprets as love. He proposes marriage, but she refuses. But, of course, Margaret has a change of heart and after numerous complications, they are finally united.

Gaskell handles very well the duel theme of worker unrest and the unrest that exists between Margaret and Thornton. The passions that motivate the workers are finally seen by Margaret to be similar (in power, in their sexuality) to the ones coming to the surface in Margaret herself. The novel is overly sentimental in spots (the death of Margaret's mother is particularly overdrawn), and Gaskell's plain, dampened prose is a weakness in her style. But she shows much sympathy for the plight of the workers, and Margaret comes to appreciate their concerns. Not as good (or as well-liked) as her CRANFORD, the novel is a decent enough portrait of life in an industrialized city during the Victorian period.
