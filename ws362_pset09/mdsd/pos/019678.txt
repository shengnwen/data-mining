At first glance, this seems like a text on early childhood education for sociologists, psychologists, early child educators, and college students only.  As you get into the text, however, you find that the end of numerous chapters are dedicated to parents who want to give their children the best learning opportunities possible at home.  Super book for parents that aren't interested in farming their kids out to daycare as soon as possible.  Primary caregivers (moms or dads) this is excellent reading to give you a boost if you're thinking your job at home isn't really important and critical to your child's future
