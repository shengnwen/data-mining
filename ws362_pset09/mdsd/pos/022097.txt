 One of the most significant photographers of the twentyith century, Irving Penn's captivating photographs throughout his career are wonderfully showcased in this book. from his humble beginnings as a graphic dsigner in the 1940's to his portraits of the native peoples from the far reaches of the world-Penn's work has had a major impact on not only the world of photography but aslo the art world as a whole. This retrospective of Penn's body of work is much more thorough than expected. 
 The graphic quality of his work really speaks to me as a graphic desiner; weather it be his rich photographs of nude women or his famous portraits of politicans, actors and fashion models. The numerous illustrations of Penn's well-known corner shot were a nice surprise in the book; many of these images are very difficult to find on the internet, it was great being able to study the nuances of the portraits up close. A beautiful and informative book that any Penn fan would love
