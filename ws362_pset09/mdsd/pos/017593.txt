This series has always been something of a guilty pleasure for me.  Yes, there's still Roark, but he is less involved with the case than he once was.  I love the cast of characters, the crisp, witty dialogue, and Eve's constant battle with her cars and the chocolate thief.  But there were also scenes that brought tears to my eyes and others that made me catch my breath in suspense.  The books in this series are always good reads
