The Blue Sword is about a girl named Harry Crewe. She is an orphan that loves the desert where she lives, but she wants more. Corlath, King of the Hillfolk takes Harry and brings her back to his hills. She learns to ride the hill horses, speak their language, and she becomes a warrior. Soon, she becomes one of the King's Riders. She is given Gonturan, the blue sword, which once belonged to Aerin that is in the book 'The Hero And The Crown' which takes place before 'The Blue Sword'. Harry goes on a journey against Corlath's will and on this journey, Gonturan and Corlath help Harry. When she returns from her journey she and Corlath admit their love for each other. This book is a great fantasy that has a lot of adventure, but it happens in a calm way. I would recommend that you start with 'The Hero And The Crown' and if you like that, which I did, then you should like this book, 'The Blue Sword'
