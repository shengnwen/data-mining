This book provides a conceptual bridge between Hannah Arendt's famous "banality of evil" thesis and the more recent thesis presented by Giorgio Agamben that the concentration camp is the paradigm of political modernity. It has affinites with the post-holocaust ethics of Primo Levi and Judith Shklar as well. In the context of recent attempts to give torture and indefinite detention the imprimatur of law, Bauman's book serves as a reminder that formalizing or bureaucratizing these activities is not likely to humanize these practices-- for example, scientifically "humane" methods of execution or legally proscribed torture warrants-- but rather to erode moral resistance and sensibilities.
