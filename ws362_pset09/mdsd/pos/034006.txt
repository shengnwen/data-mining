Unlike Hans Christian Anderson, the Brothers Grimm did not invent new fairy tales but collected old ones, with the intention of preserving the oral tradition of the German peasantry.  Whether in fact they fulfilled that intention has been questioned.  Their tales do afford a glimpse of a world of castles and forests, nobles and peasants, superstitious beliefs and primitive practices that suggest origins at least as old as feudal Europe, and often much older.  Some of the tales have been traced back through the centuries by way of earlier versions until they disappear into prehistoric times
