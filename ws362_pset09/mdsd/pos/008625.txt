This book is quite cute from an entertainment perspective.  Farmer Bill wakes up to a snowstorm one day to find that he is missing one of his mittens.  When he goes to his barns, he discovers one by one, that each of his animals is missing a mitten (be prepared to explain what a cow's udder is for!).  They finally see the goat at the top of the hill who is the culprit - he's munching on all the mittens!  When they're all inside, the goat decides to make lunch on Farmer Bill's new coat.  Very cute story and throughout the book, the illustrations indicate how many mittens the animals have (i.e. three for the cow) and "odd" is written under the three mittens, and the next picture is of four mittens with "even" written under them.  Right now, my little one thinks that odd means just "weird" so that concept is coming a little slowly.  Be prepared to go into a full explanation of numbers when you read this book.  It definitely takes some time to do but the story makes it well worth it.  Ours has to be read nightly.  Highly recommend
