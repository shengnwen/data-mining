I read a lot of spiritual or metaphysical books but this one is definately one of the best, most personally useful ones. I just started it yesterday and although I am only half way through I am so excited by the information within I could not wait to rave about it and recommend it to family and friends. It is so enlightening to me in explaining my negative thought patterns and how programming from childhood has influenced my entire life. No wonder Louise Hay is a guru to so many new age type authors. I am reading sections aloud to my husband. I am underlining passages to re-read later. I see myself so clearly in the examples given as well as other people I love in my life. Although I did not buy this book through Amazon like many others I've read, I would most definately purchase it again for a gift or advise somebody I really cared for that could use this kind of revelation to buy it. My copy is the earlier printing (1984) so I can only assume more recent re-printing dates are at least as good or improved. Do not hesitate. You need to read this book. You deserve it and can really benefit from it
