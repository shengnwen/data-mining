This book is a valuable extrapolation of the adage "By the yard is hard; by the inch it's a cinch."  It uses the concept of Kaizen or continuous improvement via small steps to help people achieve goals.  Maurer's neurological explanations are consistent, though he does not back them up with references, with current neurological knowledge about how the brain adapts to circumstances and helps change behavior, i.e., by taking small Kaizen steps, a person bypasses the amygdala's fight-or-flight response, and allows the individual to gradually but surely progress towards their goals.  This book confirms what other self-help authors have advised - take that first step, however small, toward your goals, and take another one the next day, however small.  You will eventually gain momentum and achieve what you desire
