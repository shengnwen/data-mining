This is a very sweet and wonderful story about a boy who is rocking on his mother's lap.  He gathers all sorts of things from around the room and they  continue to rock.  When his mom suggests his baby sister join them he isn't thrilled but they all fit and he is happy.  I read this story to my group of two year olds and they absolutely love it.  We rock back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  And we discuss how there really is always room on mom's lap.  This story is timeless and enjoyed by Toddlers to Kindergarteners
