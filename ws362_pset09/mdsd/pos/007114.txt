This is just a wonderful little guide to help those who may have little or no background in Latin to take a dip in the pool of the language.  Although, no, this is not the volume that will provide you with medievalist-like fluency in the language at the completion of the book, it is a great survey.  

I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in getting a taste of Latin and what might be involved in further study of the language.  Go ahead, get your feet wet
