I was surprised that on the, "Dry Beans & Nuts" page of this book, peanuts were listed as a nut. Maybe the author wanted to teach that peanuts can be a source of protein, but I don't like the idea of teaching inaccurate information! These days, people learn that nuts grow on trees, that peanuts are not nuts and  they grow under the ground. Has the author read any food allergy articles describing peanuts as a legume related to the pea or bean? Or her editor? Fortunately, peanuts were listed close to the "Dry Beans" list, because other legumes such as peas and lentils were also listed
