As a big March Madness fan, I couldnt help but check this book out from my local library. I love college basketball and especially the "Big Dance". This book is a great look behind the scenes at the Final Four and is full of valuable insight and interesting side stories. 
Feinstein does a great job of really capturing the essence of the Final Four and the magnitude of the event from a coaches and players perspective.
My favorite chapter is the chapter on the unsung players, the walk-ons the players that won't ever step foot on a NBA court and for them this is the pinnacle of their athletic career.
I also enjoyed reading about the coaches, officials, and players that make the Final Four the greatest weekend in sports. A must read for the college basketball fan and a highly recommended one for anyone that loves sports
