I read this book for my term paper for 8th grade on the Politics of the Olympics.  We could choose any topic from history, so that's what I chose, because I'm a swimmer.  It was really helpful and interesting.  It's sad there's so much fighting that has nothing to do with the sports, but that's the way the world is.  I wish I could take Prof. Senn's college course
