This book is not high literature, nor is it meant to be.  Jean Raspail's parable and caricature of what is to come, once seemingly so surreal, now approaches the documentary. Routine events of our day: Hollywood celebrities clamor to adopt Third World babies as if they were puppies in the window; Four decades of mass legal and illegal immigration now swiftly transform America town-by-town; Countless Orwellian "celebrations," often compulsory, as in schools, trumpet ever more "multiculturalism" and "diversity;" Finally, as in Raspail's scenario, none of these bizarre developments can be effectively criticized without critics becoming socially censored or professionally tarred.  Would any Third World nation be considered "racist" or filled with "hate" if it did not want a European majority?  Of course not. 

Given that inhabitants of non-Western nations would not for one minute entertain policies bringing about their steady demographic diminishment, while enlightened Westerners from Scandinavia to Australia must applaud their own, or at the very least pronounce it "inevitable," you have to wonder if previous besieged collapsing civilizations were likewise first rendered intellectually defenseless.  We have become our own Trojan horse.

"Camp of the Saints" will one day be judged prophetic, with copies likely preserved into the far future in major libraries around the world wherever coherent unapologetic civilizations remain, likely Asian and Islamic.
