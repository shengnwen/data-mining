This is an important book. It explains what is known about Schizophrenia broadly and includes suggestions for further reading. I can't imagine a better guide for families and consumers, although for professionals, the information is fairly basic. I enjoyed looking through this book because Dr. Torrey writes personably , making it an invaluable resource for those who are surviving Schizophrenia
