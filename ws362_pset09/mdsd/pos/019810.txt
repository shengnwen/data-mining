Fertility Awareness is more than a reliable, low-tech way to prevent or achieve pregnancy based on changes in body temperature and cervical mucus.  It's a wise way for women to become aware of the rhythms of their own bodies and for their partners to share in this awareness.  This essential first step will help solve America's epidemic of reproductive problems ranging from painful menstrual cycles to loss of sex drive to infertility.   Singer profoundly understands the myriad ways that diet, lifestyle and environment affect reproductive health and provides an excellent  discussion of the vital role that traditional animal products and healthy fats play in reproductive health and the risks of supposedly healthy low-fat products, soyfoods and other highly processed modern food products.  As a Clinical Nutritionist, I have worked with many infertile female clients, many of whom were "health conscious" vegetarians or near vegetarians.  Nearly all of these women regained their fertility, strengthened their overall reproductive health and just plain felt better after removing soy foods from their diets and adopting a varied, omnivorous diet rich in both protein and fat.  Men also benefit from eliminating soy foods because the plant estrogens lower testosterone levels, diminish the libido and adversely affect both the quality and quantity of sperm.  In short, if you value your sexuality and reproductive health, follow ALL the excellent advice in this book.
