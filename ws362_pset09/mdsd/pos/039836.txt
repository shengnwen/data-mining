Only 199 pages yet I wanted to underline every word.  So many wise assessments on the human race and its avariciousness, stupidity and recklessness during the miniscule time it has occupied planet Earth.  The synopsis of John Gray's book is that if we continue with our ego-centric attitude and destructive acts on this planet there will be only one survivor, and it won't be the human race.  The planet has its protective mechanism and we will go the way of the dinosaurs.
