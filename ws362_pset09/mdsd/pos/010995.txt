Plot:  I had never read an 'Alex Delaware' book before, and am always a bit leary picking up a book in a series of books because I may not understand the workings of the character built up before the novel I happen to read.  However, this book was well written and so detailed I didn't feel like I had ever missed a thing.  Written from the point of view of Alex, as well as his best friend, Milo, you really get a sense of the character's motives and flaws.  Another thing I enjoyed about this story is that it is not a predictable ending, and it didn't feel forced.  I hate when a book feels like it just hurried up and tied all the loose ends so it can wrap up.  I never got that feeling from this book, which was a joy. 

From the Audio standpoint:  I have never heard an audio book where the reader did such a superb job.  I truly felt that I was listening to a variety of characters, each had their own pitch, inflection and you could hear the emotions in the voice.  I could put in a tape at random and tell you what character was speaking, even though there were well over 10 characters in this storyline.  Very well represented!
