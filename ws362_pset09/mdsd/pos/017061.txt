I enjoyed reading the book.  I praise the author for his hard work and his motivation to improve himself and his life.  I do agree with another reader that the author very often patted himself on the back, which I have concluded that it's a weakness of a person who had a difficult life.
Although the author often patted himself on the back, but terms he used to describe feelings, places and situations were touching and close to heart. Over all, it's a good book to read and to learn what Chinese people had to do to survive the Mao's time
