Sherry Rogers was my doctor for a number of years.  She was always ahead of her time and now it shows!  All of her books are wonderful, informative, easy to read and life saving.  I hope everyone gets as much from this and all her books as I have.  You'll be amazed at how much you DON'T know about your body, the environment and how we are killing ourselves until you read these books.  Trust me, I am only a consumer here, but I pass these books on to everyone I care about and have for years!  I'm going to post this to all the books I have read by Sherry.  I just can't say enough about this woman.  She literally saved my life (allergies, life and health threatening mineral and vitamin deficiencies) and my husband's too (bladder cancer). Love,  Susan Mancheste
