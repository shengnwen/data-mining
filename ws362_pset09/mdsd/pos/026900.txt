Donald Crew admirably captures the nighttime look and feel of a state fair in this beautifully illustrated kids' book.  Using gouache and watercolor, his vivid primary colors contrasts the dark sky with the dazzling neon signs.  One can practically feel the electricity pulsing from the bright lights, and the diffusion of light emits a magical energy.  This super luminosity also enables readers to view the faces and emotions of the diverse crowd: romantic couples, excited kids, hungry teens, and pleased parents.

The book's spare prose grasps the essence of the fair's main delights:  Food ("So many things to eat and drink. So many choices."), games and prizes ("So many games to play."), and rides (And now, on to the RIDES!"). There are no animals in Crew's fair; this is strictly a food and rides extravaganza, at least during the night. The rides coverage spans 12 pages, culminating in "The best, the best ride of all...the GIANT FERRIS WHEEL!" The story concludes with a 2-page spread showing the fairgrounds from the top of the Ferris wheel, and a line of people happily leaving the grounds. As in a picture book, some of the ride pictures have no caption, it's as if Crews anticipated the awe of his young readers. The book has a big "WOW" factor, mainly due to Crews' outstanding feeling for the electric atmosphere of the fair.

Obviously, Crews idealizes the Fair: It is blanketed by uniformly happy customers in a clean and wholesome environment.  I've experienced nothing quite like this. Even in the most controlled venues such as Disneyland, one invariably encounters crying toddlers, parents arguing with their kids and with each other, exorbitant prices, and long lines. However, since this is a book for kids, Crews wisely excludes these details. As a result, he recreates a child's bedazzling experience of  a fair's excitement and wonder.
