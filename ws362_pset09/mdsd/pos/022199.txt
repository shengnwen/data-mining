Following-up on the Investment Biker travelogue, Rogers decides to take this trip in the comforts of an AMG spruced up car.  While traveling to more locations and experiencing more life-changing events (death of father, marriage), Roger's 2nd world travel account lacks the cutting adventure of the first. Unique to it's moment in history the first explored the vastly changing political and economic changes that occured with the overnight end of the Cold War, while this account alienates its field description due to a more distanced and experienced writer, as well as more entrenched world situation.

Just as winning a 2nd championship doesn't compare to the first, going around the world and being exposed to things you could never describe or fully understand unless there in person is mitigated by a 2nd serving. Upon trying a new fruit, the possibilities and diversions are endless, but upon experiencing the taste, texture, and terrain of a fruit, analagous to a geographic continent, becomes less revelatory and more familiar. Despite the more distanced, more fragmented, and less nuanced description of each area, this is still an amazing account, few of which can match living in the world today
