This book is great.  I highly recommend it if you have limiting beliefs you want to overcome.  You know the idea of "glass half empty half full."  You can put a spin on things to make something resourceful/positive rather than negative.  Well, this book explains 26 different patterns to do just that.  Do the exercises, which require a lot of deep thinking, and you'll see negative beliefs transform to something resourceful and thus empowering.  As I did the exercises, I felt a shift on how I viewed some limiting beliefs; it was as if weight was lifted from my shoulders.  
I've heard others describe Mindlines as a tough read.  There were parts where I had to read a second time around to get a full understanding.  But other than that, I don't consider it tough at all.  The book assumes readers are familiar with NLP.  If you are unfamiliar with NLP, there will be parts in the book where you'll be like, "What the hell's he talking about?!"  But you will still reap the benefits if you do the exercises.  Great book!  (As mentioned in another review, there are a ton of typos!  Out of all the books I've read, this tops the list for the most)
