Deborah Harrison is the affluent and intelligent daughter of an important businessman.  One day, on her way home from St. Mary's school, she is strangled in a graveyard.  The residents of the Yorkshire town of Eastvale are shocked by her death, and Deborah's father is pressuring the police to come up with a suspect quickly.  Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks is called in and he, along with his colleagues, arrest an English teacher for the crime.  Peter Robinson does some interesting things in &quot;Innocent Graves&quot;.  He tells a good part of the story through the eyes of the arrested man, Owen Pierce, who swears that he is innocent.  We experience Owen's panic and bitterness as he is processed through the criminal justice system and stands trial for a crime that he claims he did not commit.  Robinson once again shows how difficult and painstaking police work is.  Banks and his colleagues must interview dozens of people over a period of months to get to the truth.  The patience and the perseverance of the Eastvale police force are strained to the breaking point during this case. The ending is a bit melodramatic and not completely believable.  However, in spite of a few minor flaws, &quot;Innocent Graves&quot; is an engrossing mystery and a wonderful character study
