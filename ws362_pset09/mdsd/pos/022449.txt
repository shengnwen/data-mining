The title of this work is a bit misleading.  The first three or so chapters stick pretty well to the subject, but then the author starts to indulge in a bit of rambling.  I do feel you that when you read this work, you must remember at which end of the political spectrum Mr. Schlesinger is shooting from.  While he brings forth many valid points, ones we should give more than passing thought to, we have to realize that many of his statements are colored by his liberal mind set.  This is certainly okay, but we do have to keep it in mind.  Many of the more current events the author addresses, we simply will not be able to evaluate for a number of years.  Speculative history is just fine and dandy as long as you realize what it is your reading.  All in all though, I admire Schlesinger's work and certainly recommend you read this one.  As I said, it does give you some thoughts to ponder, agree or disagree
