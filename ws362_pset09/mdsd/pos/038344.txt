I picked this up at my local used book store, just because of the cover and it sounded interesting. glad i did. it turned out to be funny and hardwarming. i could relate to these ladies(even being a little younger!)and found my self wishing i had such a group of wonderful, funny and just plain great ladies in my life. that's ok, I bought the sequel and laughted and enjoyed just as much. i just wish there were more books
