Like most of the reviewers here, I'm a member of that exclusive club who lost a child.  I was given partial solace by leaders of the local chapter of Compassionate Friends which specializes in grief counselling.  All the leaders and participants have paid a huge price to join, but nothing monetary.  The glue holding it together is the loss of a child.  

This author must have received comfort in writing while passing the time...time in the short term is your enemy.  When enough time passes, the pain eases, although it never goes away.  In the early months it's hard to concentrate because the grief keeps popping up without permission.  I took solace in learning a few pieces on the piano which were way over my head, and doing an extensive photograph editing project about my lost child - a way for me to spend months making the time pass.  Our author grieved by writing down his thoughts.  My wife read lots of books on grief, but most of them were not my cup of tea.  I found an isolated book or passage now and then which connected with me, and I actively looked for them.  The usual grief counsellor doesn't have a clue, not from lack of sympathy or effort.  
   
  It's been 8 years now since my loss, so I'm not needy for solace, but I'm always ready to hear another man's story...and what a story this is.  This book is a day by day pouring out of expressions of grief done in an effort to heal that which can never be entirely healed.  I count it amongst those few books that would have been of benefit to me in the first year of my loss.  My sympathies go to the author and his family, and my sincere appreciation goes to him  for the sharing of his story.
