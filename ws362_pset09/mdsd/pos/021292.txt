This was one of my daughter's favorite books when she was little, so I was delighted to find it still in print to buy for her children.  Oscar Otter is a playful young fellow who is annoyed when a beaver gets in the way of his slide, so he decides to build the world's longest otter slide.  In the process he sees new places and has an unexpected and thrilling adventure which teaches him a lesson.  Young readers will enjoy the thrills and laughs generated by the text and the charming and amusing illustrations
