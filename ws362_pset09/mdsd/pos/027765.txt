This was such a great book, it had a little bit of everything, history, mike's biography and some little stories, it was so great I found it SO intersting. I'm not a huge history person but the way he put it in there it was interesting and I WANTED to read it... some of it was a little confusing the way he had it in there and parts were eh... but over all this book was great and i loved it
