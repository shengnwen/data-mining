I bought this book for information on the subject upon which i like to study, hallucinogens, specifically tryptamine hallucinogens. Andrew Weil in this book does cover almost every drug, either legal or illegal, and in an unbiased fashion, noting the Pro's and Con's of each drug, namely dependence, affects, pharmacological uses etc.. On each drug, he explains the legality of them, thorougly, and where they fit in to society, which is important that i feel many other authors of the same subject have absent from their works, specifically speaking. One phrase Weil says which i think has immense credibility, is &quot;There is no such thing as a bad drug, just bad relationships with drugs&quot; and this book is riddled with phrases keyed to that effect. It is important to realize that people make decisions based on the basis of the information available to them, and we are in a sitiuation of propaganda, ill information for the reasons clandestine. This book very well puts all cards on the deck, and voices its opinion with no preconceived consequences for the information put forth. This book is up with Food of the Gods - Terence Mckenna and other books which have penetrated the thick barrior of governmental consequences. Highly recommended for those just getting interested in subjects which pertain to altered states of consciousness, student and teacher alike
