This is an astoundingly well-researched book. Dunn's work on the titles ascribed to and/or accepted by Jesus started a fruitful debate on the subject -- a debate to which he continued to contribute. Since the discussion has progressed beyond this book, it is somewhat dated; but it is foundational and still of primary value. To understand recent scholarship in Christology, one needs to be familiar with this book.
For the novice, I might recommend beginning with Part Four of Dunn's "Jesus Remembered" and, if your appetite is stimulated, following with this more in-depth (although earlier) treatment
