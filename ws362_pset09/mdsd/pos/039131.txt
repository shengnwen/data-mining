Political scandals, judicial controversies and an extortion plan that will make three disgraced former judges very rich and powerful men make up this fast-paced thriller. 

The Brethren have waited for just the right time--the right moment. And that moment has come. While the country is distracted by a presidential election with its own ulterior motives, the three judges have targeted their next victim.

I found this novel to be very entertaining and pure Grisham at his best. His characters are multi-dimensional, human and evil, and exploit the adage of "how far are you willing to go to get what you want?'

Still, my favorites remain The Client and The Pelican Brief.

Overall, John Grisham packs a punch and hits his target every time. Kudos!
