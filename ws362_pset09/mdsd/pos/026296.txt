The strongest features of this book are the extensiveness of the research on the numerous architects from the early part of the 20th century in the US, and the period photographs showing what many of the most famous courses looked like before others could alter them.

The Golden Age, as it is called, came just after people began to realize that golf courses needed to be something more than strait shots down alleys surrounded by bunkers. Men who had experienced golf in its native form in Scotland brought back their insights to the US and transformed the alleys into true adventures across the landscape. Sadly, many of them had been all but forgotten until a resurgence of interest in the art of golf design. American golf architecture again was stagnating, and new inspiration was needed.

Geoff Shackelford has stood by the pirnciples of many of the architects he discusses in this volume, and as such takes great care in his descriptions of thier lives, influences, and design philosophies.

Although not as intense a discussion of arcitecture itself that may be found in the writings of the individual architects, Shackelford's overviews combined with the numerous photographs of exemplary holes helps make clear what many of them intended with thier creations.

Of greatest interest is the attention he gives the "Philadelphia School", which includes Pine Valley creator George Crump. The details of how Pine Valley came to be, and how the group out of Philadelphia went on to inspire one another and spread the gospel of golf will be of interest to most
