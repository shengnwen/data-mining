I almost think this book is misnamed. Covering Genesis through Revelation, it serves more as an overview of the books of the Bible in its order, including providing background, author, theme, and other information that you would expect in a study Bible or commentary. This is fine. The charts are available throughout, but they are quite simplistic and are not really in any order. Of course, you can look in the index for help, but unless you know what you are looking for, a particular chart or map might be hard to find. For instance, they have a small chart on Christ's superiority at the end of the section on Hebrews. Unless you knew that was there, how would you ever find it? Although this book is fine, if you are searching for clearer and more detailed charts and maps, let me recommend the Holman Book of Charts and Maps. I think this would be a better buy, if I had to choose between the two
