"Black Cross" takes us to the darkest hours of the Nazi regime. It is an action/adventure novel, but very detailed and realistic. The story builds up and the last 100 pages are a rollercoaster. 

I don't want to give details of the plot, just to say that if you like action, adventure and II World War era stories, "Black Cross" stands out as one of the best.
