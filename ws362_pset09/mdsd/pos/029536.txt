This book contains so many intriguing recipes that I couldn't wait to try! I spent a few days experimenting eagerly with the ones that particularly caught my eye: Pumpkin-Chocolate Chip Muffins (devoured by the whole family!), Ladda's Lemon Ginger Muffins (my daughter exclaimed, "There's a yummy burst of lemon flavor from the first bite!"), White Chocolate with Raspberry Muffins, Cafe Crumble Muffins, and even French Onion Soup Muffins. I can't wait to try out more of the recipes--such as Orange Cardamom Muffins and Steven's Sun-Dried Tomato Muffins (with spinach). 

If you're not used to healthful baking, some of the ingredients might sound foreign, but find a natural foods store or a well-stocked grocery store, and give them a try--they're not only better for you than the white flour and sugar varieties but taste great, too! Pair these muffins with a salad or soup for a lovely, inspired meal. 

In my opinion, you can't go wrong with a cookbook that contains a recipe for Seven-Factors-of-Enlightenment Muffins! Making these recipes is like a mindfulness meditation--you can slow down and savor the subtle aromas, flavors, and the interaction between the different ingredients, knowing  you're creating something that's wholesome for your body, mind, and soul.
