I'm a man and I'm getting into woodworking.  I'm good with my hands and have built basic furniture pieces but never learned technical stuff.  I've been reading magazines and looking for a good woodworking book.  I came across this one by "accident".  It was mis-shelved.  Curiosity got me and I flipped through it.  I was really impressed.
1. It's very clear.  2. It comes from good experience.  3. It's concise. 4. This lady has some creative touches in her furniture design. 5.  It's no-nonsense construction.  This is fine woodworking made simple. 6. It's more than 101...I'd say it's 101-401.  7. This book is better than several I have seen or purchased.  It is a good book as a compliment to other books.
This is not your encyclopedia.  It's not a large book with 20 projects.  It's small with only a few
