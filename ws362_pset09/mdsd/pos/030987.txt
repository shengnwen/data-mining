A small book on a large subject--But the shorter length makes it more likely to be read. The book has a series of chapters on the expected topics, like dealing with hiring, firing, and the personnel system. It is a worthwhile book, but doesn't have anything startlingly new or original.  Still one of the few books to treat this subject from a practioner's view  rather than an academic one. If the subject interests you, I'd suggest  reading Haass's &quot;The Power to Persuade&quot; in addition to (not  instead of) this book
