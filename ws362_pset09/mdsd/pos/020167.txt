I purchased this book mostly to help date vintage fabrics from the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's and 1960's.  I love the spiral binding.  The swatch examples are awesome.  The notes on color and styles are helpful.  I do feel, however, that lumping 1930 through 1960 photos together with no notes does not really help to date the fabric accurately enough.
