Wells's classic is still a useful book. It is most out of date on the early history and archeology, which has changed substantially in recent years. One only needs to look at the great volume by Jacquetta Hawkes and Sir Leonard Wooley, Prehistory and the Beginnings of Civilization, which covers the period from the end of the Calcolithic (about 40,000 years ago) down to the founding of the earliest towns (about 10,000 years ago), to see how much that has changed since their volume was published in the early 60s. But it shows Wells's range and depth of intellect, and it's interesting to note that Wells was considered the universal intellect of his day, and before people said "As smart as Einstein," they said, "As smart as H.G. Wells." The section on Alexander the Great I found one of the best. As a serious work of pedagogy intended for the intelligent layman, it presaged by decades later similar works. But although much of the history is still valid, today the book will be of most interest to Wells fans and scholars, though, rather than as an "Outline of History.
