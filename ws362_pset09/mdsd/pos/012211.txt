Having tweaked the nose of the church in his lifetime, Thomas Paine was corpse non grata at the cemetery gates when he died.  So his remains floated around for a hundred years, passing through the hands of a motley assortment of radicals, freethinkers, and nutcases.  Collins' delicious wit brings this bizarre  tale vividly to life.  It's not your usual sort of history, and that's what makes it so enjoyable.  Highly recommended.
