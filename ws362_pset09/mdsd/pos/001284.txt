I have all three of Giada's books, and I must say that she never fails to deliver.  This particular book is oraganized so well, that all I have to do is go to a section for what I am looking for that evening.  Not only does she provide great new recipes, she also has the best organized modern cookbook I have ever seen.  I also like the fact that she has various levels of dishes.  Her first book had recipes that were too "basic" in flavor for my tastes.  Here, she adds bold recipes like her beef short ribs.  In addition, hands down, Giada makes the best baked pastas, but she also has new makeovers for old dishes that brings pasta to the present, with a hint of nostalgia. Everytime I cook a dish from her cookbooks, I get a big smile from my husband, who looks forward to our evening dinners.
