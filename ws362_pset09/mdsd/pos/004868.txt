In my opinion Veritatis Splendor is the finest of Pope John Paul's encyclicals.  It is the best in terms of theological content as well as its ability to enrich one spiritually.  This document addresses head on many of the abuses found in today's Catholic universities and seminaries; abuses ranging from a failure to recognize the Magisterium of Christ's Church to the preponderance of such philosophical schools as proportionalism, relativism, and pragmatism which tend to deny the existence of absolute norms and therefore lead to eventually to lawlessness.
	It is the law that the Holy Father sets forth as the means of fulfilling the Christian faith.  The natural law is the expression of the Divine Law within creation and can be known by men through right reason.  The law, unable to be fulfilled by man without God's grace, is now capable of being fulfilled through the power of the Holy Spirit unleashed through the Gospel and made available to us through the sacraments.  The Holy Father eloquently expresses how it is through living out the law, even in extremely difficult circumstances that the Christian manifests Christ's presence and power in the world today and proclaims His Kingdom most effectively.
	Finally, the Holy Father firmly confirms the Church's constant teaching that there exist negative moral norms that can never be broken even with the intention of attaining some contingent good.  For example, one may never rob in order to feed the poor.  Yet Christ's mercy is ever present to forgive and strengthen anew those who fail to live the law and turn to Him for help.
	Reading this encyclical made me want to live the law, to seek virtue, to know the power of Christ at work in me.  Besides being an excellent work of moral theology and Magisterial teaching, it is above all in my estimation an uplifting spiritual treatise.
