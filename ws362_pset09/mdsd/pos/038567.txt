This is not a Hollywood confession, it is not a self serving ego trip, it  is solid autobiography. Frank Capra made it by himself, he endured poverty,  humiliation, and disappointment. He had brains, artistic sensitivity, and a  boundless store of energy.  As the son of immigrants he was given nothing  except a work ethic.        He worked his way through Cal Tech and got an  engineering degree. With little job opportunity after graduation, he bummed  it for a while over the southwest. Then he landed a job writing gags for  Mack Sennett.  He grew from there by writing screenplay. Capra was at his  creative best when portraying realistic themes. The next step was  directing, where he carried his realism to the top.      Early in his  career, Capra saw the Academy Award as the sign of artistic excellence,and  set out to win one. He poured every ounce of his creative energies into his  films. On several occasions he knew he deserved an Oscar, only to be  disappointed again. Then he made it with &quot;It Happened One Night.&quot;  Yet to Capra everything went wrong in making the movie: the wrong leading  man, the rewrites, the arguments, the mistakes, the frustrations, the last  minute changes. Your first Oscar is  your toughest. After that Oscars came  naturally to Capra, and he won a bundle of them. Now his &quot;name was  above the movie title&quot; on the marquee. The book chronicles the making  of his best films, each more interesting than the last.     But Capra was  more than Holloywood. He stood for artistic integrity and decency. He was  generous and willing to help others; he also had his ememies, and was large  of ego. He gave unsparingly of himself during WWII as the officer in charge  of making Allied training and propaganda films. There's more about this  man, much more. Its worth every moment of your reading time.      Next  Christmas, when they run &quot;Its A Wonderful Life&quot; on TV again, I  guarantee you will appreciate the film more than ever. I would recommend  this book to film buffs, and lovers of history or biography
