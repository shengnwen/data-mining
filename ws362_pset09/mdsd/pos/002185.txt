The book unfolds more as a story rather than an autobiography. Somewhere down the line, the reader forgets that (s)he is reading about the early life of one of the greatest contemporary writers - Gabriel Garcia Marquez. 

As with any other GGM book, it is slightly slow to start with, but then when one passes through the labyrinthe of words which GGM lays out for the reader, one realizes that without realizing it, the book has become an addiction for the reader and it just cannot be put down. One sometimes has to read the sentences again and again to be able to appreciate the penmanship of the writer ("This atavistic prejudice, whose embers still smolder, has turned us into a vast community of unmarried women and men with flies unzipped and numerous children born out of wedlock").

A GGM fan will recognize that many incidents in his books have been inspired from his real-life experiences - the messages sent by GGMs father to his mother during their courtship days using the help of a succession of telegraphic operators have inspired the episode of messages sent by Florentino Ariza to his wandering sweetheart Fermina Daza in "Love in the time of Cholera". 

At times one wonders at the extremely detailed descriptions GGM gives of his childhood and his mlange of uncles, aunts and fellow writers-to-be. While reading the book, I realized that either my childhood was extremely uneventful or that I have an extremely poor memory. But then I am not GGM !!!!
