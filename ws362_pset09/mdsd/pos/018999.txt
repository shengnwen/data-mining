Presents stories from the entire history of space opera (although heavily biased toward more recent stories), with scholarly comments on each entry and a long, informative introduction.  A good selection of enjoyable stories from some of the major writers of the form (although Vernor Vinge is inexplicably absent).  The copyediting is uneven in spots, with missing or misspelled words.
