Its got a lot of good information, but its way too wordy. Its really about a 40 page book "crammed" into 200 pages. 

Her points are well taken. When I worked in the financial planning industry I felt like a priest listening to confessions; but, priests only hear about impure thoughts, yada yada, you get to hear the good stuff: what do people really make and quickly realize how many folks are total "posers." 

Hope she writes another one, just chop out the wordiness and give more examples with more data of income, debt load, %debt to equity ratios, etc.
