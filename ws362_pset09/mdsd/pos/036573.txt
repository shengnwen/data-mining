The second in the Bath and Body Series can be read independently and enjoyed on its own but fits great in the series.  Relationships developed in the first book evolve naturally and new characters appear to add intrigue and romance.  

The plot centers around corporate espionage in the beauty industry.  Venus Envy, the spa owned and operated by the main character Persia and her aunt Florence, is struggling to make ends meet and being outdone by a new player in town - Bebe.  

The first part of the book is a little slow for readers who've read the first book.  The final showdown between Bebe and Persia is, however, intriguing and entertaining.  Overall the book is a good second in the series and leaves you anxious for the next book
