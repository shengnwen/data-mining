Paco's Story is about young Paco Sullivan.  Sole survivor of his unit's ambush, he has returned to the States to look for work.  Left with painful injuries that require powerful painkillers every day, Paco encounters both curiousity and discrimination from the locals in the small town he ends up in.  

Paco's story is written with graphic, lyrical language that brings his horrific war memories, and his trying to fit in as a veteran of a war that nobody really understood, to life.  Heinemann writes in an unusual, dream-like way that just draws the reader in, until they feel like they are feeling what Paco feels.  He writes of Paco's seemingly mundane experiences and transforms them into something cathartic.   A must read for anyone interested in Nam
