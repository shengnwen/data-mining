While I usually love the quirky heroines in JAK's novels, I have to agree with another reviewer that Elly acted like a spoiled brat at the beginning of the book and I too didn't like that she dumped orange juice on the hero. She didn't seem like JAK's usual heroines. Unlike the other reviewer however, I did think she improved as the book went along. 

I loved Cooper Boone. He was enigmatic and sexy, as are most of her heroes, but he had more funny lines than others I've read. That set him apart for me. I especially loved his relationship with Rose.

Rose was the true star of this story. She was even better than Fuzz. I loved how she kept taking Elly's bracelets and wearing them like a collar. That dust bunny had definite personality.

Some people have commented that JAK's books are formulaic. I say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's a formula that works for her
