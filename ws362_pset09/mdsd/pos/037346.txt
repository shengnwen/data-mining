Stevenson is best known today as a writer of juvenile fiction.  This doesn't do justice to his skills as a writer of historical fiction or his ability to explore psychological and moral issues.  Master of Ballantrae is one of his best works.  Set in 18th century Scotland, it is an exploration of the nature and relationship between good and evil.  In many ways, this is a parallel book to Jekyll and Hyde.  In Master, the different aspects of human moral behavior are explored in conflict and relationship of 2 brothers, one charismatic and amoral, the other, stolid and virtuous.  This is primarily a psychological novel of family tragedy brought about by the characters of the 2 bothers in a conflict ignited by the Jacobite uprising of 1745.  Stevenson does an excellent job of handling the characters and plot.  As with his other work, there is a nice depiction of 18th century Scotland.  This is not a great work, but it is very good
