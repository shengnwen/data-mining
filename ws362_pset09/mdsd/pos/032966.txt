Too many companies have employees that are "retired on the job", simply going through the motions and too listless to find a job they are more suitable for. These employees have disengaged their mind from their work. There is a solution and Terri has been showing companies how to engage their employees long before the concept became in vogue. Drawing on solid research and numerous real life examples from top companies, I Quit But Forgot to Tell You clearly and intelligently points out the how and why employees become disconnected from their job and the symptoms to be alert for. What makes this book so valuable is that it provides a blueprint for reversing the tide of disengagement and hiring and nurturing people so that they truly live your brand. The solutions make sense. I am recommending this book to all my clients.
