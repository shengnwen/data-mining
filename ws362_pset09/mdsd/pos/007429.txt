In comparison to the other casebooks I've been forced to read this year as a 1L, this casebook is probably the best written.  Instead of just placing emphasis on the cases and the rules to glean from them, it also highlights key principles and strategies to use as a lawyer in the future(termed lawyering by the authors).  I must admit that taking Nathan Crystal's contract class obviously helps in the understanding of the book, but it's a good regardless
