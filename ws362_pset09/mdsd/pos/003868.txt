This is a good work for a general piece on hiking.  It covers a lot of topics such as: gear, clothing, planning, food/water, some simple do's and don'ts, etc...  However it quickly covers these topics seeming to leave out the indepth discussions one would expect on such things as gear, packing and other things.
Don't get me wrong, it is a good book.  It just isn't a very detailed book.  Everything in it seems to only exist as just a few paragraphs.  Where as you could fill up a whole chapter on just choosing the right day pack this book contains about two pages on the subject.
So it is a good quick read for those interested but if you are really planning to spend some time out on the trail you should pick up a book actually on backpacking.
