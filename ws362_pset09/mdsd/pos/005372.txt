The Van Gogh Café, by Cynitha Rylant is a wonderful story. It is full of magical stories that fill every chapter. This book deserves five stars. Many small problems occur, such as, thousands of seagulls land on the roof top of the café. Also there is a blizzard and many small children on a bus crash, but the café helps them to get better. I would recommend this book to fourth graders and up because young children may not understand this story.
