For me this was the most enjoyable of the Enron books.  What struck another reviewer as a negative -- how in the dark the reporters were about what they were writings about -- struck me as well, for a different reason, namely, how worrisome it is that things that have such a gigantic effect on the market's perception of the company can be so hard to find out about. And, as that reviewer pointed out, it highlights how little the media who write about the "business world" really know about the details. (Of course, anyone who has ever read a news story about a company they work for is aware of this).  
I enjoyed following the reporters' quest to find things out - the "reporter as information hero" approach. It reminded me of "All the President's Men" and the days when I respected the press as the natural adversaries of bovernment / big business, which is always stonewalling.  I also found the book to be much more intelligently written than many of the other books on the subject.  I also agree with the reviewer who would have liked to see more discussion of What it All Means, although it's easy to see why the authors would have regarded that subject as something no one is interested in
