I've never read poetry this honest, this heart-wrenching, this intense, this passionate, this realistic, this humorous, this painful... I could go on for ages, but it would turn into drooling dribble.  Olds is amazingly talented.  Her work is graphic, as real life is, and not to be taken lightly.  Buy it, commit to reading it, appreciate her world view
