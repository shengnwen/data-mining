I do agree that the fuzzy fotos could have been substituted with some of the others from the 32,000 other pictures gleaned from Project Apollo...But I'm not complaining. I just picked this book up for the tidy sum of $6.98 from the "bargain books" rack at Barnes and Noble. Definitely would have let it pass at $50.00 though
