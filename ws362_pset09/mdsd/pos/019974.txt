I have spent the last few weeks reading this book.  On one hand the book is easy to read and presents a lot of good material.  But it really reflects mainly what I learned in my undergraduate curriculum.  I did not see a lot of new material, but I have also met many who did not practice these things.  The best thing about the book is the checklists.  They are great starting points for making your own checklists and put together a lot of things that are easy to overlook in the moment of creation
