An old and new serial killing case in New York City show amazingly similar characteristics. The eccentric, yet charismatic Special Agent Pendergast asks Dr. Nora Kelly from the New York Museum of Natural History for help to solve this mystery which proves to be more mind-boggling than any of them would have imagined possible.

"The Cabinet Of Curiosities" by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child has everything an excellent mystery needs - first of all, a unique and captivating mystery, secondly, a plot with an even flow, and, finally and maybe most important of all, a set of endearing characters to whom the reader can easily relate. I was immediately drawn into the story, enjoying the easy-going style of writing. It's amazing that you don't notice a difference in the parts which Preston or Child wrote. All in all, it's an engrossing read which will appeal to mystery lovers.
