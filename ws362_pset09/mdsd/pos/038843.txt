Walking With the Wise first caught my attention when I noticed all the famous people in the book.  After picking it up and starting to read about them and their lives, I noticed that all of these people had gone through many trials in order to be successful and eventually lead a great life.  As I read through it, a light started to go on inside of me. It occurred to me that I to could lead a life of prosperity any time I wanted.  It was always available...I just needed to accept the gift.  This book really changed my life.  The individuals who write their stories, advice or words of wisdom...do it in such a way that I could easily relate with.  When you look at some of these mentors or millionaires from far off, they appear to be celebrities and their lifestyle unattainable.  When you read their stories, it inspires and encourages you to move out and live your dream.  I thank the author who gathered all the people together in this book.  Linda Forsythe has really made a difference for good in the lives of many by bringing all of these fantastic people together in one place.  You go girl
