Most dog encyclopedias or &quot;pick the best breed for you&quot; books are just photo albums with breed descriptions straight out of the  AKC info snippets. They tend to have very little practical info on breeds or their quirks. I dont know where the information came from for this book, but breed after breed I found it right on the money. Having worked as a veterinary kennelworker for 3 years and in a groomers shop for 2 I have had experience with most common breeds and this is THE book I hand out whenever people ask &quot;What should I get?&quot;.  I really had to laugh at gems in there like &quot;Shih tzu, special abilities: Shadow&quot;  or &quot;Bearded collie, protection: may bark.. if they think burglar has come to play  with them&quot;. Spot on! :
