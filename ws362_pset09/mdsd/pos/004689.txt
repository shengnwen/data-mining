The students at my (elementary) school love Max Lucado's books and this is one of their favorites.  It is a message that is told over and over again - everyone is different, everyone is special.  But Mr. Lucado tells this story in a new way, simply and beautifully.  As a teacher, I can't recommend it enough.  As an adult, I appreciate the message.  As a kid who doesn't want to grow up, I just love the story and characters
