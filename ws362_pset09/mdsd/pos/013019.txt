I have all 3 Vol. of Julian Sprung's The Reef Aquarium.  I find a wealth of information and great pictures, but it's hard to read, too much technical details that can make your head spin. I don't think the information in the books simplify things for the hobbiest, instead it compicates everything.  If you are new to the reef hobby this book is not for you, if you've been a successful hobbiest and want to learn even more, this is your book
