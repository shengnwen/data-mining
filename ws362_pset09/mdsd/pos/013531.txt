Though very well written and engrossing, "Africa Zero" may be confusing to someone who has never read Neal Asher before. It's beginning (and end) is abrupt and overwhelming and the action is brutal and fast moving- the reader will be playing catch-up until half-way through the first story. If you know Asher's work, this is probably what you enjoy most about it but if you've never read anything by him you will probably be a bit confused. However, Asher (as usual) excells at his streamlined method of storytelling to throw the reader into the middle of the story and engross them, even if it's at a forced-march. Gory at times but also laugh-out-loud funny and full of great visuals, "Africa Zero" is not Asher's best work but is definitely one that reinforces Asher's stand-out status among modern sci-fi writers
