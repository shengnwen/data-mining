This book in my opinion was very interesting. I found it easy to read, understandable, and also had a sense of humor. It kept me reading and was a great page-turner. I couldn't put it down! It kept me on the edge of my seat with great imagery and description. The author has a brilliant sense of style and this is another good book for his collection. The book is a little short and I thought that the plot was a little far out there, but if you have a good imagination and patience, you'll find this exhilarating book can be one of your favorites.
