I enjoy reading this book because it was interesting how the kids wanted to take the shortcut home, even toght ther knew it was not safe. The story reminded me of how sometimes when im doing homework i wanted to get it done even toght i knoe sometimes its not ryte. I learn from this book that trying your best on everything u do is the right way to do something
