This is overall a very concise and to-the-point, no hassle type of book that teaches you little bits and pieces of developing yourself as a charismatic person as well as presenting yourself in front of others.
It does not giantly overwhelm you with too much information and have some very unique ideas that are easy and fun to read.  Most of them are little tricks here and there, for example, how to present better in front of others, how read other's feelings by looking at their facial expressions, and how to develop your character, by flaunting your unique personality.
I would say this book is like little book of tricks that touches upon various aspects lightly; for influence, charisma, and showmanship.

If you are looking for a book to develop yourself as a more memorable character, without a 3000 page textbook read, check this one out.
