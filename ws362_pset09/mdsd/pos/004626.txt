I read the reviews, bought the book and the other book about Abs and started my 6-week journey to a better looking body.  After week one, I couldn't believe the difference.  I am now in week 6 and I love this workout.  My clothes fit so much better, I've only lost 2 lbs (but then I don't need to lose weight, just gain muscle) and I have a ton of energy.  I love eating so 5 meals a day (SENSIBLE MEALS!!) was not a problem for me.  You do indeed have to plan ahead, none of this on-the-fly preparation, but it is truly worth it.  You must stick to the plan completely for it to work.  Really read the exercise explanations about the technique as those make a world of difference and also, focus on the muscle on which you are working when performing your specific exercise.  That too makes a world of difference!!  Buy the books and enjoy!!
