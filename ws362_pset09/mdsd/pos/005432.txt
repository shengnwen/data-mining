At last! A real biography of arguably the best lyricist in popular music. Sadly for me it is a&quot;warts and all&quot; book. I admire him so much that I felt hurt to see how human he was. After some time passed, I realized those &quot;warts&quot; were probably responsible for the quality of his later masterpieces. I am now listening &quot; I Remember You &quot; and &quot;One for My Baby&quot; and &quot;This Time the Dream's on Me&quot; with much more insight. Thanks Mr. Furia
