Dickens was a genius, and this work, written when he was in his early 20s, exemplifies that fact. The plot is a bit cliched, and deus ex machinae are everywhere, but, good Lord, the characterizations (and the accompanying names) are superb. The wry insights, the gentle cynicism, the not-so-gentle look at the poorhouses, the indelible imagery, the seamless shifts from comedy to tragedy and back again, all make for an unforgettable book--no matter how many forgettable film adaptations have been made. A joy to read.
