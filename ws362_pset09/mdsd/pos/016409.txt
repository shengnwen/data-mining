The French Revolution remains one of the crucial events of modern European and world history. The revolution stands as an event that hailed the fall of feudalism and marked the triumph of the common person over the aristocracy. In truth, reality is much more complex than that presented in a common textbook. The French revolution has been an object of praise as much as it has been the focus of heated debate. While the old regime may have fallen "in a night", the revolution was a product of a gradual resentment which went far beyond an outburst of revolutionary fervor. In The Old Regime and the French Revolution Alexis de Tocqueville allows us a definitive glimpse at the circumstances that lead to revolt. In Tocqueville's mind there was never an event in which "stemming from factors so far back in the past, (was) so inevitable yet (so) completely unforeseen."  In this less read work, he takes on the origins of the French Revolution and the peculiar French form of democracy it brought, in stark contrast to his portrayal in Democracy in America.  The Old Regime and the French Revolution is deserving of its status as a classic for the remarkable insight it provides. While Tocqueville's work is a classic, it draws upon the work and thought of other scholars and it is revisionist in the way it changes the way the French revolution is discussed. Along with more widely accepted views on the revolution, which is important in marking it a classic) Tocqueville describes history in a way that allows the reader to place the revolution in a global perspective, while dissecting it enough to understand its intricacies
