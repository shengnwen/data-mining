Ever since reading about the unfortunate event that put Timothy Treadwell and his companion on the "public map in a major way" there seemed to be more questions than answers in his life's story as it came to light. I actually thought he was Australian... 

Werner Herzog's stitchwork of Timothy's bear movies allowed us a very rare and wonderful glimpse into an incredible force in Timothy's life. But, the movie is only a doorway that invites anyone who is moved and inspired by it to step across the threshold and find out more about Timothy Treadwell. This book is a good next step into that world. It gives a little more insight into Timothy's own thoughts and covers a number of years worth of summers with his favorite bears. It has the unmistaken light tone of Timothy's reasoning and his adventurous nature. He describes a variety of encounters and observations, all with his youthful glee. In the literary sense there may be a lot wrong with this book, but if you liked the movie you will probably enjoy it, and that is what counts.

While it still leaves a lot of questions about Timmy unanswered, it is an addition to his bear movies, and has a few self-described insights into his own personality. One can argue how much negative impact Timothy's presence had on the bears, and if you are looking for that debate this book may not be for you. To get to hear some other sides of Timothy's character and life, you'll have to read some of the other books that are available on this subject. Here, reading this book, you get to be with Timothy for a while longer, and for me it was hard to put down.
