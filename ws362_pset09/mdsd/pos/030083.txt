Excellent book! I have only recently heard about Cortisol and the roll it plays in weight gain, and Talbott does a good job of explaining how it works. I feel as though he were writing about me. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I felt he could have explained more about eating on the plan itself, instead of just giving an example for one day of meals
