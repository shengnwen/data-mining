We love this book in our house.  It teaches what happens when a home runs amuck with bad manners. Shoving, name calling, blaming, throwing food, you name it, the bears have it and mama is tired of it.  So, she puts together the bear family manners plan and if they forget them, then they have certain chores they have to do as reminders.  Now, I agree with the other reviewer that chores as a punishment isn't exactly the best approach, but when they're chores that normally are not pleasant (such as cleaning up after an animal's waste) and have to be divided equally, then I can see the punishment factor coming into play there as being appropriate.  I've emptied cat boxes most of my life and I still don't enjoy doing it so I can see that as being an effective punishment for bad manners.  

Anyway, that said, the cubs go way overboard in being nice to one another.  So much so that it's sickening and their goal is to have mama cancel the whole thing and let them go back to being ridiculous.  However, mama doesn't go back and they learn to enjoy each other and treat each other with respect.  Papa, however, learns the lesson the hard way and does many chores.  But, when he runs into another car and a very angry bear gets out, he remembers his manners and a potentially ugly situation was avoided just by using good manners.

This book has been read quite a bit in our house and has had a wonderful effect.  I sincerely highly recommend it
