It was already late when I started to read. My wife and kids were asleep, the house was quiet. I'd been sick that day and was tired, but strangely alert; I hoped a little light reading would put me in a drowse and let me get some much-needed rest. So I picked the top book off one of several to-read piles strategically located around the house and settled in for a quick couple of pages.

My mistake. The next book on the stack was "The Seven Whistlers" by actress Amber Benson (best known as Tara on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") and author Christopher Golden. I was up 'til 6, when I finished the story.

Fortunately for my health and well-being, it's a short novel, only 143 pages. For all its brevity, it is powerful, beautifully conceived and developed, and utterly riveting. Benson and Golden have created a new mythology that rings true.
