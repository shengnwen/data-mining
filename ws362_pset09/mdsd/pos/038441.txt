"The Circle" was recommended to me by a colleauge just a few short weeks ago and I must say it has changed my life in a way I would not have thought possible. It has changed the way I look at my job, my customers, people in other service industries and life in general. I firmly believe that you would be hard pressed to not find some sort of nugget in this book that would make each and every one of you say "WOW!!! I never thought of this like that!?!?!" It is an awesome guide to business and to life, the only warning I have is to be careful if you decide to pick it up because it holds the power to forever change the way you do business or live life and if you aren't ready for the changes that will come they could be mindboggling. To all who choose to grab this and embrace it - I wish you Good Luck and hope it affects you in the same ways it has me
