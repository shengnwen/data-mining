After reading the reviews prior to listening to the CD book, I was pleasurably surprised about how much I liked it (goes to show that what is no good to one person may not be the same for another!).

I thought the characters were good and fairly realistic... both Grace and Jake had one thing in mind above all else and that was Frankie (as I'm sure any parent would if their kid had a big bounty on thier head.) I liked Grace and Jake as a couple - felt they went well together and admired the sacrafices they made in order to protect their daughter. I also love horses so I enjoyed that the mystical side of the book involved them.
