When I was in high school in 1960 the United States launched the first Discoverer satelite was launched. It was, of course, launched for purely peaceful, scientific purposes. 

This book talks about the CORONA project which had the public cover name 'Discoverer.' 

Years later I was selling high-tech equipment to the Government. The buyers were organizations with initials like N-PIC and NRO. Even the initials were secret, and the names National Photographic Interpretation Center and National Reconnaissance Office were so far into the 'black' that they weren't even mentioned. 

This book says that the information in it has been cleared for release by these very organizations. 

Once in a meeting someone mentioned 'Keyhole.' I said, "What." He shut up really quickly. 

Most of this book consists of pages that were marked "TOP SECRET - TALENT - KEYHOLE." TALENT is imagery. KEYHOLE is the camera system (designed by Polaroid). 

I later was talking to an Air Force pilot who had been transferred to Hawaii. when he got there he asked another officer what the deal was. He was told, "Oh, we fly out to a spot in the pacific and we use a hook system on the plane to catch a parachute out of the air that is lowering a capsule that has been ejected from a satellite up in space." What a wise ass, he thought until he found out that that was what they were really doing. 

The CORONA images are now available for anyone to use. But now their biggest utility is to examine what has happened over the forty five years since they were taken. 

This book is the first released on CORONA, it consists of the original reports written at the time, declassified but with certain parts blacked out. It's the original scoop
