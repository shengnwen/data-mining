In Safe Trip to Eden, the author introduces an interesting concept called Green Patriotism, which is the call to Americans to protect our environment because it will ultimately strengthen our national security.  He takes the readers on a trip across America and beyond (to the rainforest in Costa Rica, the San Juan Islands, the Adirondacks, etc.) and each place we learn something new about our  current environmental state of affairs - the problems, what is being done by environmentalists to correct them, and how we can make choices in our own lives to support the solutions.  

The author emphasizes our power as consumers in a capitalistic culture -that each of our purchase decisions is like casting a vote.  He also makes the point that environmentalism is not a partisan issue.  While it has been associated with liberals, he gives a history of Republicans and environmentalism in chapter 9.

The book is extremely comprehensive in that it discusses the presence of petrochemical toxins in food and home products, the evolving green car industry, a facinating Pentagon risk assessment report on global warming, natural medicine, the treatment of livestock, negative effects of underpricing in the marketplace, how to maintain a sustainable forest, and much more. 

Overall, it's a facinating, empowing and very educating read.  I highly recommend it!
