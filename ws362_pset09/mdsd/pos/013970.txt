This is my second Roth book, the first being The Plot Against America.  After reading other reviews I hope to read some of his older stuff.

The nice thing about this book is that it is essentially it is a novella, which allows for considerable brevity, which Roth performs expertly, with a minimum of words and maximum of emotional punch.  It is an excellent portrayal of American life - how children of immigrants start in their ethnic neighborhoods and become, for better or for worse, "Americanized" and subject to the current national trends.  As such, this book indirectly is a commentary on twentieth century American life.  Nice approach as well, where Roth starts at the end and works forward.  Throw in a few thoughts on illness and mortality, and you have yourself some great fiction.  Bravo
