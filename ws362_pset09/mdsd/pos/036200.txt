It amazes me that Tess Gerritsen is able to write such awesome thrillers, time after time.  And yet she does, proving that she is, quite simply, at the top of her game--and at the top of the psychological thriller/mystery genre!

Many others have outlined the plot of THE MEPHISTO CLUB, so let me just say a few things:  this is a great storyline, original, and handled deftly.  The action-adventure is non-stop throughout the book, and although you know, basically from the beginning of the story, who the bad guy is, it doesn't stop the book from being interesting and intriguing.

I loved that Father Brophy and Dr. Maura Isles finally "got together," but I need this relationship to go beyond The Thornbirds!!  There has got to be a resolution to this plot line, and soon!

My only complaint with the story is Jane Rizzoli, who I actually love.  However, her hard-a**, morally superior attitude in this book ticked me off.  I want to see the softer side of Jane, the nurturing mother side, the love of Gabriel's life side--as well as the the tough-as-nails, ball-buster homicide detective.

Believe me, though,  THE MEPHISTO CLUB is another winner!
