Perhaps it's because I've read so many of Dr. Sowell's books and columns, but I'm beginning to see a lot overlap in what he writes.

1. He has talked about the role of navigable rivers in economic development several times before-- not least in his "Migrations and Culture" book among other places (columns).

2. The notion that the amount of "dead capital" that is sitting in places like Haiti and other third world countries that cannot be erected because of poorly functioning legal systems is not new either. This is something that was covered at great length in William Easterly's book "Misadventures in the Tropics" and (I believe) in "Wealth and Poverty of Nations" (David Landes). Both of them are great books. Of course, Dr. Sowell writes about them in an interesting and easy-to-understand way, but the book feels very much like a secondary source since I know exactly where these arguments come from

3. A lot of the data on differences in income between different ethnic groups was trotted out from older works (but updated), so one gets a strong sense of deja vu when reading this.

Overall, it's a good and very readable work. It is worth reading for people who never bother to fill in their ideas with specific case studies or case examples of what *actually happened* under certain circumstances.

His discussion of health care economics was also very interesting and made the whole book worth its purchase price. So, on the strength of that alone, I recommend the book
