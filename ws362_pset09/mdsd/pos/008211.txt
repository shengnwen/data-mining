This book is vital and interesting, even across the gulf of the 40-odd years since it was written. Steinbeck writes to us from the far side of the 60's "generation gap" and even the far side of post-World War II industrialization and urbanization. 

Steinbeck dislikes superhighways and cities, and is most comfortable on country roads and in rural areas. Steinbeck and his dog Charley fight bureaucracy, park rules, bad moods, and mistrust of strangers with free liquor, good old American hospitality, and wit. Along the way he encounters uncooperative Canadian border guards, quaint European migrant farm workers, his own politically polarized family, rich Texans, and other exemplars of the melting pot. 

The book's climax is Steinbeck's description of racial tension in the south over the integration of public schools. He describes a performance by the New Orleans "cheerleaders," a group of racist women who yelled obscenities at white children and their parents who escorted them as the children dared to attend grade school with the first black children allowed in.

Steinbeck pulls this off through his remarkably pleasant narrative voice. Reading this book is like spending time with your well-liked great uncle. You know he is basically nostalgic and prefers things the way they were rather than the way they are, but he stops short of being tiresome about it, and doesn't seem to blame you.

In writing about America, Steinbeck directly demonstrates some of the best things about the american character. He honestly reports the good and the bad, believes that people are basically good and striving to improve, and shows that honest, respectful relations between individuals can cure, or at least make tolerable, most of society's ills
