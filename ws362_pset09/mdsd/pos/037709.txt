    I read the second summer of the sisterhood by ann Brashares. This is a very good but for mature girls and youg teens. The original ideas keep you reading...

   This book is about 4 girls that have been best friends sience they were born.. 2 years ago they were all going sperate ways for the suumer for the very first time.And the day before they all leave they go shopping at a thrift store when carmen found a pair of pants and she went to try them on they fit her like no other, so she had the other girls try them on and they fit them all like really fit all the girls, and the girls were all different shapes and sizes... so the girls decided the pants were magic so they came up with a plan to send the pants back and forth over the summer....

The only thng i wasnt to excited about was how long the book was but im not a volinteer reader.... I would highly recomed this book to anyone loves to read and love friend ship stories.. 
I Would read this book again
