With the publication of &quot;Daemonomania&quot;,the third part of a  projected four part series,it is possible to renavigate the strange ocean  of images and themes that is &quot;Aegypt&quot; (the first in the  sequence). The coherence of the interpenetrating mosiac of narratives  becomes vivid with careful rereading. Crowley's intent is nothing less than  a hermetic reenchanting of the modern world, in which the givens of  consensual reality are called into question by a great &quot;what  if?&quot;. What if the old magics of the preScientific Age had actually  worked due to our conscious assent...would the forces set in motion by  Renaissance mages such as John Dee still reverberate in the present, in  rural upstate New York ? Do we then have choices between  &quot;realities&quot;,both personal and public , that influence the way the  world is and will be ? &quot;Aegypt&quot; begins Crowley's examination of  the deep implications of this possibility.With deft skill he draws the  reader into a familiar yet arcane World in which symbol and substance fuse  together.The impact is visceral and engrossing. The historian Pierce  Moffett ,presented with the same existential dilemma as the antihero in  Sartre's &quot;Nausea&quot;, is impelled to construct or ,perhaps,  rediscover the World.Akin to an allegorical tableaux of the High  Renaissance, &quot;Aegypt&quot; has the capacity to amaze and educate,  enrich and renew. Taken together, the series may eventually redefine Magic  Realism in the same way that &quot;Little,Big&quot; by Crowley redefined  (Le Guin's term) Fantasy. A casket of rare wonders
