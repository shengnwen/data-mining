This book successfully captures the horrific chaos that is combat in a series of epic battles which shaped the fate of the world. Details about everything from small arms to anti-tank mines are throughout the text, making it almost like a military hardware manual. These details are merely a background for what is actually a story about a man who answers the call of duty for his country, and his struggle to survive against impossible odds. What makes the story interresting is that this is about a German soldier. It's like watching a mirror image of most WW2 movies, which are typically about allied soldiers
