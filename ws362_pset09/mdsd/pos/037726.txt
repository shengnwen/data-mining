Having spent 300 bucks on the original limited edition almost 20-25 years ago, this has been a series near and dear to my heart. It's probably some of my favorite King work next to The Dead Zone and The Stand; the charatcers are crystal clear even if many things in the book are not.Only upon rereading it again after finishing the 7th book in the series do many things make sense. I'm not saying it's a hard book to follow-it's certainly not, and at under 300 pages or so, it's a quick read, but it's lasting impressions have stuck with me for all this time. While some of the following in the series stumble along the way (song of susannah) it's still the most moving on many levels. I even have the magazine the first few chappters were originally published in, and while I understand him wanting to clean it up somewhat in the recent replrint, I'll go back to the original every time. Needless to say highly recommended from me
