In this involving and complicated story, David Baldacci covers everything from drug dealing, to cults, to the FBI, to pyschoanalyis and hypnotism.  There's also a horse farm and pornography thrown in for good measure!  The main plot deals with the character of Web London, the sole survivor of a botched mission by HRT (Hostage Rescue Team), a part of the FBI; as he and his companions are en route to tackle a drug lord, London suddenly collapses, unable to continue, as if paralyzed.  He then is forced to witness his colleagues' massacre as they are shot by remote control weaponry as they enter an urban courtyard.  London's determination to discover what happened to him and clear his name makes up the bulk of the novel.  In his journey, he is forced to confront childhood abuse, and the possible abuse of his psychiatrist.  Baldacci tells the story from several points of view, and should be credited with creating complex and compelling characters who are both heroic and flawed.  On the good side, this helps when the plot becomes increasingly complicated; on the potentially bad side, the characters are, not surprisingly, unhappy with their lives, and there's not a `happy' ending for most of them.  The pain gets a little much at times, even though the `good' guys win at the end. The end is abrupt, and leaves you wondering if you missed something. Worth reading, just concentrate on the plot, or it will get away from you
