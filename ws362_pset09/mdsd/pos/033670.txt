This book was an easy read, but a sad one. The plight of the Chechen people is virtually unknown in the U.S. The author points out that Putin, Kofi Annan, and Bush do not or cannot do anything to stop the violence and illegal behavior in Chechnya. Politkovskaya writes her book in a series of short stories that recount the conditions in Chechnya.  She personally witnessed some illegal activities, and documents others from victims. The story is riveting, I read the 224 pages in a 12 hour period, but it is not an action or adventure story, only a depressing one
