I would recommend reading this book, although not before reading Stanislavski's trilogy.

This book contains much useful advice, but is confusing in places. Meisner is much easier to learn with a teacher, and some of the techniques and exercises described in the book are difficult or impossible to practice on your own.

In spite of this, I would still recommend this book as an introduction to the Meisner technique, which I think that all actors should be familiar with
