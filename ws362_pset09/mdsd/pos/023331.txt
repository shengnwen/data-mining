Garth Ennis, Preacher: Proud Americans (DC Comics, 1997)

Garth Ennis' iconoclastic series rolls on here, providing us with a bit of background and developing the storyline. We get information about Jesse's father's time in Vietnam, Cassidy's transformation, and the Grail. 

There's really not much to say about Ennis' incomparable series I haven't said in other reviews. This is great stuff. Get it. Preferably in order, but just get it. ***
