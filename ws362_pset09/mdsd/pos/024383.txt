     Part of the continuing success in the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" series is the ability of the editors to reap the fertile field of talented, young writers.  Debbie Roppolo's "Some Snowballs Don't Melt" is a beautifully told story about the bond between a working man and his working dog.  Sad, yet uplifting, the story demonstrates how the relationship between man and animal can transcend mortality.  Ms. Ropollo brings the tale of her father and his German Shepherd to life with intimate and exquisite details.  One can easily see stories like this being transformed into family movies, the type not often seen in this day and age.
