If you are a fan of Dragonlance, then you will more than likely enjoy this book. Fans of the Chronicles and the Legends will certainly enjoy the added stories that Weis and Hickman are giving us. This book is especially good if you're a fan of Flint.

There is some poor editing in the book, more than normal I'd say. Also, if you haven't read any Dragonlance books yet, don't read this one, as you'll just be confused--there is little to no explanation given for the current events. Start with "Dragons of Autumn Twilight" and go from there. 

On the whole, I loved every minute of it
