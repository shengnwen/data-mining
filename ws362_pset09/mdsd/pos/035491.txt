I have to say that I wasn't sure what to think of this book, especially since I'm not a big fan of mystery/detective books, but I read Ian's first book in the series and enjoyed so I thought I'd see if he could keep my interest on the second......and boy did he!!!!  It still boggles my mind how Ian writes a 210 page book with so many twist and turns and yet it never feels like he has to rush to finish the story.  I guess what I'm saying is that this book flows extremely well for having so much going on and yet it only takes him 210 pages to wrap up the story!  Inspector Rebus continues to grow as the main character in this book and he has a great mix of "hard edge attitude", the ability to "turn on the charm", and yet still be human and have "weak" moments as well.  It also helps that Ian has added some side characters from the police force to help readers undertsand how John Rebus interacts with his fellow co-workers (on and off the job).  If you are new to this series, get the first book (Knots and Crosses) then get this book.  However, you will be fine buying this book even if you didn't read the first one.  Either way, you won't regret it.....I sure didn't.
