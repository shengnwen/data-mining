   Have you ever read a story with a mysterious "lunatic", a missing mother, and mysterious notes appearing out of nowhere?  That's what happens in the book, Walk Two Moons.  In this book, there are two stories being told at the same time.  Salamanca Hiddle, also called Sal, is telling two stories while in a car trip with her grandparents.  The story with the lunatic is the story of Phoebe Winterbottom. Sal is telling this story to her grandparents to entertain them on their drive to visit Sal's mother.  Sal hopes that she will reach her mother's home by her birthday.  Will Sal be there in time?  Who is this lunatic?
    I liked this book because once one story got boring the other would be interesting.  I was very eager to read what would happen.   I could actually feel how Sal probably would have felt if she were real.  The author describes the places that Sal goes to so well that I could feel that I was actually there.  I sometimes questioned if the author actually went to those places.    
     I would recommend this book to people who just want to sit down and read on a boring day.  Walk Two Moons is a book for both boys and girls.  This book would definitely brighten up your day with its interesting story
