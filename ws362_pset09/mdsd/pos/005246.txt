This little volume takes about two hours or so to get through and is well worth the time if you've any interest in mechanical history.  It starts with the story of how its author set about deciding what is the "best" tool developed during the millennium just ended.  His object was to write an essay on the topic for the New York Times.  On his wife's suggestion he settled on the screwdriver and then scoured museums and libraries for its provenance.  The book, however, is not primarily about screwdrivers, but about this research and ultimately about the screw itself, which after all gave rise to the screwdriver, and about some of the machinery such helical devices enable.   It is the author's feeling that the screw represented a leap of inspiration rather than a logical development based on previous devices.  It may be that using screws to fasten objects together was a genius move, but in fact shafts with helical threads were earlier used in various machines where considerable pressure needed to be generated, such as oil and wine presses and their offspring.
