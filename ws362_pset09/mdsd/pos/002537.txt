This book is a tour de force, perhaps the best spy novel I ever read, despite a few inaccuracies and a curious and sophomoric case of RDS (Reagan Derangement Syndrome).  Also, Littell could probably have lopped off the last 100 pages or so of this door stop of a book since, for all intents and purposes, the book had ended by then.  But the novel is one of the few books I've read in recent times that I truly could not put down.  Littell's uncanny knowledge of tradecraft, and his byzantine plotting involving some of the key events of our time combine to make this a book well worth reading. I'll knock off a star because of the book's imperfections but it's still a heckuva good read.
