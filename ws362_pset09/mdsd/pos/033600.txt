Leaving home to go live in the mountains would be hard during bad weather conditions.  It is the Gribley family tradition to leave home.   Every child decides to leave home and go live in the wilderness until their family comes to get them.  A child who is unsuccessful must return home with the family.  
  	A boy named Sam Gribley went to live in the Catskill Mountains and stayed there for ten years.   During those ten years, he finds out how to live in the wilderness by looking for a library to learn what to eat and what not to eat.  While living in the mountains, he also looked for the Gribley's farm.   He finds the farm by going to the library and asking the librarian, Ms.Turner to help him find ancient maps about the Gribley beech.  He succeeds in finding the Gribley Farm covered in moss.  He also found the fence surrounding it so that other hunters will not shoot animals inside his territory.  Sam makes traps to catch rabbits and other animals.  One day he sees a duck hawk flying around in the air, and Sam sees a nest where the Hawk was flying around. Sam goes to the cliff and climbs up to the nest and finds three little baby hawks.   The mother saw him and started poking into him with her beak. Sam took one of the babies and went to a flat place on the cliff and found some edges and climbed down with the baby hawk rolled up in his sweater. He got down, set down on a boulder and named the hawk Frightful.   Sam trained Frightful for the next 4 months and taught Frightful how to hunt, and catch his meat on a stick that Sam threw up in the air for Frightful's training.
