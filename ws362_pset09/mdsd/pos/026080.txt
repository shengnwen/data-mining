David Hare's Amy's View is a startling new play.  Rich, funny, sad,  absurd, and thought-provoking, Amy's View leaves the reader or audience  member clamoring for more.

This play meshes love and betrayal with the question of whether the theatre  is relevant in society anymore.   The reader will be astonished.  But being  lucky enough to see this play performed on Broadway with Judi Dench as  Esme, I love this play that much more
