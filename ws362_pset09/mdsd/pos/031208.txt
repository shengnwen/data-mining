I checked this book out at our local library, but it will definitely be one we purchase to add to our collection.  Yes, there is slang on a lot of pages, and there may be some errors as a reviewer mentioned between cocoons and a chrysalis.  However, the book grabbed my son's attention, and he can tell me the important theme of the book.  He is only 3, but he knows that it's important to choose your friends by who they are and not what they look like.  I'm ok with a few "technical errors" if he will remember this lesson in life.  An added bonus - he's loving his book time, and that is priceless
