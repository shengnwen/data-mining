After reading this book, I decided I hate travel guides but love travel writing.  Travel guides tell you where to go so that you'll run into more pasty, spoiled americans like yourself; travel writing gives you a sense of the land and the people.  I loved this collection of essays because it took me to other places and educated me about their history and inhabitants.  I learned about the yuppification of Nantucket, the bloody past of Zanzibar, ethnic conflicts in western China, a brutal kidnapping in Uganda, the environmental efforts in Bhutan.  Some pieces are frightening; some are humorous.  All are enlightening.  My only complaint is that I wish more pieces by women had been included -- I would have liked to hear more about the experiences of women in exotic lands.  All in all, a fine collection of essays
