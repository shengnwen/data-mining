I love Dumas.  There, I admit it.  I've been bred on Dumas.  (And those who think this book is atypical Dumas, simply haven't read much Dumas :) ).  Sadly, much of Dumas' works get burried under poor and inaccessible translations where the translator apparently thought "This takes place 300 years ago - let's make it sound that way!"  Luckily, this new translation is true to the Dumas style - it feels contemporay and speeds you through the action with ease and fun (as much fun as you can have reading about the bloodbath that was the French Revolution).

This is classic Dumas - the adventure, the intrigue, the history, the fascinating characterizations, and in this new edition it feels vibrant and fresh
