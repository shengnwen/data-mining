I usually only read historical romance but when a friend gave me this book I was hesitant to read it. But, once I started I couldn't put it down. This was my first Nora Roberts book and it was delightful. It tells the story of Princess Adrianne who has been planning all her life to steal back a necklace, The Sun & The Moon, to get (as the title says) sweet revenge on her father who she absolutely hates for the painful and slow death he caused her mother. But all her plans get interupted when Phillip Chamberlain enters Adriannes life and uncovers her deepest darkest secrets. The book kinda has a James Bond feel to it since Phillip & Adrianne are master theives and plan to do the last and biggest job of their 'criminal' careers. The only thing I didn't like is that the sex scenes are very brief and much is left to the imagination-they just leave you hanging. But, overall its a worth while read that will keep you on your toes till the very last page.
