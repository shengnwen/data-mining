I came across this gentle book while shopping for gifts for my daughter's 6th birthday.  This is a book about friendship and that is a very important subject to kindergarteners.  I felt the author approached the subject in a beautiful and touching way, showing how friendship can endure through the many changes that life will bring.  I can't wait to read the book to my daughter.  I plan on buying more copies to give to my friends, too
