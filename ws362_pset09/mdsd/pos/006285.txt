Katz does a wonderful job in dissecting history and presenting his thesis in a clear, concise manner. This book is valuable to Historians and people who are interested in history. Some people may feel a little lost or overwhelmed in the text of the book which looks at the concept of sexual deviance legally, socially as well as historically. It is important to know the Homosexuality is a modern construct of the 20th Century. This book is about men struggling to name and identify what was yet to be named. The passages dealing with the legal definition of sodomy are crucial towards understanding the roots of prejudice against homosexuals today. Great book
