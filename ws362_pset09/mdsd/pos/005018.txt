Margaret Coel writes an intriguing mystery which is based on the photographs which Edward Curtis took of the Plains Indians in the early 1900's.  Curtis recreated battle scenes by hiring
Indians to dress like their forefathers and relive scenes from the past.  During one of these photo sessions an Arapaho woman is shot and killed.  Her Anglo husband testifies that he saw three Indians murder his wife.  With this as a background, the book shifts to the present-day Wind River Reservation, where an Arapaho woman is found dead.  Father John O'Malley and Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden discover a connection between the Curtis photographs and the recent murder.  Their investigation threatens a politician who is running for Senator and who advocates mining the natural resources on the reservation.  As usual, Vicky and Father John grapple with their feelings for one another as they attempt to solve the murder and to do what is right.  This is an altogether satisfying mystery which gives the reader a look at history and a feel for the Arapaho culture
