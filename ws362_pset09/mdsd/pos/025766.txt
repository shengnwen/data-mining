I enjoyed reading The Soft Edge.  I found Levinson to be a little long in his summations.  I also found that his first two chapters were confusing.  I was not sure of his direction or the purpose of his book.  His use of  mini-headings in each chapter did make each subject easier to understand.   I would highly recommend this book for research in other classes.  I have  already used it.  I did find his use of quotes from other authors leaving  me wanting more.  He used them to prove his arguments.  Without more from  that author, I was not able to accept or decline his argument.  I believe  his weakest part was on the future of technology.  Levinson gives a great  history and analysis on the impact.  I found his analysis on the future  small and quite unassuming
