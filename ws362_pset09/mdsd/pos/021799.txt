I am a personal growth coach and I do some work in the area of sexuality.  There are many people that are inhibited around their fantasies or feel guilt for having normal sexual feelings.  I feel this book is useful because it provides a wide array of different types of fantasies that are common in themes in the female population.  This can be a very helpful book to help people normalize their feelings of shame and guilt around their innocent fantasies.

I also like that this book provides some psychological interpretation of female fantasies and is organized around themes.  The content is erotic, but tasteful.  On the other hand, people's authentic experience is captured and the content is not necessarily sugar-coated.

I think this book will appeal more to women than to men.  Among other things, it will help women to realize that they are not unique in having certain desires that they don't fully understand or want to have happen in real life.

Two other great books that describe the psychology of sex and sexual fantasy are THE EROTIC MIND by Jack Morin and THE EVOLUTION OF DESIRE by David Buss
