What happens when the world is eradicated of a hugely destructive disease and scientists decided to keep some vials of it stored for research purposes? What happens when some of those scientists worked for the former Soviet Union and nobody really documented what happened to the vials after the breakup of said Soviet Union? What happens if this is real and not fiction?

If you're not freaking out by now, then Richard Preston will do a much better job of getting you there. Like his previous non-fiction thrill ride "The Hot Zone," Preston delivers a horrifying look at what can happen when procedures and documentation go by the wayside and a deadly disease is possibly exposed to the masses.

"The Demon in the Freezer" is a chilly story about the eradication of smallpox and how and why there are still samples of it existing in our world. You can't help but feel vulnerable after reading this book and and you can't help but wonder why in the world anybody needs to keep smallpox in storage.

Preston has an amazing talent for keeping the scientific jargon in layman's terms and keeping the reader on the edge of their seat as they wonder whether or not it could all happen to them. A page-turner at its core, you'll have a hard time putting it down, particularly at night with the prospect of sure-to-come nightmares about an outbreak of smallpox
