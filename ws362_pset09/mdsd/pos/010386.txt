Think and Grow Rich is a classic. After reading and listening to hundreds of audio books in this subject, Napoleon Hill set the foundation for a philosophy that empowers people towards their greatness. 

This book has helped me in various ways and it is my favorite book to come back to and read over and over again!

I highly recommend it,
