The plot for this is quite similar to Pamuk's Snow, though they are set in different times.  A man returns to Turkey and visits a former teacher who asks him to create the text for an illuminated book being created in the western style to impress Venice with the power of the Ottoman Sultan.  Just before his return, a gilder who works on the project is killed, and soon after he returns, his former teacher is killed.  All this is different from Snow.  The similarity is that he visits his former teacher in order to catch a glimpse of the teacher's daughter, an old flame who he has heard has been widowed.  She says she will marry him if he can find out who the killer is. And another, dangerous man wants her too.  So the love story is similar to Snow's.  How much you like this will depend on how much you prefer contemporary over historical fiction.  I felt this one was slowed down too much by long debates over the value of western vs. islamic painting. Rather than creating suspense these delays left me yawning despite their tangential relevance to the recent Danish cartoon controversy
