This book is perfect for anybody who has just purchased an airbrush or has just a little exerience. This book is slanted to modelers (cars, planes, and fiqures) and as such I would not recomend this book if you are not intending to use your airbrush for that purpose. But the book does take you thru a step by step procedures for which airbrush is right for which project, and list some other equipment to use. It even gives a quick description for how to build a cheap spraybooth. The author of the book is mostly known for his work in model cars so many of the techniques that the are slanted toward that purpose but he does delve into someother types of models.  The thing that I most appreciated about this book is the ALL of the pictures are in color.
