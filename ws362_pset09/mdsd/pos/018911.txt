James Lee Burke! Anything written by him is a joy to read, but I especially love his Robicheaux novels. This one is no exception. I anxiously await his future novels. His writing is pure poetry. I recommend all of his books; try to read the Robicheaux novels in order. You won't be sorry for the money or time spent on Burke's books
