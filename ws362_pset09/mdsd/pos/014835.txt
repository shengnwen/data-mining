This was a really fascinating book, weaving early twentieth century American historical figures with fictional characters.  I found the characters of Evelyn Nesbit, Harry Houdini, Pierpont Morgan and Henry Ford to be very interesting.  Emma Goldman as well.

I enjoyed the inventive conversations between historical figures fascinating, particularly the one between Pierpont Morgan and Henry Ford.  It was also really funny. 

I also found the fictional characters to be interesting.  Coalhouse Walker was interesting, although I am not sure what I think about his transformation.  

All in all, this was a highly inventinve book, and I recommend it, particularly to people interested in this time period in history.
