This is a wonderful book for those not interested in deciphering the English translation, which can be most difficult.  It is straight forward, with all the information needed for imediate use.  It stirs your imagination to desire the highest ideals, and gives information on exacting those ideals or actions.  Years ago I studied an english version of the I Ching, but never understood it as clearly as I do now, and therefore only applied it to problems.  After reading the brief but concise info on how and why this book is used, I am applying it to all aspectds of life, living, my enviornment, and more; with ease and awe
