I was unfamiliar with Katherine Anne Porter before reading this book and am now glad I picked it up. Porter has an amazing way with words and with characterization. With only a few sentences you feel as if you know the people in her stories. This book contains 3 short novels of which I think Pale Horse, Pale Rider is the best. Miranda is a young woman working at a newspaper during the last year of the first world war and of the tragic flu epidemic which killed millions. She goes from show to show every evening writing reviews for the paper, never sure why she bothers. She is alive, but not living. She dines and dances with a soldier she loves but knows the relationship is pointless as he is being shipped overseas in a few days. Then she contracts the flu and the end is a harrowing description of the effects of the disease.

Noon Wine is the second strongest in my opinion, detailing a small Texas family dealing with the aftermath of the father murdering a man. It may have been in self defense, but it might not have been, you are left with the question and the family is left with the guilt and shame.

Old Mortality tells of the sad life of Gabriel through the eyes of his two young nieces. The woman he loves puts him off for a lengthy time while flirting with other men. Finally, though she doesn't love him, marries him and dies 6 weeks later. Gabriel never completely recovers.

These novels are beautiful and sad, filled with complex characters trying to get through each day while figuring out why they are doing it.
