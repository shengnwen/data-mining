A Great murder mystery for those who are intrigued by mysteries and other themes such as suspense, betrayal, and loyalty. For people who are not into mysteries. This novel has a combination of mysteries and actual historical events which took place such as World War I which took place during the late 1914's and the Ku Klux Klan . The first page of the play has a hook which draws you further into in the book and makes you want to read more and find out "who done it."	
This book could also be compared to "The Murder on the Orient Express" by Agatha Christie with the same story line and events but with different setting and plot. 
BUT!!!! Even though the play has many good scenes it would have been better if acted out rather than to have been read. It also gets somewhat boring and confusing towards the end because you might have for gotten but everything comes together during the last few pages. I found the book to be a page turner with new clues, hints and evidence in each page, and I would give it four out of five stars because it has a good plot and storyline.
