This is a really good book. It's written in an easy to read, accessible style but addresses some really big issues. The content is good because it normalises the experience that so many brides go through, of feeling scared or anxious about their approaching wedding, despite a good relationship with their partner. And it gives hope for how this will improve. Definitely worth a read for all brides.
