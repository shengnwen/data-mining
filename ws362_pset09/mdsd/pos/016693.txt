The first review I posted was that of 'the great gatsby', and now this.

A somewhat controversial story written in poetic prose and riddled with thought-stopping insights on life, on love and age which are as forceful as the underlying moral of the story is subtle. The only disappointment was the ending - not the ending itself but the fact that the book came to an end in under 130 pages of pure reading pleasure. The quotes listed in the other reviews here are in themselves beautiful, but don't do justice to the context in which they were used and adjacent paragraphs that they accompanied.

A great, gripping read that just whets the appetite and satisfies the senses with elegant sufficiency
