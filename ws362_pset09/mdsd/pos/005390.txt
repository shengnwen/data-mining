I have also read the work of Marija Gimbutas, have done pencil tracings of many of her illustrations and am working on a few ceramic miniatures and computer artwork using some of the Neolithic decorative motifs.  I have  also completed a short story set in Neolithic Europe.  Mary Mackey,  however, is a far better and more involving storyteller than I probably  will ever be.  Anyone longing for a better, more peaceful and egalitarian  world cannot help but become emotionally involved in all three volumes of  the Earthsong Trilogy series.  One minor quibble: the front cover  illustrations of the smaller paperback editions are utterly absurd.  Mackey  clearly states that Marrah's (the heroine/priestess') deerskin dress came  down to &quot;about mid-calf&quot;; the illustrator has it coming to about  mid-thigh, making it awfully tricky if one ever had to bend over.  The  front covers of The Horses at the Gate and The Fires of Spring are even  sillier; nobody could survive a winter on the Ukrainian steppes dressed  like THAT (see the cover of Horses at the Gate); and the young woman  warrior's costume on the cover of The Fires of Spring owes more to Xena  than anything Neolithic people would have actually worn.  But the  storytelling is marvellous; in fact I would love for these stories to be  filmed, and I would like to take part in writing the musical scores for any  films that come of these stories.  If this may be coming in the future,  please contact me at karen@capitolhill.net to discuss
