If you like problems and interesting things you better get this book and read it. I rate this book 4 stars because the kids always had a    problem. Of course, Mrs Piggle Wiggle had to find a cure for the kids. Such as Sharon- she needed a powder that was called the Heedless Breaker Powder.  She needed that powder because she would always break something. I thought  that this book was great. I would recommend this book to ages 6 and up
