This is a beautiful book. 
I was most impressed with how Greer was able to take what might have been a totally implausable story line and make it work. The absurdity of Max's condition is not a distraction here. It could easily have been a really bad book, but Greer pulled this off. 
It is a story of the importance of timing in life and in love, and how easy it is to miss what we really want. It is a reminder of the fragility of relationships, even in the presence of true love and many chances.
