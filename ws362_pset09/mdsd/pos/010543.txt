This book brings together the brilliant work Donaldson did at Oxford during the early 1980s. The unique properties of 4-manifolds are clearly and concisely written out with concentration on explaining field theories  like Yang-Mills and gauge theory with a truly firm mathematical foundation,  presented in a book for the first time. A great companion for any  researcher in the field of geometry and topology, or even loop quantum  gravity
