I have always wanted to understand fundamental economic ideas without all the statistics and other junk. This book was exactly what I wanted. It explains important economic theories in easy to understand ways. At the end of the book it also explains how the Federal Reserve can influence the economy. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants an overview of how capitalistic market economies work
