I bought this book the day after I found out I was having twins and didn't put it down my entire pregnancy.  This is a wonderful book.  It's written with the unique joys and trials of a multiple pregnancy spelled out clearly.  The author is factual and friendly without being preachy like some other pregnancy books I read. It covers both the emotional and physical aspects of a multiple pregnancy and does a great job of preparing the reader for labor and birth(s)
