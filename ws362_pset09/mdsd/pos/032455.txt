This is my first experience with Ann Patchett and won't be my last. I loved her writing style even though the character development didn't always make sense. Why did everyone love Rose so much when she was so cold and shut down? The explanation for leaving Thomas, and her mother whom she loved deeply, didn't make sense to me. The story however was beautifully written albeit sad. I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but I think that had to do with more with finding the Lorraine character incredibly annoying. I'm anxious to read my next Patchett novel.
