A trip to the shore calls for The Book of Mermaids. Author/illustrator Patricia Saxton draws from many cultures and her own imagination to create a fanciful picture book on merfolk arts, language and family life. These sea creatures (half fish, half human) were revered in ancient times as powerful gods and continue to surface in popular culture....Youngsters will have a great time learning about mermaids' mystical tools (pearls and blue stones), weaving their own mermaid tales and poring over Saxton's shimmering mixed-media illustrations, which further heighten the magical quality of these legendary beings
