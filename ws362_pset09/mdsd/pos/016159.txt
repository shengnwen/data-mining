I looked at many pregnancy organizers and journals before deciding on this one. What I wanted most was a calendar that I could start at anytime (nothing too structured), a place to track prenatal visits & questions, a place for class notes, and pertinant lists & charts & timelines. This one fits the bill for the most part, but it was really the fact that it wasn't pink with pictures of ducks & puppies that I bought it. What I would like to see is some pockets to hold all the info sheets I get at my appointments (I only found 2 with this feature) and more space for notes
