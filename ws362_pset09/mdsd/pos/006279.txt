A Revolution of Love: The Meaning of Mother Teresa  is a beautifully written book. In fact, it is so well written, I classify it as a devotional book, one that a person could read as part of his prayers. The book, however, would fascinate even the non-believer, since it is a biography, and one that is loaded with the significance and meaning of a life more than with a catalogue of facts. I couldn't put it down. I was deeply moved, and I kept thinking of people I could send it to--especially those outside the Church. David Scott established a daunting goal--to explain the meaning of Mother Teresa, not only her place in history or in her country, but also her place in the eternal workings of God, her place in the whole salvation history of mankind. And he succeeded beautifully and with very few words. The book is impressionistic in the best sense of the word. I am left with a picture of such illuminative beauty amid the blood-soaked, dark, twisted and brutal landscape of  modern times-a landscape which Scott also brilliantly evokes. Very ably, Scott shows that God sent Mother Teresa to send a message of utmost importance to the world. I couldn't help but think that for all the publicity Divine Providence ordained she should get, the world still has not listened. Yet her life brought me much hope. I simply loved the book.
