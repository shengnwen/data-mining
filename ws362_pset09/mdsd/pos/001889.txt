Are you sick and tired of saying hello to someone in the morning and being ignored? Need some way to respond when someone offers advice that you didn't ask for? Have co-workers who are whiners and complainers? This book has some nice guidelines to follow, and offers some reasons we should not respond in kind when people are rude to us. This is a good one to leave in the office lunchroom if you think the right people would even recognize themselves in the scenarios. Not preachy; just good common sense
