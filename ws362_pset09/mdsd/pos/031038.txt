This is not a faddish, Super Secrets of Getting Rich Quick book. It is a practical guide to not staying poor due to lack of information, and not  becoming poor through bad financial judgement. 

I have found this book very helpful in doing exactly what the title says - making the most of my money. While I can't say the this book was an easy read, it was worth the effort. I have been successful in avoiding consumer debt, keeping my credit rating healthy, setting up an investment plan, and generally sleeping better at night because I now know where my money is and what it is up to. I have read other financial planning and investment books since this one, and many of them have sound and useful information, as far as they go. None, however, seems as comprehensive and reliable as this one.

Here is my advice for you if you think you need to know more about money, but feel that a book this huge is too intimidating or time-consuming. Do what I did. Start with the chapters that are most relevant to your current situation. Got a problem? Look it up and read the parts that make sense. Then go back again and again, and read some more until you really understand that chapter or section (in my case, it was sentences at first).  Eventually, it will become easier, and you can eventually master everything you need from this book by taking it in stages. 

I love this book!!!
