This book details the discovery and eventual publication the an ancient codex of the Gospel of Judas.  It describes the serpentine journey this codex took from the time it was found to its final preservation and publication by the National Geographic Institue.  You must look elsewhere for the actual translation of the gospel, however, this story is full of intrigue and interesting characters and is well told.  The book also gives us background details that explain the history of the codex and its probable authors.  Although it describes a Judas that is very different from the biblical Judas, it is up to the reader to put this view into the context of the gnostic beliefs that were probably the basis for its original publication in the second century
