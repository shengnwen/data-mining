I love the southwest having grown up in Salt Lake City, California, and visiting my grandparents in Mesa, Arizona. Hillerman has created his own unique genre...because there is no one who deals with Native americans and their own problems. This book especially was good because a few years ago they had many young people die from the Hantavirus (Hillerman adds the bubonic plague...but the Hantavirus is the main concern down there. With too much water, the pinion trees produce too muchand encourages the population growth of mice and rats who live under the homes of the Native Americans. When their fecal matter dries out, it aerosolizes and exposes the lungs to the virus in the fecal matter. the Center for Disease control had their hands full with that one.

Leaphorn and Chee are two diverse characters...each with their own flaws. Trying to be a cop down in that area must be very stressfull since they have to patrol large distances with huge problems, including being careful of the many diverse tribes with differnt religious beliefs and the need to honor those beliefs.

Hillerman knows the four corners area (Utah, arizona, colorado, and New Mexico) well. This particular story had to do with illegal poaching of eagles in that area, as well as people dying from exposure to a resistant strain of plague virusl. These guys are expected to be and do impossible things including deal with bodies that may have infectious disease in them and trying to get tribal permission to do autopsies, since most of the Navaho and Arapahos and Utes do not believe in desecrating the body of the deceased.

Interesting topic and a good read.
