If you or your spouse have heart disease, or a genetic predisposition to it, or you want to discuss your options rationally with your MD or cardiologist, this is a SUPERB book, a MUST READ.  Dr Sinatra provides the technical research backup that a doctor or cardiologist would want, as well as explaining in easy to read, layman's terms: how the cardiovascular system functions, how the common heart drugs work (or fail to work), and how vitamins, minerals and supplements can not only help but also save lives.
