His first book in the series, Knots + Crosses, was straight-forward and less than 200 pages.  This tome is closer to 400 and has more twists, turns, obfuscation, dead ends, cul-de-sacs and out-and-out right lies than a politician's testimony.  Rankin also brings back Rebus' partner, Jack Morton, from the first book, to help Rebus get back on track.

That this story is based on the real 'Bible John' killer, the books antagonist, 'Johnny Bible' is fictitious.  How close does Rebus get to the two killers?  Read the book.  

Rebus is tied to the killings because he happens to have had contact with one of the murdered woman.  But, at the same time he is dealing with Brian Holmes break-up with Nell over his being a 'copper', trying to work out a relationship with Gill Templer, and finally coming to grips with his alcoholism.  

It's nice to see Rankin address Rebus' problem with addiction (to booze and cigarettes).  He is able to deal with it directly without a lot (actually little) preaching.  John has a problem, and Jack (who has cleaned up) is the one to point out what has been staring him in the face for the last two books.  He is drinking to numb himself to his problems with his lack of personal relationships.  Missing though is any mention of Patience, as if she and there relationship never existed.  

Guessing that John is now in his middle forties, and has been a heavy smoker and drinker for the last dozen years at least, he doesn't seem to have any physical effects from it.  In fact, once again, out galant inspector, gets the snot beaten out of him, and more than once, without any long term effect.  This is one of the few things in his (John and Ian's) character, that doesn't ring true.  As always, everyone will get credit for solving the myriad of cases in this book, but John.
