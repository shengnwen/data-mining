This is a very well writen book with information that soon to be or wants to be law students would find invaluable. Montauk break the book down into chapters that deal specifically with problems that applicants would have. You don't have to read the entire book to find what you need. The comments and advices from many admission officers from top law school across America give the readers a solid understanding what is expected of them. Granted that this book won't make the average applicants into fit-in for the top law schools out there; instead it give them a simple guide to utilize the resources and talents they have and accentuate their strength and find way to make their application stand out. The message here is very universal; you could be applying to Average Joe Law School or the Ivy-League and find the advices useful. There are no super secret to get into top Law school, it mostly common sense, this book don't bring anything new to the table, but it does provide the most details and present them in a great format. Also the essays at the last chapter provide great examples. Overall I highly recommend this book.
