Okay, let me be the first to say that I don't understand what that guy means when he said "C.S Lewis is not a Christian."Why would he write this? Maybe I am retarded or something but anyway,my aim is not to start a stupid is he a christian or not argument.We have enough of that in this damn country of ours.This is one of the great literary works of faith period.And I am talking of any faith.As a piece of literature alone it is excellent.This man surely had a very deep thought process and it shows.I mean this book is so deep that you might have to read it twice to get it.In this day and age where religion and especially Christianity is derided and not respected (hell,even I don't respect alot of religion and Christianity-can you blame me!)this work from C.S Lewis is a breath of fresh air.It never becomes about religion but rather the inner mind and spirit and how to relate that to the spirit of God and the spirit of Christ.It definitely is a great book on spirituality and man.This book is good for anyone even if you don't consider yourself as someone who would like this kind of stuff-you will put it down encouraged
