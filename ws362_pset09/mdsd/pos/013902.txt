This is an excellent book.  I was coming from a novice OpenGL user and wanted to branch out from OpenGL, to understand more impressive CG techqniques.  He uses OpenGL, but it's the underlying techniques that make this book impressive.  He goes beyond the API and delves into a number of interesting areas.  Good overall introduction, with a fair amount of code examples and discussion of how to modifiy what he gives you.  Not perfect, I would have liked another chapter about radiosity, or more ray tracing, but really excellent.
