It is only a few days before the 30th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. If there were ever a book to read about the meaning of that event from a more than just analytical point of view, this book is it! 

This is a very personal story of a boy who becomes man through a collection of harsh events, not the least of which was being an American child living in Vietnam during the war; and later in 1983, becoming the first American political prisoner held by the Hanoi government since the fall of Saigon. The memoir starts in 1968 and ends in 1999. I can think of no other book that comes close to the understanding that goes far beyond any 'history' book, and do not be surprised by the author's skill in use of imagery to really capture a time and place!

I felt as though I were watching a movie, captured by the author's descriptions that made me forget I was reading and not actually experiencing.

After reading so many books that talk about how enriched they were by the events in their past, this author can say it without having to make the reader feel as though he would also have to go through psychological counseling: this books is a wonderful, and very uplifting read! This is a book that helps the reader really appreciate what he or she has in their lives!

If there were anything worthwhile to come out of the Vietnam War and the pain following in the US and all of Indochina, this book is it
