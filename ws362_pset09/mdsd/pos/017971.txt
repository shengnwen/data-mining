Our two older kids basically didn't fall asleep on their own for a long time, as well as woke up quite frequently at nights. We were big followers of Sears method. I think, our nervous system was quite drained as a result of bad and insufficient sleep.

With our third child we finally decided to try to teach him to go to sleep and sleep on his own and our pediatrician recommended this book.

Must note that, as the book warns you, it was NOT an easy thing for us as he cried for about 10-20 minutes for almost a week before falling asleep. He also did wake at night two-three times. We did come in after increasing intervals to be with him for a minute or so and it seemed to help him to cry less and less.

After two weeks he started sleeping through the whole night which was like a miracle to us. Now, a month later he sleeps 11-12 hours at night. 

It is not true that we became desensitized because our 3 year old still wakes up sometimes and we have to respond to her calls.

The most important lesson from the book we learned is 
1) Baby remembers how he falls asleep, i.e. associations. So if he falls asleep on his own when he goes to bed he is more likely to fall asleep when he wakes up at night (which is BTW quite normal). So if we have to breastfeed him to make him to sleep he will ask for it everytime he wakes up.
2) Maintaining schedule is hugely important due to the inherent body rythms.

Good luck to everyone
