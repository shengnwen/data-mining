If you have been to Disney a ton of times, This is the book for you. If it's your first time I think you'll enjoy it as well, BUT for you returners get ready to see the park in a hole new light.  Whether you're with the kids or just a bunch of fun loving adults you got to try this. The book is set up like a scavenger hunt (for hidden Mickeys) and will give you excellent hints on where to look (with out giving away the exact location) and at the same time show you the best way to see each park. As a 34 year veteran I know my way around and this is just the way I do the parks (for the most part)shortest lines and most attractions covered. The book includes a scoring system witch is great for deciding who is picking up the bill for the next meal. But how ever you do it, it is lots of fun. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did
