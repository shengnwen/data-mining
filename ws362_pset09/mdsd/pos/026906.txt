I am surprised that there are not more customer reviews. Much of the material about church life style is rather out of date since the book was published in the early 70's, if my memory serves me well. But it contains possibly the only in depth interview with Reverend Sun Myung Moon to be  published. I am still impressed by Rev Moon's candour and how consistent  his remarks then are with his staements now and the whole of his life. I  also find Professor Sontag's comments of great value, being unprejudicial  and thoughtful. Aparently this book is now out of print. I would suggest  that the Unification Movement still carries copies. Check... the Unification websites
