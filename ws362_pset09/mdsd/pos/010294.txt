The author clearly loves his work, the dogs and the outdoors and for much of this book we are entertained with his adventures.The rest of the book concentrates (loosely) on training your dog. I found it to lack the detail and layout to use as a training manual. Although it is a fine read I would prefer to see more of a reference manual and read the anectdotes with a cognac at the end of the day.
