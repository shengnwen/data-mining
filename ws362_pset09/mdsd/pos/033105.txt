This book is pretty good if you don't have a Bradley Instructor nearby.  However, it's deffinately not all inclusive... I found myself a little fuzzy on the diet.  The exercises were helpful in widening the pelvis, and preparing for labor.  My only problem is in the insitance in waiting for spontaneous labor, it didn't happen for me, we did an ultrasound and it's pretty bad when I can tell on an ultrasound that things aren't so great.  The information on all births being different should be handed out to all labor and delivery nurses because everyone kept swearing I wasn't in labor and that the baby wasn't coming until all at once within 30 min everything happened.  The relaxation techniques really helped though
