If you're going to college, in college, out of college, thought about going to college, driven past a college, dated someone who once saw a college, or just like movies ABOUT College, the CollegeHumor Guide to college is the best book you can buy, to fully grasp the College experience......

it's not so much a book about college (yeah, the focus IS college, but many lessons apply to life after college as well), as it is a survival guide for your 20s, but it's a fantastic, and genuinely humorous read......the lessons are numerous, and not dry in any way, it's realistic about the real-life college experience (Alcohol, drugs, skanky hookups, friends, frats, beer, etc.)

well worth the price (tho, I did get it for 30% off), if you see a copy, steal it (unless it's mine), buy it, or flip through it at the bookstore/library (THEN steal it), but READ THIS BOOK!

yes, I fully realize in three paragraphs, I used the word "College" fourteen times......

I don't know what everybody is complaining about.....aside from the drug use, and the fact that I was a 'GDI', my college experience was quite similar to this.....
