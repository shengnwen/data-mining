The best part of this book? everything. It's written well, well researched, funny as hell, poignant, educational and just so sweet.  

Believe it or not, as much as I loved the ads which were fantastic (Check out Lucille Ball's eyebrows on page 64) I would have prefered fewer ads,larger typeface and much more of the commentary (this author sure can turn a phrase).  I have read other books by this publisher, but this was the first one that felt like a book and not just a collection of images. In reading this I feel as though I had a conversation with a stylish girlfriend who knowsn everything about the beauty business. Talk about girlpower, this book was short but empowering and a hoot. 

I can't wait to read whatever comes next from this author. This is my new stocking stuffer/birthday/any or no occasion gift
