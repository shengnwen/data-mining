I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I will admit that I cried at the end of it. No joke. This novel fulfills the definition of comedy. It portrays the human  condition with both joy and sorrow and in a time frame that will be remembered by history. The Human Comedy shows the human side of a war that is chiefly associated with the clash of machinery, weapons and bombs. Saroyan successfully creates characters that we can care about in a realistic drama about life at the home front during WWII. It gives a final note of hope at the end; it finishes with the possibility of a marriage, a key element in the classic idea of comedy. The timeless dichotomy of suffering and joy along with its memorable setting establish this book as a classic
