This has been one of my sons favorite books from the beginning.  He is now 10 months old and has enjoyed having this read to him since he was 2 months old.  There are 3 other ones titled babies, cats, and dogs which are also excellent.  He now picks up the book and turns the pages as well as enjoys having them read to him. I would definately recommend this book for beginning readers.
