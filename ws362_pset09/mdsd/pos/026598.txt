I found the best parts of this book highly interesting and original, since I like any book that proposes a bold thesis. However, other parts of this book (in my recollection at least 200-300 pages out of 800) are just random thoughts on U.S. foreign policy and other material which is in no immediate way related to the main points of the book. Hence, I think I will be returning to this book again later, but only to the historical parts of it, which thankfully are separated from the other fluff clearly in the chapter labels
