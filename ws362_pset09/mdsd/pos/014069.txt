As a parent whose experiences are similar to Loux's I was grateful beyond words that someone has had the courage to publish a story like the ones I hear in whispers about &quot;my friend, my sister, my cousin&quot; who has experienced a troubled adoption.  I mean the stories where there isn't an upbeat ending about the power of faith, or hope or unconditional love.  Why do I hear so many of these stories and see so few in print?  It's time that people who have spent countless days and nights and dollars in a fruitless quest to reach a troubled child be heard and believed and not blamed. Thank you Ann Kimble Loux
