A really fun game.  Short of like playing Dungeons and Dragons, but with pre-made Star Wars Characters with special abilities.  The more you collect, the more you can combine them into special teams for special operations.  "Rebel Storm" is just one of the many expansion modules available.  You have other that are still in print like, "Champions of the Force", "Endor", and "Universe"  Others that are out of print "Revenge of the Sith", and "Clone Strike".  Soon to be released in September 2006 is "Bounty Hunters".  Have fun
