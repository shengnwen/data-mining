What a fun little read, chockablock full of  delectable saturnine, sardonic and downright surly one-liners that spew from the smirks and smiles of our favorite dicks, dames and dolls.  "My first wife was a second cook at a third rate joint on 4th St."  -The Glass Key,  is  particular favorite of mine...But there are so many more to chew on...like so many mordant morsels.  Some are complimentary,e.g. "You'd look good in a shower curtain" -Cody Jarrett -"White Heat" but most bite to the bone.  "You've gotta study to get that stupid" -Radak "Desperate"  This tiny compendium of sarcasm  is complimented with an arrestingly appropriate graphic style that is both simple and effective.  Have this by the bedstand and the next time your wife or hubby gives you some grief...turn to page...30  "I'll never think of our moments together without nausea". Now what can you say to that? -ND
