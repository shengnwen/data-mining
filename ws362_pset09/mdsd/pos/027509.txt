I really enjoyed reading what the Economides shared about living a "thrifty" life.  This is full of basic advice for living a frugal life, but even those who have been practicing thrifty living can learn a few things.  I especially enjoyed their section on how to save on groceries (although I haven't yet tried to do all my shopping for the month in one day) and their chapter on children's allowances.  For those who are trying to get out of debt, I'd recommend starting with the chapter on budgeting.

The book is very well-written and fun to read.  If you're inspired and want to read more, I'd recommend the Tightwad Gazette by Amy Dacyczyn and Your Money or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence. by Joe Domingue
