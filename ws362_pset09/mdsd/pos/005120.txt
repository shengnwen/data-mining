I couldn't wait to be finished with this book until I finished it, and then I was really sad.  It's over 900 pages, so settle in.  This epic Arthurian tale is from the female perspective and has much to do with love, religion, and kingcraft through a few different generations.  It beautifully features orgies, heresy, gay and lesbian love, time warps, gruesome deaths, lots of adultery, threesomes, and love triangles.  Gwenwyfar is overzealous and unintelligent, Morgaine is the star-crossed villain who is resigned to deny her heart and only serve her religion, Arthur's secret is that he wants only to please everyone else, and Lancelet is only strong enough to be a little bit bad, which is worse than being all the way bad.  There are dozens of other characters too, and the author is talented enough to distinguish them pretty well.  I also like the perspective on medieval life- they only eat cheese, bread and meat, for instance, even the royal women are illiterate, and their culture is slowly being integrated with Roman ideals and Christian beliefs.  This precarious keeping of balance between varying religions, genders, loves, lands, and warring tribes all has an underlying promotion of moderation and equality
