After seeing the Hellers on TV I was so impressed and inspired to get the book and check it out. But this is a life-style change and drastic at that!  How many people can commit to that!   I want to try it for health reasons.   But I only weigh 105 lbs and am concerned how it will affect me.  The diet  is centered around weight loss.  I don't want to loose weight.  I want to  feel better and stop the tired spells and bad eating habits.  This needs to  be addressed.  The concept is not new - the Atkins diet has been around for  20 years or so.  But I do hope this helps lots of unhappy people and I hope  more people hear about it
