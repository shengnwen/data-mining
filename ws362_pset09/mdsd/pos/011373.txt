My sister gave me her used copy of The Monkey Wrench Gang 5 years ago, stating, "This Book Will Change Your Life."  It is insightful, powerful, and beautifully written.  It made me look at the world in a whole new light.  It may not completely change your life, but it will certainly open your eyes to a great, seldomly spoken of, tragedy of the modern age: the death of the American West and Wilderness throughout the world in the name of "Progress."
Read it.  Give it a chance (the first chapter is hard reading, wonderfully written, but complex: don't give up after 5 pages, it gets much more exciting!) You may just learn something
