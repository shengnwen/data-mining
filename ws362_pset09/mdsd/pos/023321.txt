The transcriptions in this book are very accurate and the cd that comes with it is very helpful. All the songs are played at performance speed and half speed so you can work your way through even the most ridiculously fast licks. I was a little disappointed that the tab for "Nuages" was not complete, but they give you the bulk of the transcription. All in all this is a must have for any serious jazz guitarist
