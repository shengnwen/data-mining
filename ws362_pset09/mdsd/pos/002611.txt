I picked this book up in a bed &amp; breakfast in Savannah during a recent trip to the south. I was absolutely charmed by it. I am a civil war buff, and truly enjoyed the glimpse of life as it was, in the words of one who lived it. I couldn't put it down, and felt like an adopted member of the family. The author has done a remarkable job of assembling this wonderful material and tieing it into a very readable package. I highly recomend this for anyone with any curiosity about the southern lifestyle of that period. My thanks to Richard Cote for providing me with this authentic slice of life, and also a wonderful Christmas gift for several friends!
