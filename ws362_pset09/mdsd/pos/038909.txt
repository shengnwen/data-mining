This book isn't about strategy at all. It's about playing the players, and all the funky stuff they do. I haven't seen anything else like it (and I've read alot of poker books). It made me smile with recognition, as all the stuff I knew about how players act was on the page. A quick read and miles from the usual odds and outs
