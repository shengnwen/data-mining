I bought this book after reading and enjoying Pollan's earlier book "The Botany of Desire". I found "The Omnivore's Dilemma" to be thought-provoking and interesting to read. Pollan traces the origins of 4 different meals as a way of working through the omnivore's dilemma of knowing what foods are good to eat. 

Pollan makes the facts and figures come to life by going to see the places where food is made, and isn't afraid to laugh at himself and his own reactions. But he challenges us to think hard about what we're putting into our bodies, and how we want to eat in the future. Just because we're omnivores who can eat nearly anything and survive, doesn't mean that everything available in a supermarket is good for the long-term health of our bodies and our planet
