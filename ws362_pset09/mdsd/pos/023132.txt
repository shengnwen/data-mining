There are suggestions for activities and conversation at the end of each chapter.  Read it alone or even better, read it as a couple.  Both men and women have written commenting on how much the book has helped their marriage. Chapter 4, "What Happened to the Good Times," Chapter 10, "Different Walls,"  Chapter 14, "The Fantasy of Something Better," and Chapter 17, "Dreaming New Dreams" are especially important if your marriage is hurting.  
Neil Clark Warren, founder of eharmony.com, has endorsed the book with this comment: For any man who wants to love his wife more deeply--and for any woman who is dying to be loved that way.
