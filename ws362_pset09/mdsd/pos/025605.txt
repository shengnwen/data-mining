Peter Telep's adaptation of the original screenplay blew the movie out of the stars!  I, for one, did enjoy the movie a great deal.  However, after reading the novel, the movie disappoints.  While Telep captures the essence  of each charater from the movie incredibly, you'd better hold on to your  hats for the twists and turns the novel took that the movie didn't show  you!  If you didn't like the movie, you'll still like the novel, and if you  DID like the movie, you'll LOVE the novel.  Highly recommended
