I am on a strict high protein diet so this was a very good book as it lists protein amts. for tons of foods.

My one complaint is it seems to list almost all pre-packaged or restaurant foods.  How 'bout a chicken leg you make or a hamburger not from Burger King?  I'd find it helpful if that type of info. were included as well
