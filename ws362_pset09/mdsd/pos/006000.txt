I was given the title of this book by a friend, who suggested I read it.  I was recovering from surgery for breast cancer, and what I read in this book made me realise that I needed to change my diet supplements to include a regime of anti-oxidants, both to help protect myself from further bouts of cancer, and to increase my general health by giving my body the building blocks it needs to heal itself. The book was easy to read, and extremely well referenced.
