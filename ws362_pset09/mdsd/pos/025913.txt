I've long believed in hypnosis/hypnotherapy as an answer for many diseases and ailments. In my search to learn more, and as I begin to work on becoming licensed myself as a hypnotherapist, I found and read Dr. Modi's amazing book. For all that hypnotherapists believe they are a few steps advanced from psychiatry, I now firmly believe that a hypnotherapist merely treating a patient with guided imagery, metaphor, and regression is not enough, and this book (and others dealing with spirit releasement) are the key to unlocking the vast resources within ourselves and our clients. Please give it a read, see if it doesn't make you at least wonder about what more you could be doing. A wonderfully proactive approach to healing, and a life-altering view of the universe presented in a logical and clinical manner
