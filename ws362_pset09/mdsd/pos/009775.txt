Why when Henri Bergson went to lecture to NY in 1913, his presence was celebrated like that of a famous actor? Why such a philosopher created the first traffic jam of the brand-new automotive age? DURATION, the sphere of  Life is certainly one of the great contributions of one of the most  profound thinkers of mankind. His ideas about time and form were certainly  ahead of his time... Time is experienced as a flow; but the concepts  through which time is measured are static...we commit a grave error...when  we confuse.. spatialized dimension for a dynamic and qualitative flow...but  Bersong was conscious of the need of a new, less mechanistic  biology...possible founded on a new mathematics...and he was thinking too  of a pulsational, quantum like model exhibiting both wave(continuous) and  particule(discontinuos) features...Maybe it is time to read Bergson again,  and maybe we will find a better way to that domain of the Being, where  affirmation is a complete act of the mind, and negation is only an attitude  taken by the mind toward an eventual affirmation..
