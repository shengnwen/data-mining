In response to Sophia's review - and for the benefit of those who might be misled by it - Wiesel's "Gates of the Forest" is powerful not because it is a story of the Holocaust, but because it is a story of Everyman. It is, at its core, a story of grappling with existence, yet without trying to label it as "the Absurd" (Camus), "Nausea" (Sartre), or "Dread" (Heidegger). Sophia, this is so much more than "just another Holocaust story," and I can't help but wonder if your zealous attempt to pigeonhole this incredible opus into that singular genre reflects a deeper fear you have of the themes of this book. After all, if this is "just another Holocaust story," you could explain away any bearing it might have on you as a person. But if it is more than that - and it IS MORE THAN THAT - then the book demands a reaction from you. To all the Sophias out there, this book is a life-changing read, but only if you are willing to live like someone who is alive. Your review saddens me, Sophia, but I am hopeful for you and others like you that one day you will wake up and decide to live deliberately. To those willing to think, this book is worth reading once a year, every year, for the rest of your life
