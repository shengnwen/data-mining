If you're thinking you'd like to get a boat and push off for more than a  few days, you should defintiely read this book first. It's not a manual for  sailing, but rather a manual for preparing to sail. It's full of the basic  kinds of information that budding cruisers need to know to help them decide  if the life is right for them, while still including enough detail about  boat types and systems to show that you don't have to be a rocket scientist  to cruise successfully. This should definitely NOT be your boat's bible,  but it's a very good and entertaining start to your library
