This work was not intended to bring to the forefront a great debate over the Armenian Question, Dr. Bouchard! The purpose of this work is to cover an extensive period of Ottoman history in a small amount of pages, and I think it is presented well. Merely rejecting the words of Dr. Shaw based upon such a narrow, controversial topic as the Armenian Question is not being true to the people who want solid reviews.

True the work is very detailed in its factual presentation, but it educates the reader on the many facets of Ottoman civilization. Too many authors of Ottoman history fail to get to the true meat of the matter, and Dr. Shaw does not dissapoint. I would recommend this to any student of Ottoman history as an overall guide to the events during the period it covers
