I found JBoss at Work to be a great guide that takes you through the basic JBoss setup and configuration. Its perfect for someone who wants to get an overview of the process and understanding of how JBoss works, but doesnt want to take the time to become an expert. It serves well as a guide on understanding J2EE general development and also highlights the JBoss specifics when appropriate.
The only downside for me was the tedious review of the J2EE XML configs. I would have preferred to see just the XDoclet code and not the additional XML that it generates. Use that time to focus on WHAT config files are necessary opposed to what actually gets generated and goes into them. Its beyond the scope of the book to go into all the XML syntax in the configs so its not worthwhile to try and make the reader understand this. Again, a little extra is not so bad, but it does fill a good portion of the book with something I believe could have been left out or supplemented with a better review of what each config file does and when to use them
