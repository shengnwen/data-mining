I found The Painted Word coyly sitting in a used book store looking like it needed a home. I actually neglected reading it for several weeks because I knew that once I started reading it, it'd go fast. Indeed I was right. I read it in one sitting smiling the entire way. It was delightfully amusing and at the same time it was also pretty down to earth. I've since passed my copy onto a friend and am still recommending it for a little evening pick-me-up even for people completely oblivious to the art world like myself. It did strike me as exuberant but I think that added life to it. Not only that but it was also historically interesting
