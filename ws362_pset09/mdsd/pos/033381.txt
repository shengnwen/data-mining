  I would recommend this book for the  reader who wants to have a ready source of information available to him about topics in philosophy and particular philosophers that he may encounter in his general reading of books dealing with history ,social science and biography.Some of the thumbnail sketches are too brief and a few contain incorrect information.For instance,the discussion of the principle of indifference(POI) references chapter 9 of J M Keynes's A Treatise on Probability.This chapter includes a brief summary of the POI.However,the main discussion of the POI occurs in chapter 4,not chapter 9(See p.410).The discussion of John Maynard Keynes contains an error.Nowhere in the General Theory(1936) does Keynes suggest or recommend a countercyclical fiscal policy based on deficit finance.In the period 1942-1944,Keynes did analyse and support the concept of a capital account ,separated from the rest of the government budget,that would deal with the financing of long lived infrastructure( public sector) projects that would  pay for themselves over the life time of the project.Only these types of projects would be initially funded by government borrowing.(See p.442)
