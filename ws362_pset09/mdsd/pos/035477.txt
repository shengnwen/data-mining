Ms. Murray has done it again with Jasmine.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, but definitely recommend you read "Temptation" before reading this; so that you will get a very close-up view of how devious Jasmine is.  Victoria Christoper-Murray is an excellent author of Christian-fiction novels and never disappoints.  Jasmine will make you want to slap her one minute and then feel sorry for her in another.  Pick up your copy today and you will enjoy
