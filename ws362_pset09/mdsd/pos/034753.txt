In typical Derridian fashion, Derrida circles the subject of Marx, peeking at it directly sometimes, but always speaking of it.  &quot;Of&quot; instead of &quot;to&quot; as Politics of Friendship points out.  Derrida is haunted, as we all should be.  The question is whether or not this is an ethical treatment of the problems brought to bear (a list of 10 - the ten commandments?) in the section entitled &quot;Wears and Tears (Tableau of an agless world).&quot;      This is a book about ghosts, about specters (and of course the specter of Marx).  His insights are once again profound (yet maybe a bit expected) when he calls the specter that which is neither present nor absent.  The specter's call, is of course, ethical, yet Derrida focuses less on this than would be expected.  Instead, Derrida is focuses on naming a few of the ghosts that flitter by.  This is less a book about politics than about the metaphor of the ghost, which I find unfortunate.      However, I did find this a valuable read.  Derrida has the ability to break questions wide open with his sharp deconstructive intellect, and this book holds no exceptions.  The specter is a figure of the &quot;to come&quot;, as well as that which is already here.  This book is like the begginging of a spider's web which can be stretched in many directions politically, thus it is certainly applicable and even practical (so maybe he's more Marxist than i give him credit for).  If one identifies the system as the ghost, then a large connection has been made which can span many political divides.    I recommend this book to any Derrida fan (like myself) and anyone interested in the critique of current politics.  The concepts worked out here are a great primer and beginning to the work which must come after, the work &quot;to come&quot;.  This book is the present of the &quot;to come&quot;.  Debt, Mouring, and Politics.  Read it
