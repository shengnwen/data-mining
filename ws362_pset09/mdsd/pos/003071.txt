"A Hawk for the bush" is a timeless classic on the training and keeping of the short-winged Hawks known as Accipiters. A must read for any falconer interested in trying his/her hand at these delicate and temperamental raptors. Jack Mavrogordato was truly a pioneer at managing and breeding, at a time when captive breeding of raptors was in it's infancy.

I highly recommend this book to the apprentice falconer considering flying a Accipiter upon turning General class. And to the Master falconer wanting to explore and glean knowledge from a man who truly had a passion for Accipiters.

As a bonus, there is a wonderful series of templates for hood making at the end of the book. Having made some of them myself, I can vouch for the great fit, and accuracy of these patterns. I keep returning to them year after year, when I want to make a good fitting Indian hood. That in itself is worth the price of the book!
