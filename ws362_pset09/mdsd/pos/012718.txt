This book was the perfect combination of a fascinating sci-fi plot, fast pacing that keeps your interest, and well-rounded characters. Sometimes even great sci-fi novels are bogged down with too many subplots and unnecessary diversions. This book kept to the point. The plot focuses on what would happen if an unknown force caused earth time to move slower than the universe outside it, thus causing everyone to believe that the sun will explode in their lifetimes. Highly recommended
