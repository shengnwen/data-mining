I did not know much about all the on going civil war in Africa.
Reading this such vivid stories of Benson, Alepho and Benjamin, I couldn't stop picturing 5-7 years old crossing the desert in bare foot.

I was so touched by their courage, hope and love for each other in spite of unimaginable hardship they went.

This book was such an eyeopening to what is going on in Afrida, refugree, vulnerable little children.

I strongly recommend this book to everyone regardless of ages.

Visiting www.theypouredfire.com, I was happy to read that Benson and Alepho found their mother who is still alive in Sudan.

Thank you for sharing your wonderful stories with us.
