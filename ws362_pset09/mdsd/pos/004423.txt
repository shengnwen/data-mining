I bought this book because I wanted to build a computer but was a little nervous about doing it.  This book tells you everything you need to know and gives you the confidence to build your own pc.  My pc build went flawlessly and I have this book to thank for it.  The illustrations are very helpful and informative.  I had a general knowledge of computers but had never built one from scratch.  This book is great for people that don't have much experience with computers because it explains everything in detail, describing all of the parts and has 3 different build configurations.  Pretty much everything is covered between the 3 different build so that no matter what kind you will build, it will be covered in this book.  I highly recommend this book
