Let me explain this book to you.  It has very little historical references.  To those who are familiar with Mrs. Buck's usually history-packed books, perhaps this will be somewhat of a surprise.   However, this book still has some non-fiction qualities.  The most  important and dominating example of this is the cultural picture that is  painted of a chinese family.  A common situation in America is illustrated  as it would happen in China.  From this, we truly learn about Chinese  culture and how greatly it contrasts to American culture.  This book is  also a tragedy too.  Very sad, yet quite enjoyable
