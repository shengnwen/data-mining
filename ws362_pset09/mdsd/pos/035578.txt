Hiaasen tackles the high-stakes world of tournament bass fishing in this romp through Harney County, Florida.  RJ Decker is a photographer-turned-PI who gets hired by rich brat Dennis Gault to catch TV bass-fishing star Dickie Lockhart in the act of cheating during a tournament.  Meanwhile, avid bass fisherman Bobby Clinch winds up dead, leaving behind a relieved widow and an orange Corvette-driving girlfriend, Lanie Gault, Dennis Gault's sleazy sister.  When Dickie Lockhart is found floating in a fish tank in New Orleans after a tournament, all hell breaks loose.  RJ turns to his odd new friends, the swamp-dwelling Skink, state trooper Jim Tile, and Cuban detective Al Garcia, rounding it out with his ex-wife Catherine, while they untangle a string of murders.  They're pitted against the Gaults, the cops, some bizarre redneck thugs, and the leadership of the Outdoor Christian Network, with a backdrop of televised bass fishing and some grisly happenings to pave the way.

Though not as laugh-out-loud funny as "Stormy Weather," "Double Whammy" was a highly entertaining read that did make me laugh out loud.  It's hard not to love the whole cast of good guys while sniggering at the idiotic, evil bad guys.  This one is four-star entertainment.
