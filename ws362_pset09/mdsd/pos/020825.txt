This looks interesting, but before I fork over $56 for a book I'd like to get at least another data point or two in the form of critical or blog reviews, but so far I haven't been able to Google up any such references. Nor have I found any information on the author (though having to search on just the provided first name may be making that difficult).  

Maybe I'm just using the wrong search terms.  Can someone help?

I mean no disrespect to the author or to other Amazon reviewers. To give the author the benefit of the doubt, I am awarding five stars. I still hope to get a bit more independent information so I can feel a bit more comfortable about purchasing this expensive book.

Alternatively, it would have been useful to have the "Look Inside" feature  so we could at least inspect a few pages
