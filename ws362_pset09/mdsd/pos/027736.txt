This is one of those books that gives great insight into the background stories of the movies.  If you like stories that closely relate to the movies, you'll enjoy this book.  It gives some background on the relationsship with Sidious and the Trade Federation as well as how Palpatine manouvers in the senate to position himself to be the runner up to Valorum as supreme chancellor.  I don't have the money or time to obtain and read every SW book or graphic novel. So if this sounds like you, I would say this is one of the SW books I would read. I would also highly recommend Labrynth of Evil, also by James Luceno for the same reasons I reccommend this book
