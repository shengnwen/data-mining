I find it suprising how so many people can not like this book? I read it immediatley after reading book 1 and still thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the details the author gives...it makes you feel like you are right there, and understand and see things as well as the characters do.

I can't wait for book 3, and hope everyone at least gives this book a chance and enjoys it as much as I did. Despite the reviews..
