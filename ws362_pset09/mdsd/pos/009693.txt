I really enjoyed this book.  It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it's definitely not fast paced.  I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.

Mr. Darcy is "pride" and Elizabeth Bennett is "prejudice".  These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves.  This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.

I really like Mr. Darcy.  He is the perfect gentleman.  He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge.  He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood.

Elizabeth is also wonderful.  She is doubtful about people and quite cynical.  I really like that about her.  It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.

My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly.  This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him.  Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself.  I would probably be charmed by him too!

This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Regency England
