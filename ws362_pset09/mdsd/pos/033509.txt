Only about two hundred pages, Jonathan Spence does a very noble job summarizing one of the most powerful, mysterious, fascinating, and frightening persons of the twentieth century.  Though if one is looking for a book that goes into detail about any aspect of Mao's life or policies, it is best to look elsewhere.  This book is a straightforward and unabashed introduction and quick overview of Mao's life and work and ideas.  Perfect for people curious about Mao and twentieth century China who want to read more than an abstract, but do not necessarily need or want to tackle a big and detailed work.  Just the facts and little commentary.  Spence does a good job balancing any bias against or for Mao and his policies and deals mostly with the reasons for them and overall consequences
