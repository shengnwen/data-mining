This was my favorite of the Evil trilogy because the reader got to know all the Kincaids in books 1 and 2 and they played prominent parts in book 3.  We even got to meet and love the mysterious Jack Kincaid.  Making Lucy, a character readers came to know and like, the victim of the vicious villain upped the suspense and scare level. 

This was an edge of your seat, can't put down thriller with an intelligent and romantic love story thrown into the mix.   

Warning - this isn't for the faint of heart.  Some, many, scenes are brutal, violent,  and very frank.  It was scary, but a very enjoyable read.  Allison Brennan is one of the best romantic suspense authors I have read and I can't wait for her next trilogy.  

Now I can catch up on the sleep I missed while I couldn't put Fear No Evil down
