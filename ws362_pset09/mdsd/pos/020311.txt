Lee calls for those who clamor for &quot;family values,&quot; especially evangelical Christians, to   step back and take a look at what they're actually promoting. Lee contends that &quot;values&quot; can change, and  can mean one thing for a   lesbian couple with children and another thing  for a traditional heterosexual couple with children. He also argues that  evangelicals and other conservative Christians have made an idol out of the  family, placing it even above church. Many of those same Christians also  have bought heavily into our therapeutic, materialist, divorce-oriented  culture, and &quot;family values&quot; even reflect some of that.      That  church community, Lee says, is where our priorities ought to lie and from  which our direction ought to come. While he  acknowledges the key role  family plays in Christian faith, he argues that Christian families are  simply part of the Christian Family, namely, the Body of Christ.      Lee  promotes Christian virtues -- in particular, faith, hope and love -- as  those things to which Christians should aspire, and it should be the local  congregation modeling these virtues, he says.   Christians are called to be  salt in the world, Lee points out, and this is accomplished not through  political victory but through cultural engagement and by giving priority to  the Kingdom of God.      While much of the book gets weighed down in  academic language and can be a difficult read at times in its opening  chapters, Lee's   central message still comes through clearly, especially  toward the end -- and it's a challenging message.      It's also one that  the &quot;family values&quot; crowd needs to hear. Sure, Christians should  have certain &quot;values&quot; to which they adhere, but these values have  deeper roots, and it's those roots -- Christian virtues -- to which Lee is  encouraging them to return
