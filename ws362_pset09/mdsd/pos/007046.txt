Reed's work definitely evokes the heady atmosphere of the Bolshevik Revolution, when it actually seemed as if the working class might rise up as one and seize the reins of power and therefore of its destiny.  It is the classic account of Red October as told from the viewpoint of an &quot;outsider&quot; who identified with the Revolution as a member of the universal working class.  However, it should not be forgotten that Louise Bryant was not only present as well but also wrote an account of her experiences.  Six Red Months in Russia is the indispensable companion to Reed's work; the two should be read in tandem.  As of the date of this posting (05.23.03) it is in print from Powell's Press.  Get it while you can.  It is a neglected gem of reporting from the Revolutionary frontlines which should command an equal amount of respect as does Reed's Ten Days that Shook the World
