For those unaware of Barbara Kruger herself, her images will surely be familiar. Bold, seemingly simple and effortless combinations of black and white images, many culled from '50s magazines, and thought-provoking text catch the viewer off-guard and make one think hard about exactly what the  artist is saying. Her themes range broadly over the spectrum of social  disenfranchisement and human rights, focussing especially on women's  issues. This book is a fantastic dossier of her collected images from the  last few decades. They remind the reader anew of her potency as a critic of  the patriarchal culture, and lose none of their impact when reproduced on a  scale smaller than the original. Interspersed with essays charting the  impact of her work, this catalogue provides copious illustrations of all  aspects of her work. Many images are familiar, but also included are newer  pieces, eg her later sculptural work, and other items of interest such as  magazine layouts and book covers. At about one inch thick, the book is  surprisingly light, all the better to carry around - after picking it up,  you won't want to put it down! For those who have never encountered Barbara  Kruger, this is an excellent, even exhaustive, place to begin. For those  who know her work already, read this now and rediscover her brilliance
