I recently started a book club with my friends (we all love to read!) :) This book was more than helpful in making our decisions on what to read next! We practically use it as our bible! Now thanks to this book we no  longer have quarrels about what to read, we can agree easily! I also use  this book on my own private time to decide what else I should read, I find  it very useful! I would say this book was very good and I would recomend it  to anyone! Happy reading
