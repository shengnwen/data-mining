This novel was one that had me trembling at the first page! I adore books about houses and mansions with some terrible secret. This novel did not dissapoint! In the style of Rebecca and Jane Eyre, this noel captured me from the start. 

I didn't like Green Darkness much, but I loved Katheryn. For some reason, this book captured my attention more, since it was more about haunting the mind of a young girl who travels to a mysterious house and becomes enchanted by it.
