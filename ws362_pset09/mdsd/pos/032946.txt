I think of this book as gas for my inner combustion engine. It's fuel, it turns the ignition key, but until something else starts to push the pedal to the floor, the car only idles forward. And, as we all know, you don't idle forward very fast. 

My recommendation would be to read this book to inspire you to make a change. It will make you think hard about your life to this point, and what you're going to think about your life when you're coming to the end of it. Then use other, more practical books to achieve the kind of change you want. I recommend "How to Be, Do, or Have Anything" by Boldt (which is much more practical than the title lets on), "Overachievement" by Eliot and "Getting Things Done" by Allen. 

This book is also good for dipping into from time to time for a little burst of energy. If you want to wring every last drop of life out of your time on earth, I recommend you put this one on your bookshelf.
