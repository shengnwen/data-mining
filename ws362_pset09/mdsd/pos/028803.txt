I have Vogue Knitting and it is indispensable. However, Crompton's 'Bible' is another handy book to have in your library. I personally found the projects, quick, cute and doable. I think the photos and illustrations are enormously helpful and detailed. I agree with another reviewer who disagrees that it is, in fact, a "Bible," but it has proven very practical to have on hand. It's a good second book of techniques to have in your knitting library
