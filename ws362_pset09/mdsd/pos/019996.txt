I love this book. I am a hopeless romantic and I read this book because it is a classic, but I thought it would be boring. I was so wrong. The love in this book is so good! I love how Mr. Rochester is so witty -he is so smart and i don't know, his wittiness just makes him really attractive. I love it how he is a bit out there and he is always asking for her hand, he shows simple ways that he wants Jane. I love how he was trying to make her jealous, I don't know why I just like it! I love how he treats her when they are together, like she is so precious to him. The way he explains his love, I just want to swoon and have someone say these things to me. He is a bit odd though, but it suited him. There were such funny moments between them also! Even though he is not described as handsome, It doesn't matter- the affection he feels for her is just beautiful, something which is hard to find. But he has a secret and things happen....I have read many romantic books and this is my all time favorite even though this isnt really classified as romance. This book doesn't have things that a romance book has like shagging scenes. That makes it all the better because the dialoge is so good that you don't need scenes like that. I love when the characters in a book really get to know eachother before they fall in love and in many romance books you won't find that. I take out this book almost every week to reread what I feel are the good parts; I look foward to doing that in free time that is how good it is. I don't know what your tastes are in books but this book is as good as it gets for me. There are times where it does get a bit slow, but I just love to read the bits with Jane and Mr. Rochester; they just make the book. I love the scene where she is leaving and he asks her about money; it is very funny.
