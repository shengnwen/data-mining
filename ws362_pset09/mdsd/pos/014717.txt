Bishop Wright has done it again. I have read several volumes on the apostle Paul, and I have to conclude that this one by NT Wright is among the top three.

Bishop Wright's knowledge of the OT and how it is echoed in the writings of the great apostle is second to none. Read this piece and enjoy it.

Brilliant, once again
