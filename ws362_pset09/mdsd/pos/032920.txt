The Dolls' House is a very lovely, but adventurous book written for little girls from ages 6 through 10.  The author, Rumer Godden does a remarkable job of narrating and explaining the time period of England and uses great detail to make the young readers feel part of the story.  A family of mixed matched dolls is owned by two sisters living in England in the 1940's.  The children's imagination and creativity bring the dolls to life in the story, but the dolls seem to come alive by themselves, too.  The dolls are unhappy with their current living arrangements and are thrilled to receive a new, but very old doll house.  Many life lessons and relations are learned and tested by the dolls and the children as they try to make the house a home.  The children and the dolls restore the dolls' house in the end, but not without sacrifice.
