	This book is written by two progressive authors with a report card on different subjects for President Bush who advocated NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND.  The subjects affect all Americans in economics, environment, civil liberty, healthcare and education.  Despite his grades, he managed to have White House lease extended for four more years.  That must be democracy and politics.

	This book showed George came from the right wing with a prayer to serve the trinity of religious right, corporate business and neocons.  George is a tough cowboy not to mess with.  He shows America is no paper tiger to the Axis of evil.  His top gun Mission Accomplished show was impressive after the shock and awe.

	As Commander in Chief, George's policy affects rich & poor, faithful & secular, war & peace.  This book helps you decide on the bumper sticker MY SON IN THE WHITE HOUSE DOES NOT DO HIS HOMEWORK IS AN HONOR STUDENT.
