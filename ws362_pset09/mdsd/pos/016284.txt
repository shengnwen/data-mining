This novel is really touching and quite true to the reality that immigrants and children of immigrants from any nationality have to face. The author reveals the hardships of living apart from our closest family members, missing birthdays and deaths alike, and at the same time celebrates that "only in America" feeling: the chance for a better life for our children, the perceived acceptance of our differences in culture, religious beliefs and looks. She writes in a very pleasant manner, and the story never gets stale. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I think that the scriptwriter was up for a big challenge. Totally recommend it
