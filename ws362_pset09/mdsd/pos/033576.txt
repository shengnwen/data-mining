It is very important to remember a golden age in which a greater harmony and balance among man and nature existed.  It is not idealistic to picture such a world but to realize that we are on the edge of creating a planet, in which its inhabitants are at peace with one another.  Yes, Lemuria did physically exist once somewhere in the pacific basin and like all other civilizations it had a period of birth, growth, and a period of demise-everything evolves in cycles.  I would recommend this book very highly to everyone who understands that we can return to the golden age that was Lemuria, and what it represented, at its peak.
