The kanji is fairly easy to find, there is an informational preface. The most commonly used kanji is in the front. A very, very small list of Kanji by English words. I recommend this for a student learning kanji. Numbers, days, etc. are not in order, but easy to spot if there is previous knowledge of kanji. Not recommended for students who've not had previous knowledge of kanji
