There's an old saying that what you don't know can't hurt you. Unfortunately, it is one of the worst falsehoods ever written or spoken in any language. Even in everyday life, what you don't know can kill you. It happens all the time. When the Great Tribulation begins, what you don't know could cost you your salvation. 

What too many Christians don't know is how Islam fits into Second Coming Prophecy. This is the topic that Michael Fortner addresses in his short but excellent book. He has done his homework. As a writer who has researched and written on the same topic, I can assure you that everything he says about the history, practices, and goals of Islam is true.

What Michael Fortner says may shock many people. Muslims will deny it, and many Christians won't believe it. But trust me, Christians need to know what is said in "The Scarlet Beast". It is more than worth the time and money. Read it
