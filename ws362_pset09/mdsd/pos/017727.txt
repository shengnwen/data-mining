I've been reading Nora Roberts for years, ever since she started out writing contemporary romances for the Silhouette line. I always loved her great sense of humor in those books. "Dance Upon the Air" is more serious. It deals with a very serious subject, that of domestic abuse. It also deals with magick and spells. I loved all three of the witches...Mia, Ripley and Nell. And wow, what a hero Zack is. I can hardly wait to read the next two books in the trilogy
