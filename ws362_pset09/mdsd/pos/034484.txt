I reviewed a previous edition about a year ago.  It was pretty good, but I thought some of the degunking advice/suggestions/techniques were a bit odd.  I gave the book to a non-technical family member, who loved it.  She passed it on to another family member who also loved it.  I lost track of it after that. 

So, looking at the book through a non-technical lens, this is a great book to help keep your Mac up and running smoothly.  There is lots of good advice around the various features and applications you would normally use.  For example; How to keep email spam to a minimum; How to find extra disk space if you're running low; How to keep the Dashboard cleaned up.  This book also serves as a great way to explore and understand the various features provided by your Mac and the included applications.  It also suggests quite a few 3rd party applications (free or relatively inexpensive) to assist you with the "degunking" tasks.

I guess to sum it up; this isn't exactly for the Slashdot crowd.  However, if you're a new Mac user, a home user, or a non-technical user (i.e. no one politely refers to you as a computer geek) this should at least be on your "flip-through-it-at-the-book-store" list.  For me, I will be sending it off to a family member.  Based on prior experience, they're going to love it
