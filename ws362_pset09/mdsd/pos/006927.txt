This is my favorite Michaels' book.  The creepy old house, the mystery surrounding the old woman and her maliciousness, the ruined love affair rekindled, and the archaeological dig combine to make a great story.  A reader who reviewed this book was disappointed that the ending was left up in the air; it was the perfect ending in my opinion - it literally sent chills down my spine
