"Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, & the Deadliest Hurricane in History," Erik Larson, NY, Vintage, 2000  ISBN: 0-375-70827-8, SC, 323/273 pgs., Notes 31 pgs., 7 pg. Biblio, 7 pg. Index, 8" x 5 1/8"

This is author Larson's 3rd. of 4 books, & herein he writes with meticulous stype a chronicle of America's most devastating storm, the Galveston 1900 hurricane that caused over 8,000 deaths.  Well-researched, based on archived materials, he inserts masterful fluent prose as he recounts the Galveston affair from viewpoint of resident U.S. Weather Bureau meteorologist, Isaac Cline (& family), of an unrecognized storm which defied existing rules & pounced upon a busy, bustling city totally unprepared for its near-total devastation: - a storm born, perhaps, of "non-linear dynamics."

The jerky writing manner, at times appearing non sequitur,  actually embellishes his story-telling style.  It orchestrates fervid glimpses of erratic events registering splashes of waves, rising tides, salvos of destructive winds all causing dwellings to be torn & made topsy-turvy & then submerged whilst families within sought sanctuary in crowed upper rooms knocked asunder, wtih peoples, pets, animals including toad-frogs, snakes all engulfed in rising waters amidst surf & cyclonic winds during an otherwise not too unusual, hot-humid Saturday afternoon.

The reader gains considerable insight into those forces of Nature which make up a storm & of the reliance people have come to place upon weather forecasting.  Whichever way, "Isaac's Storm" or "Isaac's blunder", it's an excellent read
