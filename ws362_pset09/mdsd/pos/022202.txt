Since the movie is coming out soon, titled "Shooter" instead of the novel's name, I thought I'd read this book. I've seen this author's name and novels for over a decade, but for some unexplicable reason, never tried them.

My bad.

Stephen Hunter is an extraordinary writer. Point of Impact proves it.

It has everything a classic novel of this type has. Even though I loved this book, and know the movie will not be nearly as good, I will still see the movie and have purchased four more of this author's novels. 

It is too bad that this novel could be made into a better television mini-series to do it justice. That's what it would need to tell the full story.

But if you haven't tried a Hunter novel, this is a great place to start. Highly entertaining
