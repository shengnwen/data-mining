Fast-paced story with a nice twist on the "Stranger in a Strange Land" theme.  Interesting characters from various myth and folktales (though don't let Jack Frost and Co. hear you refer to them as such!).

Some of the questions I was left with are:

1) Just how do all these mythic beings manage to get along to get things done?

2) What, precisely is the difference here between a god, demon or just vaguely magical being?

3) If the hunters are such a threat, why doesn't some god or group of gods take them out first?

I know, I know, I think too much, I should just enjoy the story
