As I've long known, the idea that American media has an overall left slant is more than a myth. It's a calculated lie.  I was glad that someone else had noticed this- I thought maybe everyone was reading other newspapers and watching different TV news programs.  Franken made me a feel a little saner.  After I read "Lies and ..." I saught out some of his other work.  I've always been disgusted at Rush, but I figured that it was obvious that Rush was very close to evil, most definately sick and un-American and a teller of lies unlike America has seen before.  So with a similar reluctance to read this book as I had with "Lies and ..." I plunged in.  I'm not going to say what other reviews have said, but like Franken's later books, it is a brilliant expose on the sick right.  I don't like to say "religious right," because people like Ann Coulter, Rush, etc use the well-meaning (if sometimes misguided) Christian religion of regular Americans as a tool, as a way to manipulate them into swallowing whatever lie they's pushing that week.  The right's tactics have improved quite a bit since this book, but it is still an interesting look at them during the era of Clinton
