We like the basic structure of these guidebooks.  They boil all the information down into short paragraphs that detail the driving directions, degree of difficulty, mileage, trail highlights, dangers, in short just what you want to know before heading out.  This is their newest and we've just used it and can say with confidence it did the job it promised. We saved Honolulu and Pearl Harbor for last when we wanted down time.  For preparing for our vacations to Maui and Oahu, these books have been most valuable
