I liked this book a lot, and it helped clear up some questions I had about feeding my baby for the first time and after. I like the idea of making my own food, but in reality, I doubt I'll do it much. It's a whole lot easier to buy organic baby food (although I do try to find it on sale so I don't have to pay more) then to make food all of the time. In the life of a busy family, making the adult's dinner is hard enough! She has some terrific ideas about food, parties, health, etc. and I will use quite a bit of what I learned.
