This is a compilation of little-known or overlooked stories from American history, many of which are fascinating.  I was intrigued to learn, for instance, that the Boston Tea Party took place because English tea was too cheap, not too expensive as I had always believed.   It is fascinating too to learn about the forgotten Fourteenth State, the Communist Invasion of Texas, Bet Freeman'as Walk to Freedom, and many other fascinating episodes of which I knew nothing.  His piece about Benjamin Franklin is a bit selective, he admires Franklin very much and therefore says nothing about Franklin's disgraceful and barbaric treatment of his son, who, unlike his traitorous father, was loyal to the British crown.  Some of the information is simply annoying.  I do not wish to be told that Pocahontas did not save John Smith's life, that Betsy Ross didn't make the first American flag, and that Belle Starr was just a sad old drunk instead of a dashing outlaw.  And |I don'tbelieve Pocahontas was murdered, that's simply silly.  In spite of these dubious passages, this is an intersting and enjoyable book
