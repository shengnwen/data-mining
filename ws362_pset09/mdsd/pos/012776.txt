Peter Robinson's "Close to Home" is a gem...one sensational read. Reading it is like watching an exquisite ballplayer at work...he makes the writing look so easy that only a thoughtful examination will clue you in as to how ingenious the writing is.

Chief Inspector Alan Banks is called home from vacation when a body dumped in 1965 is unearthed. Turns out the body is that of Graham Marshall, a boyhood pal of CI Banks. 

In his own district, Banks is investigating a missing person, turned kidnapping, turned homicide. The victim is a teenager, about the same age as was Graham Marshall when he disappeared.

"They were linked in his mind in some odd way. Not technically, of course. But two very different boys from very different times had ended up dead before their time, and both had died violently."

Banks has able assistants in both cases: Michelle Hart in the Marshall case and Annie Cabbot on the current case. 

The police procedural on both matters is detailed, captivating and all three detectives have an instinct for crime solving.

Banks is a keen observer of humanity and a man of integrity...a marvelous protagonist. In each case the whydunit will uncover whodunit.

I plan to go back and read the entire series. This is the first British mystery that has grabbed my attention in forever. 

The pages absolutely glided by.
