I have read all of James Lee Burke's books and he is a very good crime writer. He has the ability to make the reader feel what living in the deep south of the USA would be and even better, he makes us feel the characters that are described.

In this book, Dave Robicheaux is on the case of a serial killer combined with the search for a long-lost acquaintance who may or may not have been murdered.

Without wishing to give away any major plots, I can say that the saying "It is not the end that counts but the journey" is validated in this book with the ending very so-so but the journey is well worth your time.
