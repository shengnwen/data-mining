This is the first CD I purchased that helped me to understand what was going on in my own mind.  It has a little humor, a little bit of science and the other side reality.  A little hard to hear at times because it is an open discussion but well worth listening to if you have ever experienced a coincidence of any sort.  I now expect coincidences everyday with a deeper understanding of staying connected to source all the time
