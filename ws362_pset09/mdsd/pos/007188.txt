...when I reviewed the film, I said I'd never go to sea in anything smaller than a "Nimitz"-class carrier, or alternatively a submarine. Now I've read the book, forget the carrier, submarine only, I want something that goes under all THAT weather. 

To me, book and film complement each other very nicely. The book lacks the excitement of the film, but explains much that the film cannot (the backgrounds of the characters, the nature of storms, some varied history of fishing, previous storms, etc., and even the physiology of drowning). The film, on the other hand, puts a face (imaginary) on the crew of the "Andrea Gail" and what happened to them in a way that the book can't. Some aspects of the various attempted rescues depicted in the book are changed in the film, but not in a way that in any way diminishes the skill and heroism of the Coastguard and Air National Guard personnel who put their necks on the line in unbelievable conditions to save mariners in distress. If anything, they are the co-stars of both book and film, along with the storm itself. 

The book is slow to get going and is written in the present tense, which I find irritating, but once it gets rolling, it gets you in. If you've seen the film and enjoyed it, your experience is not complete until you've read the book.
