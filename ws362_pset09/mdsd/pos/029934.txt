Great piece on the food revolution in America. Loved the history and it was just enough gossipy to keep me from putting it down. I would compare it to 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' in what it showed how the home computer got started, to how we became a nation of foodies. A movie version would be great or a documentry. This book was long overdue. Now we can see some history behind all those cookbooks we have been inundated with for so many years
