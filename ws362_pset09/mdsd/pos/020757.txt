The Hunt for Red October, an amazing novel by Tom Clancy, is an action packed adventure of political controversy and suspenseful combat.  The Red October, the Soviet Union's newest submarine, sets sail in the frozen Arctic circle.  Ramius, the captain of the Red October sees this as an opportunity to take revenge for the avoidable death of his wife; His plan is to defect to the United States.  Will he make it, or will the Soviets catch him before he can give the Americans what they need to stay ahead of the Soviets in race for the ultimate submarine?

This novel was a pleasure to read, and I recommend it to all ages, although there is some inappropriate language for younger readers.  It never slows down, and you'll find yourself staying up late at night, unable to put it down.  This novel is almost frighteningly realistic, making the story even more convincing and entertaining.  There is a reason that this is a bestseller; The Hunt for Red October sets up a race that will leave you breathless as you read from start to end.

The main difference in this novel that stands out in my mind is that Ramius' motive is exposed almost immediately; there is no secret motivation.  Once that is put aside, the reader is able to concentrate on the true question: will Ramius be successful?  This allows to the reader to digest each chapter and add to the knowledge that they previously receive to attempt to predict the outcome.  As each character introduced becomes to interact with the others, Ramius and his crew's goal is obstructed, and they have to make twists and turns in order to proceed with their plan.  This method of writing is one of Clancy's unique ways to tell the same story in a more interesting way.
