Sorry the other reviewer didn't like this, but as an FDA employee when Reagan would not allow the regulation of unpasturized cheese, where the listeria bacteria consumed in it caused the deaths of dozens of babies and pregnant women (pro-life?), I have to agree with the author.  That cheese example is just the beginning; it doesn't include the dozens children who died after it was clear that aspirin use in children with fever caused the deadly Reye syndrome and the administration refused to allow FDA to put warning instructions on the label.  It does not include the dozens of children who were poisoned by pills in easy-opening containers (iron pills look like candy and overdoses not treated promptly are irreversibly fatal). This book does name courageous industry people as well as public servants. It can open your eyes to the critical role the government played in assuring the availability of penicillin during WWII and vaccines today. It is the history of germs and cures in the US in a plain-spoken format.  However, if Karl Rove is your hero and you've forgotten about Iran Contra, guns for hostages, ketchup as a vegetable in school lunches, a recommendation to wear hats for global warming, and how much you paid for the savings and loan scandals (over $1 TRILLION according to conservative estimates) ... have I left anything out?... then your neo-con heart will surely break
