This book breaks things down for easy use trail planning, including extra excursions and were to camp on both overnight an longer trips .  It even gives you info on each camp site.  complaint: sometimes the maps are not next to trail you are reading about but next to another trail in the area. All of the campsites on my topo map are not in the book map although they are described in the back
