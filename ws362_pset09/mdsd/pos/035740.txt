If you really believe that you have to be born rich or that the rich have some special benefits unavailable to you or I, think again. Brian Tracy is a perfect example. Here is a man who started off dead broke, dropped out of high school, had no skills to speak off and still achieved incredible success.

Brian Tracy started off as a dishwasher! Then he went on to straight commission door to door sales barely getting by. And Brian Tracy is the first to tell you that if he could do it, so can you.

In this book, Tracy moves away from his usual sales and motivation and into wealth building. You will learn about precious metals and other investments. You will learn how to use Brians 100 homes strategy to become a successful real estate investor. You will learn how to profitably and successfully start your own business. You will learn how to use the internet. Brian even explains how a retarded boy could become a millionaire by simply investing in savings bonds.

My favorite chapter is chapter 4-How To Start With Nothing. I let my son read this chapter and he quickly devoured the rest of the book as well. He is now exploring his options when he graduates in 2006. 

Geting Rich Your Own Way is probably the best wealth book since Charles Givens wrote Wealth Without Risk and Financial Self DeFense. There is something for everybody in here. Perhaps Brians best book to date. Also recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad and Cash Flow Quadrant by Robert Kiyosaki
