This book means so much to me.  When I was little I use to carry it around even though I really couldn't hold it.  It use to drag the ground. I would  lay on my father's chest every night as he read it to me.  My nickname to  this day from him is Mouse.  Because I am my daddy's mouse.  When I got  married he gave the book to me as a wedding present.  Of course not the  same copy as that one was lost in our many moves, but he searched all over  for a copy of it for me.  It is a wonderful book and I plan to read it to  my kids
