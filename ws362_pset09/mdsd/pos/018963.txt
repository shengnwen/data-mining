Like all of Larson's work, this one takes the reader on a long walk. The stories Larson connects are one of England's most infamous domestic murders and the introduction of wireless communication by Marconi.

But, in Larson's way, he revels in the stories behind these stories. Sometimes to the reader's distraction, and often at the expense of what is ostensibly the main story, Larson digresses (clearly to his own delight) into minutiae of geographical history, exploration of quizzical coincidence, and analysis of every theological, sexual, political and cultural (down to history of denominations of currency) touchpoint interfacing with his subjects.

Obviously Larson sees these corrolaries as elements of his larger story, and in many ways the addendums do add to the overall effect of the book - that is a feeling that Larson is taking you there. 

Without question, the book is very good but it can feel a mile wide and an inch deep at times, and consequently can leave you wondering if the somewhat obscure topics that Larson chooses haven't remained obscure precisely because they don't merit 400 pages.

You would expect the depth represented here - and more - from a Marconi bio, but this book doesn't serve that purpose, and the murder story is little more than what it ever was: a gory front-page true crime tale for the British tabloids. 

His fascination with early-20th century science, business and society is evident and the work is admittedly inspired and well-done (i.e., Isaac's Storm, Devil in the White City), but a contemporary American reader without a shared fascination for the era can't help but feel that the books he has written in that idiom feel a little out of their time and place.

I like the book, I just hope that someday Larson will train his lens on an event or person that rises to the thoroughly researched and expertly written treatment that he always provides
