At first I was disappointed that this seemed like another drug/supplement book. I thought I had already tried every combination and failed. But then I read this book and for the first realized how my allergy medication was making me fat. That was the first thing to go. Then I realized I hadn't tried one of the supplements and it was at the center of one of my other problems that contributed to my weight issues. Once I started taking them, I lost 2 lbs in 4 days. I lost my desire to "stuff" myself, and I also was free from an addiction I've had and fought for many years. My brain is finally doing what I want it to do. Thank you Dr. Rivas
