That Nemirovsky died in Auschwitz before she could finish this novel is yet another shame to lay at the feet of the Nazis, but the books that survive are wonderful:  stories told with grace, elegance, tenderness, and a wry humor for human foibles.  This is imperative war fiction, highly recommended for readers who loved Anita Shreve's RESISTANCE and Jenna Blum's THOSE WHO SAVE US
