After reading Bitten, I was quite hooked on the werewolf characters. This book was a great follow up. I was a little disappointed that there was no Antonio or Nick, but you still get a heavy dose of Elena, Clay and Jeremy. Plus a whole new lot of supernatural characters that Armstrong uses for the following books. Great story and interesting characters! Totally loved it
