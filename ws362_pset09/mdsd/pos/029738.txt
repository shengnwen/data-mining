I enjoyed reading the book.  It was written after a detailed investigation about the religion of Islam and how God's revelations were interpreted over many centuries. It is clear from that book that Islam does not dictate the Arabic customs as the principles of Islam. God's ayets about women should be carefully read and interpreted, as this book has explained so.  I see this book as a valuable contribution to humanity
