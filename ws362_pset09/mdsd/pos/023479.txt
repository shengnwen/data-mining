Let me say at the outset that Lenny Henry does a marvelous job as the narrator. His English accent is delightful, his voice loud and clear, the impersonation of the different characters a delight as well. I always find a bit awkward male narrators' imitations of women's voices, but this is not a big deal. 

Overall, I think this is a bright audio version of a good but not great book. I definitely enjoyed much more some other of Gaiman's stories (for instance Coraline, and especially the first of the "Two Plays for Voices", which is pure genius). The characters are funny, but I didn't find any of them particularly lovable. I did not care too much about what would happen to them one way or another. 

There are a few moment of great story-telling in this book, but not many. Overall, definitely worth listening to (even if it's very long), but I don't think I will listen it again for at least for a very long while
