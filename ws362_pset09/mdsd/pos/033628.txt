I am quite happy with my purchase of this book and Eric Tyson has done a good job at giving us some very interesting alternatives.
However, I'd like to recommend that you also pick up a copy of Untapped Wealth Discovered by Jeff Marquis & Kerry Harrison.
This book gives us a fresh new approach to realism, has suggestions for reducing costs and increasing revenues, and has an eye for booming markets.
Hats off though to Mr Tyson
