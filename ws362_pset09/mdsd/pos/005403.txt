I am, quite simply, obsessed with this book. -- I haven't read anything that has captivated me this much in years.  It is wonderfully transporting, emotionally gripping and intellectually provocative.  In short, it's got everything.  I had not read this author before, but clearly he is a literary force to be reckoned with. -- The guy knows (or manages to research) a tremendous amount about all matters of life.  The plot touches on romantic love, crime, addiction, health, business, parenthood, the law, . . . you name it.  The characters have occupied my imagination constantly since I finished the novel.  Truly, this is an impressive and endlessly gratifying read.  Do not miss out on the experience
