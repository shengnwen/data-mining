Don't let other serious students steer you away from this book just because it's not a textbook; phrase books have their place for serious students also.  I have learned both from phrase books for weguksaram's and from phrase books for Koreans.

Unless you are more kind-hearted than I am, you might be especially interested in Chapter 9, "Curses and Insults."  That had some words and phrases which I have been unable to find in the dictionary.  I even made a special computer file so that I could study those words and phrases.

To read the book through once takes only a couple of hours.  Still, it's worth the price
