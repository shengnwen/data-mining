It's been a while for me since I read this one, but one impression clearly stuck, happy bright childhood in the 1950's and, yes, baseball.

It was overall well written memoir, very optimistic, full of childhood memories of a neighborhoodly and cozy streets and people. 
I think that besides being a well written woman's memoir a baseball fan should find the book to be a treat as well
