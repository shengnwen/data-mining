As a beginning student of philosophy, I had to take my time with this book and read it carefully.  Prof. Vlastos writes very clearly and makes his arguments step by step so that there is no mistaking his point, which you are then able to judge for yourself.  He is persuasive, not dogmatic, but you have to be able to follow his train of reasoning.

In my opinion, it is unfair to accuse Prof. Vlastos of "special pleading", that is, presenting only evidence that supports his own arguments.  Vlastos spent his life studying Socrates, and no doubt developed strong feelings for the object of his study, but it seems to me that he goes to great lengths to acknowledge evidence contradicting his own conclusions.  But Vlastos makes his points very thoroughly, so if you want to quibble with him you have to have your own ducks in a row.

Vlastos covers the following topics:

     -  Socratic Irony.
     -  The "Socratic problem" - what we can know about Socrates as an actual historical figure, as opposed to the various impressions handed down to us by Aristophanes, Plato, Xenophon, and others.
     -  The shift from the Socratic method ("elenchus") to mathematics in Plato's middle dialogues.
     -  Does Socrates cheat?  (Yes, but only in jest.)
     -  Socrates' religious beliefs.  (He believed in his "daimonion", but was not a mystic.)
     -  Socrates' rejection of the "lex talionis".  (I found this to be by far the most interesting chapter, Socrates articulating the "Golden Rule" 400 years before Christ.)
     -  An explication of Socrates' theory that Happiness and Virtue are identical.

Vlastos concludes that Socrates, believing what he believed, died a happy man.

Anyone interested in philosophy will benefit from spending a few hours with Professor Gregory Vlastos and his friend, Socrates.
