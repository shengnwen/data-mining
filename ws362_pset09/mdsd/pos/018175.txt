Dawn is the new member of the Baby Sitters Club. She's Mary Anne's best friend. There are five members, Kristy Thomas, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, Mary Anne Spier, and Dawn Scafer. Dawn gets to baby sit some new kids: Suzi, Buddy, and Marnie Barrett. I don't understand why it's called "Dawn and the Impossible Three," the kids aren't that bad, and Dawn really likes them! But their mom never says anything about the kids to Dawn, and she even leaves the wrong phone number and doesn't say that Marnie is allergic to chocalate, and Dawn almost gives her a brownie! Mrs. Barrett does say don't let the kids talk to their dad on the phone, but then Buddy does, and he goes outside while Dawn is dressing Suzi and Marnie and then Dawn can't find him when she goes outside to play with the kids
