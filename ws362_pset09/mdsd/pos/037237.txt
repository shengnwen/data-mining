Whitehead is one of the best authors writing today. His prose is sharp and engaging. It is hard to find a non-commerical book that holds the reader's attention like this novel. I just happentd to stumble across this novel amongst the piles of crap at Barnes and Noble. If you like Whitehead, try Zadie Smith's "White Teeth" or Travis Craig's "99 City", two other author's who I just happened to stumble upon and love
