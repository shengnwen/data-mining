I found tihs book very intriguing especially with the multiple themes that were repeatedly used throughout the book.  The most important theme I discovered was the faint line between reality and imagination.  Constantly, this line is blurred as the attendants and nurses at the mental institution turn perfectly normal and sane patients into the insane.  Particularly Nurse Ratched, she carries reality in her viewpoint and intends to change whatever she imagines in her mind into reality.  Furthermore, the overbearing dominance of Nurse Rathched also emphasizes the importance of females in this book.  The females in this book tend to carry a very strong presence among the males and belittle them to the point where they become extremely insecure about their sexuality.  Constantly, new themes are brought up throughout the book, which is what I find most interesting. Themes lead to more themes, which leads to even more themes and all together the motifs create a fantastic book that I highly recommend
