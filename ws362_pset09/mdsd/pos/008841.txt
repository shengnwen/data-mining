Let me start by saying I really liked this book. The stories are great and I actually did use this to explore the old and new jazz sites when I was in Paris last week. The only reason I'm not giving it the final star is because I would have preferred a paperback version: it's easier to carry and I don't feel bad about marking the book up or folding down pages. Please print a cheaper paperback version
