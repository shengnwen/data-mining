I love this book, and have already reccomended it to my Mother and a few good friends.  I bought this book for my 12 year old son, but am afraid that it will be too difficult for him to read.  The book consists of speeches, letters and articles written by our founding fathers and mothers with a brief commentary by William Bennett.  I have to admit that I have a dictionary by my bed to look up words that I don't know, and there are MANY.  Our Founders wrote eloquently, but it is sometimes hard to follow.  The messages that our founders were conveying in their correspondences are relevent today.  I have been inspired to be more industrious and work on my other faults
