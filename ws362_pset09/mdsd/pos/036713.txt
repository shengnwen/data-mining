This book illustrates many beautiful ideas through photographs of paper models with concise commentary. First the regular polyhedra, of course, followed by variations of the models that brings out their duality and symmetry properties. We also study how the regular polyhedra can be compounded, inscribed in each-other, and pasted together along a common cross-section ("when halves of the Platonic solids having the same cross-sections come together, monsters are born"). We also study truncating the regular polyhedra to obtain the semi-regular polyhedra, stellating to obtain non-convex regular solids, and faceting to obtain non-convex semi-regular polyhedra. There is a deplorably short but somewhat useful section with practical advice on building models. "Suitable cardboard is of the sort used for mounting photographs, and suitable glue is a 'white glue' of the sort exemplified by 'Elmer's Glue-all' ... For several hours the joints remain sufficiently flexible to permit adjustment of the dihedral angle". It's a pity that we are advised to construct the sides of the regular polyhedra by unromantic means; equilateral triangles are to be made using "a draftsman's 30-60-90 triangle" and the construction of a regular pentagon "requires a guide made of heavier cardboard, such as an illustration board, with two edges meeting at the desired angle"---obviously you will want to construct the faces using ruler-and-compass constructions
