I love this book so much the Public Library told me to purchase my own  copy - I check it out at least once a month!  I am from NYC and this book  is soooooo NYC.  I feel like I know Betty and Bergorf Goodman dept store.   Great, excellent, terrific advice on closets, storage and clothing care.   Also how to mix all your black clothes with other items instead of wearing  fashion-editor uniform.  I am going to buy 3 copies today!!
