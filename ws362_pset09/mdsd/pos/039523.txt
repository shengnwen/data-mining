We recently visited Molokai and rode Roy Horner's mules down to the Colony at Kalaupapa. The Colony gives an excellent account of how Hawaii and the (then) Lepers interacted. It also traces the life of Father Damien in a well-written, descriptive fashion. The Colony brings Kalaupapa to life and makes your visit to the actual colony and meaningful and unforgettable event. We higly recommend it!
