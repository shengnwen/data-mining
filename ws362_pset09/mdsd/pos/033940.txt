Captain From Castile is my all time favorite book. I have read Samuel Shellabarger's other novels and enjoyed them also, but "Captain" remains my favorite. When my husband (without my knowledge)stored the box with my hardbond issue in a storage unit when we moved, where it ended up getting ruined I was very upset. I have had to be content with the paperback version. I recently thought I was going to be able to purchase a new issue version, but could not get it afterall. Hopefully, it will be re-published and perhaps the full book be made into a movie as the one previously did not deal completely or well with the true contents of the story. Its a marvelous read of a period of history full of details that are wonderful and sad and delightful to read and re-read. I have been doing so since 1964.
