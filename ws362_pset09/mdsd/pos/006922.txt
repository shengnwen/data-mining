They got it down. It's a sixteen week course, providing you are up to speed with the preliminary 11 week training program.(That's the ablility to jog 30 minutes - 4 times a week) I am on my last long run this weekend of week#13 at 18 miles (the first long run was 5 in week 1)and then the last 3 weeks before the marathon is all tapering back. I am confident, and have not a doubt that I am, by this time, a marathoner, and will finish. That is the goal emphasized by the book, and that will be fine by me ...(this time..)!
