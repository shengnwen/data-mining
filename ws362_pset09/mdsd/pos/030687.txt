This is the 1st book i read twice...... which was like 10 months afta i had read it originally. Even though I only read it(a second time) cos' I had nothing better to do...(couldn't move much cos I stacked it pretty bad off my Skateboard)but man it was just as good this time....I couldn't remember everything that happened which was good. But remember ppl Laymon is KING and king is LAY
