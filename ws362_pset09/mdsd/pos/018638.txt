Althought this is a good book, I would not recommend it as a primary purchase (try &quot;Wine for Dummies&quot; or &quot;Windows on the World Complete Wine Course&quot;) nor as a secondary purchase (try &quot;Wine Bible&quot; or &quot;Oxford Companion to Wine&quot;), but I would recommend it as a tertiary purchase. There is a decent amount of material presented in a professional and eye-pleasing manner. Be forewarned that the book is large (9&quot;x11&quot;) and heavy -- probably not something you would read in bed. The coverage of the different areas is pretty good, but not exceptional, hence my four-star rating
