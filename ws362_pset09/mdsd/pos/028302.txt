I've been writing for years and earned my MFA a few years ago and have loved "What If" since it was introduced to me in my intro to creative writing class.  It's great for beginners to exercise their creativity, fun for people with more writing experience because the assignments allow for creative expansion as well as improvement and various method training, and if I'm ever having a down time when I just don't know what to write but feel the need to get something on paper, the book is perfect inspiration, and sometimes has the tendency to get me started on a story I didn't know I had in me.  Even if it seems elementary, it's hardly that...each exercise can be done once yearly, and every time it's done it will be tackled differently and with growing talent and skill
