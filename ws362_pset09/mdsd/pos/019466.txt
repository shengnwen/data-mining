I read this story at least twice as a child and I still remember how much the book impacted me.  Many children never get the opportunity to actually get to "know" the characters in a book and this book provides an excellent opportunity.  The situations are real, the characters are real, the emotions are real and the reader leaves this story feeling as if they themselves have lost a loved one.  This is an excellent read that I would DEFINITELY recommend to anyone
