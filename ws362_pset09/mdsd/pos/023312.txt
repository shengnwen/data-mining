Like most other readers, I purchased this book on the strength of Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers and the popular HBO series of the same name. So when I saw that Winters was publishing his memoirs, I knew that I'd get around to reading it sooner or later.

Beyond Band of Brothers is a fine war memoir. Winters tells his story in the same quiet manner with which he conducts his interviews. We see how he saw things back as the CO of Easy Company and eventually, the 2nd Battalion.

If you've read Band of Brothers or Larry Alexander's biography of Winters, then you don't necessarily have to read this. It is though, well written and modest. Readers who want blood thirsty passages and macho chest thumping will scour this book in vain. What the reader will get is a (again) modest treatise on leadership and Winters' admiration of the men he fought beside.

Beyond Band of Brothers isn't the best war memoir I've read, but the fact that it's an easy read and moves quickly is a good thing.

If I have any problem with the book, it's...well, the title. I understand that you have to use the tag "Band of Brothers" somewhere for the average person who has heard of the series or book to take notice. I think that maybe, "Easy Company: The Real Story behind 'Band of Brothers,'" while admittedly awkward would have been a better choice. That way, Mr. Winters book will either succeed or fail on it's own merits. It's a very minor thing, but one that won't lessen the reader's enjoyment of a story of a man from a rapidly disappearing generation
