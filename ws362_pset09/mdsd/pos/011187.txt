Nelson's text is a welcome addition to the offerings available on gender and nonverbal communication. Where many publications are either too academic and dry or purely anecdotal and lacking in empirical support, Nelson offers a rich middle ground. I have been teaching nonverbal communication at the college level for the past few years and am thrilled to offer my students an accessible, practical and fascinating companion book to their textbook. Nelson's move beyond the descriptive (men do 'y' and women do 'x') to more hands on applications of concepts makes the book a worthwhile investment
