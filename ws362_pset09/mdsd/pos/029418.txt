The book is about what Howard French has witnessed in many part of Africa during some 20 years. Crisis are told not from a condescending "above", we-the-nice-NGO-have-seen-such-misery, and this is a rare trait in such books. 

The book is mainly about the rise of dictatorship, corruption and civil wars in west africa : liberia, niger, congo-brazzaville and congo/Zaire. A big part of the book is devoted to the second rwanda genocide, this time commited by tutsi army under the cover of Laurent Desir Kabila inside Congo. This event, for whatever reason, has not received the coverage of the big media and French's book is one of the rare place one can find an account of it from a first hand witness.

The book is not soft, neither on corrupt local political leaders, nor on ruthless westerners. However, it always remains emotionnaly involving.
