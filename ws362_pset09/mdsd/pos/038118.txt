This is a very interesting look into the life and mind of Mr. Buffett.  I first read it back in 1997.  I found it interesting (and believe it or not, at times riveting) and very easy to read.

Mr. Lowenstein does a great job of describing the life of Mr. Buffett in a way that illustrates the humor, the complexities, the determination of a man who, to the rest of the world, is perceived as being dry, standoffish, and humorless.  

I just bought a second copy to give as a gift.  I think in the past 10 years there has been alot of happenings in the financial markets that a revision or addendum is warranted.
