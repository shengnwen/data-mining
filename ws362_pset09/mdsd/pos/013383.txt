I came from India to USA to visit my garnd son in Minneapolis.While in Hennepen County libraray I have seen plenty of books and one of these was &quot;HOME REMEDIES&quot; by Michel VanStraten published in 1998. after going through the contents ,to my surprise EUREKA !  I found init ,both  conventional and compemantary medicines for common ailments viz  Allopathy,Homeopathy,Naturopathy,Herbopathy,Aromopathy,Occpressure,Alexanders  Techs,Yoga,and grandmom's home remidie's etc.This gives option to anybody  to go in for any type of medicine within his reach as these medicines  prevent diseases in the initital stage itself.This is a rare goldbin to the  poor and middleclass.Had it contained Magnetic Therpy,CosmicRay therpy,and  Deshanes systems and Unanisystem of Medicines it would be more commen and  universal. However prevention is better than cure I would like to carry  this trusure to India
