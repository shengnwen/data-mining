I'm not sure I understand why this book is rated as low as it is.  As a fan of Salinger, I have read most of the newspaper articles regarding various citings and encounters over the years but there was never a single volume that put it all together.  I found this book to be a smooth, easy read packed with information that I had not previously been exposed to.  I would recommend it highly to anyone with an interest in Salinger and his work
