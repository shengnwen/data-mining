This book is very exciting I learned about how ACE the pig can communicate with his owner.   He has alot of adventures.     I would reccommend this  book to any age I think it would brighten anyone`s day to hear about a big fat pig that made me laugh. It`s a  book that you can`t put down but sometimes you have to .  I would give it five golden stars.  ACE the pig, Nanny the lamb and Megan,are all the people that live on Ted Tubbs Farm.  ACE isn`t an ordinary pig   If you want to find out why, you should read this book
