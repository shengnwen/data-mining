I tried other language CDs and you mostly ended up repeating what was said. They left me wanting to learn more about how verbs are conjugated and why certain words are where they were. This CD fills in all the gaps, explains how the Italian language works and how it compares to English. This gave me a more complete understanding of  how to use the language. Michel Thomas' technique works great too. I felt I was able to expand my ability to speak Italian almost instantly
