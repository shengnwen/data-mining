Generally, I avoid reading memoirs because I find them to be trite and distastefully emotional.  However, Fuller's Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, about the author's experience growing up white in Africa, pleasantly surprised me.  Simple and sincere, Fuller avoids judgment of herself and others as she relates her difficult life with neither sugar-coated poeticism nor the sensationalistic `woe-is-me' attitude one might expect.  She is truthful with herself and with the reader: she does not apologize for her family's racist attitudes, but neither does she justify them.  Likewise, Fuller's unconditional love for her mother underlies her necessarily harsh descriptions of her alcoholic mother's mental instability.  Remarkably, the book interweaves crucial social issues-such as racism and the effects of revolution on all facets of society-with universal, yet gently personal, themes of familial love, self-discovery, and a sense of belonging.  This candid portrait of an extraordinary girl's pains and joys is worth the read.  Thoroughly uplifting, it is fresh and full of life.
