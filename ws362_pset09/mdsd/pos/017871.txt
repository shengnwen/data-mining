I'm hardly a disinterested observer- I've had the financial and spiritual pleasure to be in two mastermind groups with Bill and one with Joe.  However, I can speak first-hand to their knowledge of the subject, and the almost miraculous changes in my life and business that have resulted from my experience with our Mastermind group.

Bill and Joe have put it all in this book.  How to do it, even if you live in the "boonies," how to actually start and run a mastermind group, and how to get the most out of the group- fast.

If you're wondering how to thrive as an entrepreneur, this book is essential reading
