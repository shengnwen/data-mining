In Playful Parenting, Larry Cohen says, "Unlike many personality changes we might like to make, better playing skills can be pretty easily learned." I can confirm that what he says is true.  I wasn't a very playful parent, but since reading Playful Parenting and doing workshops with Larry, I'm becoming a very playful grandparent. To my delight, and the delight of my grandchildren and their friends, I'm become pretty good at connecting through play, roughhousing, and silliness. 

As a parent, a grandparent, a parent educator, and the author of Connection Parenting, Playful Parenting is one of my top favorite parenting books. I recommend Playful Parenting in all my parenting talks and classes and the parents who read it always enthusiastically report wonderful changes in their relationships with their children. 

Reading and practicing Playful Parenting taught me that being playful is one of the most powerful ways we can connect with children. The smiles, giggles, laughter, affection, and connection that bubble up when we are playful with children can change the moment, the day, even our whole relationship with a child. I consider Playful Parenting required reading for all adults who want to connect with the children in their life.

I thank you, Larry, both personally and professionally, for all that I have learned, and now teach, about connecting with children through being more playful.
