This review is for St. Martin's Press first hardback edition published in July 2002, 294 pages.  HOT SIX was on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list for 18 weeks between June 2000 and August 2003, reaching the peak position of number 7.

In this Stephanie Plum episode, Ranger, the mysterious bounty hunter who taught Stephanie the trade, is wanted for questioning in the murder of the son of an infamous arms dealer.  While still gainfully employed nabbing "skips," also known as subplots (and romancing Joe Morelli) Stephanie manages to help Ranger untangle his affairs.

HOT SIX has humorous dialogue, funny pranks and whacky characters.  The scenes with the fugitive Morris Munson are a bit off the sheet, but this ain't literature.  Grandma is featured, as is a mongrel dog with an eating disorder.  Rex the blasï¿½ hamster still turns the wheel.  The bad guys are not scary, the violence and profanity minimal, and the sexual details are left to your imagination.  In short, HOT SIX is quintessential Evanovich.
