I really like this Bible so far.  The quality seems to be excellent.  I compared it to a Thomas Signature Series thinline Bible I have.  The Thomas Signature's leather is much softer (although I have to wait until the ESV loosens up a little) but I like the feel and smell of the ESV.  the print on the ESV is actually slightly easier for me to read.  I did not experience any problems with the pages sticking near the spine.  I think once the ESV leather loosens up a little it will be outstanding.  And I love the ESV version.  This is the Bible that I "read" when I read the Bible. Overall I am impressed with the quality of product and workmanship.
