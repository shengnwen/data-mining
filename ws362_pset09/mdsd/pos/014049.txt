I am a huge fan of the show "Charmed" and basically I like finding merchandise from or about the show.  I am a mad journaler and this book is great.  It is bound nicely, in black, pages aren't lined, very sturdy.  It has a little insert about how to write your spells, which is a bit hoaky, but cute.  And on the spine it says Book of Shadows which thrilled me to no end.  I definitely would recommend this for any writer, journaler sort.
