Gene Callahan accomplishes the monumentally difficult task of taking what seems to be "impossible" to outsiders and makes it accessible through his use of excellent examples and word-pictures.  (I'm sure the logical positivist, mathematics-based economists will despise the rationalist approach...but let's save that discussion for a few beers and a cigar...).

He builds his discussion, bit by bit, working with the average reader.  You don't need to be a pre-PhD to follow what Gene is saying...the old "crawl-walk-run" idea.  The sense I had was this was more of a trip where we would go from stop to stop, discussing the concept, then using that to build to the next concept.  The great thing is that Callahan doesn't patronize his readers...he expects you're going to work a bit.

Overall, despite my many years of reading Austrian economics texts & pamphlets, I found this back-to-basics approach to be very helpful in bringing my thinking down the stairs of the ivory tower & back onto the streets, making economics the true "beer-and-pizza" description of reality it is (P=MC doesn't taste as good anyway!)
