This is the first of the Myron Bolitar books, and as original as you would expect it to be.  Who else would name their main character Myron, even he doesn't like the name.  He spends almost as much time complaining about his name as he does making wisecracks at just about everything else.  

Myron is the ultimate in doing the best you can with what is your godgiven talents.  Originally a basketball wiz in New Jersey and then a national championship winner at Duke, he's drafted by the Celtics but damages a knee at a rookie practice and never plays again.  He joins the FBI, and with his college roomate gets involved in many black-ops that we are never told about (hopefully in some later prequels).  They leave under unexplained reasons and Myron decides to become a sports agent (did I mention he also went to law school).

He's currently negotiating a contract for his first superstar client, an heisman award winning quarterback (Christian Steele, who may have a uncle named Remington and looks like Pierce Brosnan).  One day Christian receives a sleezy magazine with a naked picture of his missing (over one year) cheerleader girlfriend.  Said girlfriend is the little sister of Myron's old squeeze from back in college.

Well the set-up is great, and so is the action, especially trying to follow the smartleck comments and destruction of overmuscled pin-heads and killers.  It's a great ride, so fasten your seat belt and pray the air bag on your side works
