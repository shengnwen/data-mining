I found the information in this book helpful from the very first page. The tips Mr. Clothier shares in his book are very practical and specific, from writing course material to dealing with "difficult" students. Although the print date is almost ten years old, I found the information to be quite relevant even today. I am not certain, however, whether it is worth the $110 price currently listed. I paid $40 used, and I don't regret a penny that I spent. I keep it at my desk and refer to it often as a refresher
