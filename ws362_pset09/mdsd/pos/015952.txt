This book has been my constant companion in the month leading up to and now the week since surgery.  I went into surgery completely at ease, largely thanks to the "walk-through" of what to expect on the day of surgery that's contained in this book.  And after surgery, the recovery information and tips are helping everyday!  I highly recommend this book, if you are facing surgery or need help making the choice that's right for you.
