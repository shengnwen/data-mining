I had a few years break from Sandra Brown's novels nad only recently have reached for them again. The plot is absolutely mesmerizing. On one hand you don't want to put it down from the moment you opened the book for the first time, but on the other you don't want to finish it too quickly, cause you know you'll miss the main characters
