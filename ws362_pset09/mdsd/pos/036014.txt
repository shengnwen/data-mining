This book is a very interesting chronicle and very well written saga of the murders of two women at the hands of their husband at the time, John David Smith. The book, written by one of the victims sister, chronicles the exhaustive search by the victim's family for the answers as to what happened to their beloved sister. It also details how that search ended up helping to resolve a cold case, from the 1970's, and eventually put the murderer into police custody. The book is fascinating since it is written so "un-like" many true crime novels which are often to full of courtroom drama and endless descriptions of the police involvement in the cases at hand. This book tells the day to day feelings and frustrations of the victims family, their quest to find answers, and somewhat ultimate justice for their sister. It is a "page turner" and well worth reading. UPDATE: As of the writing of my review Smith sits in an Ohio prison at the age of 54 while in his 4th year of a 15-life sentence. UPDATE #2: Sandra Anderson, the dog handler who assisted in the search for bodies in this case, pled guilty in 2004 in U.S. District Court in Detroit, MI to five felony charges (including obstruction of justice and making false statements to federal authorities) involving "planted" evidence cases in Oscoda, Bay City and Oakland County, MI in 1999 involving her cadaver dog Eagle. A two year prison term and financial restitution was paid to at least one (Lapeer) MI. county by Ms. Anderson.
