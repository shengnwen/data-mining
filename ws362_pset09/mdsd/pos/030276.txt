Excellent book that really piqued my interest because of the inspiring topics & enjoyable writing. This is so much more than a "get help" book; its a whole different perspective into Jackie O and her life. And as a true admirer of Jackie O, I felt myself learning more about her, outside of the whole "biography" genre. Highly recommendable as an easy & enjoyable read!!
