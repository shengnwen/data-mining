I've read books on all the rules and technical issues of franchising and thought this would be a good book to give insight to the people in franchises. It does a good job at explaining what people thought franchising would be like and what it turned out to really be. It explains how franchisors and franchisees interact which I found to be suprising. Overall a very good book to read if you are interested in franchising
