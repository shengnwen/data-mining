The Bayeaux Tapestry is a gorgeous work of art that has great historical importance.  This book does it full justice.  The first section is simply the tapestry itself, with a pullout section of brief explanations of each scene.  This allows you to look at the work itself and appreciate its beauty and craftsmanship and to form your own opinions and interpretations.  (By the way, the photographs are so good you think you can reach into the page and feel the stitching.)

Following this are translations of the Latin inscriptions, further explanations of the story and explorations of the artistic and historic significance of the tapestry.  The author's language gets a bit technical in the latter sections, but with the help of a basic dictionary are easy to understand.  Even without looking up the scholarly words, one can appreciate what the author is saying. 

I highly recommend this book.  More than worth the price
