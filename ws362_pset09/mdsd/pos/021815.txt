Theodosia Browning loves living in Charleston, South Carolina, especially in the spring when flowers are blooming and several wealthy people open their gardens to the public for what is known as the Spring Plantation Ramble.  Things go well until Mark Congdon, one of Theodosia's friends, collapses of an apparent heart attack, which later proves to be a poisoning.  Out of friendship Theodosia promises his widow, Angie, that she will do some amateur sleuthing and try to find Mark's killer.  There is no shortage of suspects, especially among Mark's former co-workers.  There are lots of red herrings and the revelation of the murderer at the end is a surprise.  Again, author Laura Childs writes a charming novel filled with characters who have become familiar to readers during the previous seven books in the series.  Charleston is a wonderful setting  and Childs always includes recipes, decorating tips, and of course, descriptions of exotic teas from Theodosia's Indigo Tea Shop
