Many of the reviews lapse into predictably derisive language including "if you read this book you've got way to much time on your hands."   I beg to differ. . .  Men and women the world over are searching for truth.  Many times, as also seen in some of the reviews, truth is mistaken for or deliberatley compared to fanaticism (Heaven's Gate, Davidians, etc).  However, what cannot be disputed - or refuted - is the accuracy of this woman's predictions so far.  

One reviewer stated that there are "lies on every page."  Ouch!. . .  (Something in the book really struck a raw nerve.)

All religions that are predicting end of the world scenarios that seem to converge on this century.  Heck, even the Discovery Channel has "Super Tsunami" and Earthquake programs that predict coming global devastation on a scale that mankind has not seen.  To disparage this woman simply because she ties all of this in with the urgency of getting oneself right with God - not some man - seems entirely plausible,  totally rational, and downright prudent considering what is at stake.
