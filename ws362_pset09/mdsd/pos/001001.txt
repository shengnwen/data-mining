I love this book for many reasons.  It is well thought out and the stories carefully chosen for both pedagogical and cultural purposes.  It makes learning fun and includes enough repetition that you assimilate a lot of vocabulary almost effortlessly.  The same can be said for learning grammar and good sentence construction.

I am one of those people who have a lot of difficulty learning a language and find an audio approach tedious.  This book gave me the conceptual framework and confidence to pursue more traditional methods of learning a language.

While this book won't build much conversational skill, it will certainly support and reinforce such methods.  For those who have only pursued conversational Spanish, it will serve as a fun way to review and to enjoy what you have learned when there is no one to talk to in Spanish.

This book is entirely appropriate for beginners and advanced beginners.  It is progressive and the pace was just right for me.  I wasn't frustrated at all going through the progression and it was just challenging enough to stay interesting without being overwhelming.
