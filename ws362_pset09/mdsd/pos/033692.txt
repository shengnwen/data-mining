Think you would not enjoy a mystery with talking cats--cats that not only talk to each other, but also to humans? Well this one is a really good read, and not at all frivolous or cozy. This is Murphy's 13th book, and as good as the previous ones.

Joe Grey, Dulcie and Kit (all cats) do their best to solve kidnappings, murders, and help their human roommates the best they can, using all their feline skills: their sense of smell, sight, and their ability to get into crime scenes unnoticed. Joe hangs out at the local police department in Molena Point, California, and picks up information that he relays to his fellow sleuths.

In this harrowing tale, Dulcie's beloved human, Wilma, is kidnapped, and then her niece Charlie is taken. The cats are hard put to rescue them. They are up against several very malicious criminals, one an escaped convict with a grudge. Eventually, with the help of the police and a few feral cats, everyone is saved.

The cats are believable, and the clever ways they manage to communicate with those humans who do not know they can talk make this story even more enjoyable.

Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read these books before, you have to try them.
