My original BH&G cook book had the same red plaid cover but the binding fell apart so this seemed like just a replacement. What a great replacement! So far there has not been one recipe that I couldn't find for all of the old stand-by's and a new version with easy to read and understand recipes. They have all worked and given me something new for dinner almost every night. Read and follow for some fine dining
