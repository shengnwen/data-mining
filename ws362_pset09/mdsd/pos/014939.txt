Read the book, then see the movie version, SHOOTER.

Enough has been said about Bob Lee Swagger. Snipers, good ones that is, are a special breed. Most people could not begin to endure what a sniper goes thorough to get "the shot." Steven Hunter does a good job off making "Bob the nailer" a real sniper.

I liked the plot and pace of the book. I can usually find technical errors in this genre of novels, some quite laughable. Only found one incorrect technical term (you find it) which may be attributed to the editor. It was a pleasure to hear the term cartridge rather than bullet. Hunter's description of long distance shooting was very good.

I recommend reading this book when you can devote several hours to it. Hard to put down
