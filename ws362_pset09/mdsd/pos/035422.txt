Greens consumed in this form are easy to take in and make the cravings go away, the mood swings go away, the hair thick, and the skin smooth and firm.  The greens also pump you with energy, and amazingly cause weight loss, even when you consume as many calories as before.  I cannot sit still because of my renewed vitality, and my best friend who also drinks the green stuff just did her mountain bike trail ride in record time.  Victoria just might solve the healthcare crisis--I am serious. I am a happy primate who is finally consuming my native diet-- and I salute Victoria Boutenko for her free thinking and this great contribution to human wellness.

Moreover, my concept of abundance has expanded.  I look outside and see the green and quietly note that I am absolutely surrounded by this vital foodstuff that happens to bring me higher in every way.  We humans do truly live in abundance and would be wise to preserve it
