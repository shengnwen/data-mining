This is the first Ripley's book I've ever purchased, and I love it!  It makes a wonderful coffee table / conversation piece.  Great for readers (or readers-to-be) of all ages!  Even young children will enjoy looking at some  of the bizarre pictures and having an adult read the captions/short blurbs  to them
