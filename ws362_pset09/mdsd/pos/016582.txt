I read this book in its Australian edition, and am glad it's finally out here in the States.  Perlman is a marvelously smart and talented young writer, who is well-known in his native country.  THREE DOLLARS, with its  beautiful language and compelling plot, manages to be moving and witty at  the same time.  Though set in Melbourne, the characters and story are  clearly universal in the post-Thatcherite/Reaganomic Western world.  The  implicit socio-economic commentary, however, is by no means heavy-handed or  polemic;  rather, it emerges only as you find yourself captivated by the  life of Eddie, who's quite the appealing but troubled hero.  Not only do  you struggle with him through a tricky job-related moral dilemma, you also  struggle with him in his challenging marriage to Tanya, a vibrant but  depressed soul-mate.  And isn't that what life is all about -- politics and  love?! 	With a naturally humorous and undeniably clever voice, Perlman  somehow keeps you laughing throughout the pain.  It all builds to a  wonderfully dramatic climax . . .  If you like it as much as I did, you'll  look forward to his next book, rumored to be an anthology of short stories
