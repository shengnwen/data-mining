Fun to read, just be aware that the first few pages don't give a biblical account of creation, but rather describe an evolution of the world. Although God is mentioned as having existed before the world was in existence, God is not mentioned in the formation of the earth or creation of plants, animals, people. Instead, the author gives an account which sounds a lot like evolution even though the author doesn't use this terminology. He goes on to talk about primative people that didn't speak, but rather grunted to communicate. Overall, it is a very fun way to read about historical events
