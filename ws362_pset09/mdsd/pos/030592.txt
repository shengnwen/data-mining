Professor Wells has put together and easy to read guide for the layman to understand the issues behind the Intelligent Design v. Evolution controversy. As a follow-up to his Icons of Evolution, Professor Wells expands upon his arguments and shows the very real problems with the Thoery of Evolution and the scant evidence to support the theory. Sure to cause headaches among the Evolutionists, Professor Wells presents a devastating critique of Darwin's theory, and allows his readers to make an informed decision as to whether or not Evolution is science or science fiction.
