This is a fun and furious read, but it's predessesor - lEGEND -is better.  As is the 1st Rigante novel.  That, to me, was his best thus far that I have read.

Druss is not a complicated enough character, though I did like him.  And the problem I had with his true love, Rowena, was that she made absolutely no attempts at getting away from her captors.  All the while, poor Druss is doing everything he can to get her back.

With her not only not trying, what does she do?  She falls in love with another man!  Thanks alot lady!  I did not like that
