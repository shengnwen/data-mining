This is one of the longest text versions of the Cinderella story I have ever come across.  It is a wonderful telling of the tale, and works nicely to illustrate how this tale is part of many cultures the world over.  I  can't speak to the accuracy of the details of Korean culture, but the  artwork is fascinating.  Due to length of the story, however, I tend to  wonder how well it would hold younger children's attention.  It works well,  though, for illustrating cultural difference to college students
