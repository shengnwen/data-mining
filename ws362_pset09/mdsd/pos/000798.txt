I was never really into reading until I grabbed this book! I was so interested in it that the next week, I went to the school library and got other books to read! It's amazing how just by reading one book, u can read  so much more! It's really interesting how Chip stays by Abby's side while  she's going through tough times with her family. I recommend this book to  anyone who likes novels that deal with teens and how a friend can help you  deal with family problems. Sometimes, the person u think is least likely to  help you, is the first person to help you
