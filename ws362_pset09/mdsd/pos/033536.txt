Today it is just as important to put effort and creativity into how you go to market as into what you bring to market.  Each sales channel has its own strengths and its own limitations.  For example, sales forces can handle complex transactions and provide a high quality of customer service, but they're expensive.  On the other hand, the internet is very inexpensive, but you will be limited to the sale of simple, low-cost products.  The trick is to have a variety of sales channels appropriate to the products, to reach the most diverse group of customers and deliver the right product at the lowest cost.  The authors have provided three steps to building a world-class sales channel system.

1. Know which channels you should be using.  
2. Know how to build those channels into world-class performers.
3. Manage them together as an integrated go-to-market system
