I read this book in sixth grade, and though I am now twenty-six years old, it is still, in my opinion, one of the best books I have ever read.  Anyone familiar with the history of Edward Kelly, partner of the Elizabethan necromancer John Dee, will enjoy this book in extra dimensions, as would anyone well acquainted with the apocalyptic imagery of Ezekiel.  The settings have lost none of their stark horror or beauty on the walls of my memory, the urgency of the threats seem none the less real.  It's a priceless story of bravery, resilience, and ultimately sacrifice, and I look forward to reading it again
