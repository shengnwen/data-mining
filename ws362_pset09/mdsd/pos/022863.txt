Reading the reviews here, it looks as though the people who enjoyed this book have moved on to other things in their lives while the naysayers are having the last word.  This is unfortunate, because David Rakoff is a very funny and perceptive writer.  Although not every one of these essays is a polished jewel, the best of them - his encounter with Steven Seagal, his appearance on a popular daytime soap opera, his report on a Tom Brown survival training course --- stand up as quality humor even after repeated readings.  

Most of the negative reactions come from a common disappointment that Rakoff does not write precisely like David Sedaris or Augusten Burroughs.  What can you say to that?  Either expand your range or wait for those writers' next books to be published.  

Other criticisms seem to gather around Rakoff's tendency to use multisyllabic words, when a "simpler" vocabulary would have sufficed.  While there are many comic writers today who write using everyday vernacular, what is unique about Rakoff is that he reaches for something more profound than a simple comic setup. Getting there, he does risk coming off as pretentious, and he does indeed use big words, which for some people will call for a dictionary.  

In his first collection, Rakoff provides us with good anecdotes, shows solid comic timing, and yes, his big words pass the dictionary test.
