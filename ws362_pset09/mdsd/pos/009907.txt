     Montana 1948 is a really interesting 175 page book to read. It was written by Larry Watson. It is about a boy named David, his mom, and his dad, who just won his second term as sheriff of Mercer County, Montana, and his other relatives. They lived in Bentrock, with was also the county seat of Mercer County. But in during 1948, incidents and plots happen that affect the family. 

     These incidents involve assault, racism, and sexual harassment. There is also a lot of adventure in this book. 

     This book is also kind of sad because David learns awful news about his family. His favorite uncle, Uncle Frank, who was a doctor in the war, was accused of raping his Native American patients. 

     Larry Watson must've put a lot of thought in this book because every event in it can really happen and has happened. 

     If you want to know more, I strongly suggest that you read the book. You might like it. There's swearing, usage of beer, and guns, and other exiting things that might make you laugh.
