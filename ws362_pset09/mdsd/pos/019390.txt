Though it starts out somewhat slow, Rick Moody's novel The Ice Storm provides some excellent insights as to how life was for middle class families in the 1970s. Much of the novel actually takes place in the characters minds, through their thoughts which I personally think is a great way to tell a story. There are very vivid descriptions, the characters are easy to &quot;attach oneself to,&quot; and the novel is filled with many different emotions. Overall, I can definately see why this book has become a National Bestseller and I would reccomend it to others. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, I plan to read &quot;Purple America&quot; and &quot;the Garden State&quot;, Moody's other two novels, next
