Saddam chose the Iraq war and while most of us were sleeping, he was vigorously waging it. Before 911 Mylroie warned us that terror groups worked through STATE financing, safe harbor in a STATE, border passage allowed by a STATE, training camps located in a STATE. Iraq was such a state. The links to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing point to Iraq.

Freedom comes with a price, most of which is being paid in blood by US servicemen fighting terrorists all over the globe. IT IS TREACHERY TO ARGUE EX POST FACTO THAT THE INVASION WAS A MISTAKE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF OUR MEN BEING KILLED AND MAIMED.

They volunteered and accepted because of their potential - and NOT losers looking for a way out of poverty. They know what they are up against. They are the best educated servicemen this country has ever produced; the best trained in the world. They are confident and will win. Saddam chose war, America responded because no one else can or wanted to.

It's idiocy to say "we're not any safer." Freedom is NOT safety. Freedom is choosing to do what one ought to do. There are many more FREE Iraqis thanks to Bush and everyone down the chain of command.

Mylroie's investigation is first rate, and all the Beltway desk jockies who constantly carp behind the President's back about why US should not have invaded Iraq do not know anything compared to Laurie Mylroie
