Yet another bio on Walt Disney, this one written for young people, ages 12 and up. 96 pages in length, it tells the story of his life and career. It is fairly accurate, from a reliable publisher. If you have a child that is younger than this age group, I might suggest "Walt Disney, Young Movie Maker". It focuses more on his childhood, explaining how the events, persons, and places he lived when he was young affected his career as an adult. It really helps kids connect with him
