This noir is absolutely fascinating. An hallucinatotry experience from beginning to end, when strange mutants, organ robbers and very dubious cops wandr in an hurban hell. William Burroughs would have liked "Penny Dreadful".  a more coherent story would have made these novels perfect But surely, this book is worth reading
