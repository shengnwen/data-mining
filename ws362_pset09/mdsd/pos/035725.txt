I first read Coney Island when I was in high school, when I fancied myself a poet. Ferlinghetti's work in this slim volume is much simpler and much more accessible than that of his contemporaries, especially Ginsberg. Part I of the collection, titled "A Coney Island of the Mind," is more deliberate in its stylings and in a slight need of an editor, but expressive nonetheless. The real power of this collection is with Part II, spoken word poetry that Ferlinghetti had performed with a jazz accompanyment. His natural style becomes fluid, moving effortlessly across the page in deep rhythms that bring you directly to the moment of vision
