After finishing &quot;At the mountain of madness&quot; is not difficult to understand H.P Lovecraft's own vision of the world. A vision which by no means can be considered demented or uncanny. The idea of an old  civilization thousands of million of years before mankind is something that  may seem fantastic to some but no one can deny completely. This is the  whole theme of Lovecraft's stories and this is what keeps them so  interesting and at the same time so appealing. I would recomend this book  to anyone who is not completely convinced of the story of the world that  books like to tell. The oldest fear of mankind is fear of the unknown, fear  of the OLD ONES..
