It is amazing how we so easily overlook sleep and the benefits of it. Sure, everyone knows that we all need sleep, but have you heard of "sleep debt", I bet you haven't. This book explains everything there is to explain about sleep and how it affects our well-being. You can call the author the father of sleep science because he's spent most (if not all) of his professional career studying sleep.

I still haven't finished the book because it is so dense, however, I believe that I know more about sleep than any physician in my country, which is both exciting and alarming at the same time. Alarming because many illnesses and health problems get misdiagnosed, and people must unnecessarily suffer.

The main reason why I bought this book at first is because I have a huge interest in the subject of lucid dreaming and its relation to sleep. The author very briefly mentions lucid dreaming in chapter 14 and appropriately refers the reader to one of Stephen LaBerge's books on the subject, which I have. What I didn't know was that Stephen LaBerge once approached William C. Dement (the author) asking if he could use his sleep facilities to study lucid dreaming in the late 1970s (around the period I was born). Anyway, medical doctors PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!
