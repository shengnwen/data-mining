This is an entertaining book, although perhaps not the best of the author's many books. Sill, fans of the author will enjoy reading and solving this mystery, as Dr. Laurie Montgomery, a young forensic pathologist who works in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for the City of New York, begins to take notice that an unusual number of young professionals seem to be succumbing to an overdose of cocaine. She begins to suspect that something is seriously amiss, but what is it?

She strikes up a friendship with Columbo-like Detective Lieutenant Lou Saldano with the Homicide Bureau of NYPD. He does not initially share her concerns over these drug induced deaths, as he is more focused on a number of mob related  killings, which may signify that an all out mob war may loom in the not too distant future. Despite their divergent opinions on the deaths of these young professionals, Lou has the hots for Laurie, but timing is everything. Despite the mutual attraction, Laurie has just been swept off her feet by a wealthy ophthalmologist to whom her parents have introduced her. As it turns out, this ophthalmologist has a mob boss as a patient, the very same mob boss that Lou is investigating.  Laurie's infatuation with this eye doctor causes a little friction between Laurie and Lou.  Still, the nature of their work thrusts them together, and they will discover that their concerns are not mutually exclusive. 

The author weaves a fine plot, even though the author's cookie-cutter characters leave something to be desired. Still, the clever plot will keep the reader eagerly turning the pages of this book, even though the discerning reader will probably solve the mystery before the Laurie and Lou do so.  This book makes for a quick, enjoyable read.
