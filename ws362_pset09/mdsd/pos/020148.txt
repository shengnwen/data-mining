Hampton Sides has written a very readable classic.  Ghost Soldiers gives a blow by blow account of the rescue of the remaining Allied (mostly US) prisoners from the Japanese POW camp at Cabanatuan, Philippines.  The smallest details are noted, many of which are harrowing.  What the POWs went through during their three years of captivity after the fall of Bataan will shock you although readers who are familiar with WWII will know what I mean.  The highs and lows of man's character are laid out for all to see in this book and you can't help but be moved.

Following an "in your face" preface, the build up to the actual night of the raid, following the Rangers through the bush and profiling various individual POW's experiences, gets you to the edge of your seat as you wait for the first shot to be fired and the first prisoner to be rescued.

Hopefully we will never see the likes of WWII again but the people who were there deserve to be remembered and this book has to be one of the best records for that time
