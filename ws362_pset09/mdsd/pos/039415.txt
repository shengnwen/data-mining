I received this cookbook as a gift about a year ago. It honestly set on the shelf for months before I really looked at it. I do not read Southern Living magazine and I usually do not like recipes in magazines in general. These recipes are not what you usually see in magazines. All the ones I have tried are very suitable for cooking at home. For the most part the recipes call for everyday ingredients that are easily found in your regular grocery store. It is divided into months of the year, so that's handy for incorporating seasonal produce. I like how recipes are grouped together so all the recipes you would want for a meal are next to each other on the same page. You may like this or not. Another reviewer mentioned that it was hard to find something specific and that is true. However the general index isn't bad as most recipes are listed by their name and their main ingredient. There is also a month-by-month index which seems like a waste of space since it is in the same order as the book itself.
