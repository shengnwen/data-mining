This is really an excellent, well-written book, with lots of good information.  The sub-title of the book,  "What Went Wrong" does not refer to the knee-jerk question  about why the islamists hate us, it's about how and why the once high culture of Islam has devolved into the violent morass that much of it is today.  The book goes all the way back to the seventh century, and is written from the point of view of islamic cultures of the time.  The book has changed my frame of reference about what is going on in the outside world's relationship to islamic cultures.    Professor Lewis' style of writing is very readable without a lot of editorializing, the way a real scholar's should be.    I have read several of his books now, and intend to read them all
