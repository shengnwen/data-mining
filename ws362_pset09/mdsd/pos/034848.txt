     Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass is an exemplary representation of both transcendentalism and realism.  Walt Whitman was one of the few writers to bridge the gap between these literary movements and Leaves of Grass was, in essence, his opus.  It represented the author himself and was often condemned in Whitman's time for it's blatant descriptions and incorporations of sexuality and homosexuality.  However, years later it came to be appreciated for what it is truly worth as an exquisite culmination of people, emotions, and the democratic spirit.
     Of the many themes covered throughout the 438 pages in the ninth edition of Whitman's masterpiece, symbolism was often used to represent allegory ideas and situations.  In "O Captain! My Captain!" the captain symbolizes Abraham Lincoln and America is ship.  In the captain's death, Whitman is alluding to the fact that in the absence of strong leadership guiding the "ship," there will be a lack of order and chaos.  "Song of Myself" was, on the other hand, explicit in the ideal it depicted.  All fifty-two sections discuss intricacies of semi-specific people or types of people; they come together as one poem and are all part of something larger.  Whitman believed not only in the individual being but also in a larger being that everyone and everything was a part of, in other words the oversoul.  "Song of Myself" is truly filler in the gap between the literary movements because it is so thoroughly transcendental in meaning, yet so precise in describing reality.
    Emerson's was completely justified in praising Walt Whitman's work because it is still today very profound and extremely important in respect American literature overall.  Unfortunately a fairly high mentality is required to take in his poetry for all its meaning and worth.  Maturity and openness is key because often criticism of Leaves of Grass spurns from prudish and thoroughly conservative readers
