If you are just getting into the 1911 this is a great book to start with, Campbell is a good writer and doesn't need many words to tell you a lot. The best part is the pages of reviews of different 45's .... very interesting - he tested several dozen different ones and it really helps you decide what is good and what is not. If you are looking for a 1911 this is a must buy.
