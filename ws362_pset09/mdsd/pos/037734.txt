Let me see if I understand the previous reviewers problem with this book. Much as he states that the words didn't do enough for him, the most straightforward attack seems to be that Kevin Young wasn't poor as a child! IS the reviewer suggesting that only poor people can write about poor people, Southerners about the South? It's a silly line of reasoning that eventually leads to everyone just telling their exact life story again and again. It's a very boring literary legacy that the modern age of poetry and prose believes that just because you say exactly how something happened you've done something profound. The most profound thing an artist can do is to take the incomprehensable world and polish it until we can see and understand it better. This is what Kevin Young was trying to do with the book and the degree of success or failure shouldn't have much to do with whether or not he born in a mansion or a mudhut
