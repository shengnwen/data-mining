I read all the bad reviews of this book and I have to wonder ... what book were these people reading?  I loved the characters - Shep being my favorite.  I thought Jilly was completely realistic and I know several people like her.  Yes, initially, she seems like a b%@#$, but if you take the time to get to know her and give her a chance, she grows on you.  I thought the premise of the story was very interesting, and the inclusion of the Art Bell-like character was humorous.  I read it in two days during a cruise and it was a great choice
