In his new edition of &quot;Stars&quot;, Richard Dyer presents its readers with results of his thorough study about stars in/and Hollywood. It is a good read for anyone, who is seriously interested in a &quot;star phenomenon&quot; in particular, and &quot;Hollywood phenomenon&quot; in  general. Step by step, Dyer focuses on topics such as &quot;stars as a  social phenomenon&quot;, &quot;stars as images&quot;, and &quot;stars as  characters in films&quot;.   He supports his findings with numeorus  examples of many different films and actors, such as Al Pacino, Malylin  Monroe, Tipi Hedren, etc.  He also mentiones Jane Fonda in depth as an  illustration of a specific image construction in Hollywood.  One can only  hope that in his upcoming edition, Dyer will expand his study to include  examples of contemporary stars, since Hollywood dynamics keeps changing  drastically every decade or two
