Though there are some problems with Willard's work, his main point stands: We as Christians today do not take Jesus seriously and there is more to the gospel than just "getting saved." That is good enough, but it is stopping short of the fulness of salvation God intends for us. He intends for us to live in the pattern of Christ, to have access to the Kingdom of God in our everyday lives, not just after we die. Willards explanation of the Beatitudes is also brilliant, though I don't necessarily agree with the conclusions he comes to each time.

It only remains for me to take Jesus' words seriously, which is very hard. It has always been hard, even for those who heard those words from Him in person. "Those who hear my words and DO them...." So Willards work both simplifies the Christian life, and challenges us.
