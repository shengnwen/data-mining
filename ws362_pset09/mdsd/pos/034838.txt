Many reviewers have commented that Taylor's "American Colonies" gives indigenous peoples a larger role in North American history than most previous studies do.  This perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the American Revolution.

Among the Revolution's motives were "liberty" (a better form of government than that provided by London) and "empire" (eliminating British barriers to the colonies' territorial expansion).  Since the indigenous people were the ones most affected by the colonists' territorial expansion, giving them a larger role in the history, as Taylor does, makes the history read more in the "imperial" vein.  See chapter 18, "Imperial Wars and Crisis: 1739-75."

In an important way, the "liberty" and "empire" motives both came down to land.  The colonists knew that a key reason they were freer than the average Briton was that they could move into land acquired from the indigenous peoples.  Jefferson summed up their objective as "an empire of liberty," which Taylor uses as chapter 18's final section heading
