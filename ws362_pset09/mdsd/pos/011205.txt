This is an outstanding study of an unusual (for the time) woman who, through her letters, conveys a strong spirit, a sense of love of family, and a series of lessons on life ranging from child rearing to finance to business strategy to the honor of doing the right thing.  Her letters take one from childish glee to love's happiness to tragic sorrow and occasionally to the discomfort of her well-intended but blatant pushiness.  They introduce the reader to the circumstance and the event but leave enough out for brevity which allows the readers' imaginations to picture for themselves the pictures portrayed by the author's imagery.

An excellent read for women and men alike.  It is a keepsake in my librar
