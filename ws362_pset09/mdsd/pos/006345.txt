this book would be best accompanied by an anatomy book.  To really get a good visual, it's a good idea to review muscle attachments and origin sites in a(n additional) book with color.so My biggest criticism (and it's so easy to criticize) is that while many of the bones are pictured the as the actual size, there are not photographs of the bones articulated with neighboring bones.  I found it hard to side bones because of this.  So, it's a pretty good book in spite of my harshness, just not by itself.
