This was a moving book.  I was hurt, yet intrigued by the text and pictures of the brutality of slavery.  If there are people out there who would not want children to read/see this book, it would be only because  they are ashamed of what happened to a race of people by the hands of  another people. The truth has been hidden and ignored long enough.  Every  American needs to know what our ancestors went through.   I am still hurt  by what I saw and read.  A must have for every American
