I would've given it 5 stars if it weren't so long.  The story really drags in some places.  I found myself skipping whole sections to get back to the story.
That said, I loved the plot, the adventure, and the twists.  I can't decide if I like the woman or hate her.  I guess that's what Haggard was looking for, and he did a splendid job of it.
Character development was very good, and the visual affects of the scenery and what was happening were just wonderful.  Definitely a good novel, and excellent characters, especially after being so succesful with hunter Quartermain
