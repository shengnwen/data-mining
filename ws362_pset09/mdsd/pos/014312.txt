THE VAN GOGH CAFE is a selection of stories about a "magical" cafe in a particular town in Kansas. The cafe is run by a man named Marc and his daughter. The cafe used to be an old moviehouse/vaudeville theatre and some of the performing magic is still around. Strange and uplifting events happen at the cafe. Some would call them bizarre, some just mere coincidence, others perhaps Providence. The book pretty much lets the reader decide. Whatever the case, one will go away feeling kind of warm and fuzzy and uplifted about life.  I usually don't recommend books that are totally warm and fuzzy, but this is a book that I'll make an exception
