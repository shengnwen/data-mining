I purchased this book and a few others in the series for my 4  year old.  My son is very intelligent for his age, yet some of the stories were a bit long and beyond his attention span and/or understanding.  However, I am not disappointment as I am confident that in time, all the stories will be appropriate. I would recommend this book
