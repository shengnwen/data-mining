As a little girl this was my favorite book. My parents read it to me over and over. My mom saved it all these years and recently first read it to my 3 1/2 yr old nephew. He now shares my love of this story and asks Grandpa to read it to him all the time.

The story is very well written and illustrations are wonderful for little kids to follow along with.
