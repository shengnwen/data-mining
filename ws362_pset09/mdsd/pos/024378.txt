I loved this book!  I am new to the voice-over industry so I am always searching for any information I can find on, about and by the people in the voice-over industry.  What truly interests me is finding out how these extremely successful voice actors got to where they are today.  I was thrilled when I heard that some of my favorite voice-over talents were going to contribute to the book.  What could be better than learning from the pro's themselves?  Through their personal stories and information they share, the reader will learn many invaluable lessons and tips that might otherwise take many years if not a lifetime to learn.  

It is a definite must have for any actors library.  Buy a few copies and give them to your friends in your acting classes, they'll thank you, and you'll feel good knowing that the proceeds from this book support a very important mission.  A sincere thanks to Joan Baker and to all of the wonderfully talented actors who contributed to the book.
