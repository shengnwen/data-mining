This is a very easy to read book filled with lots of tidbits of information for establishing rules, building a sense of community among students, introducing materials through guided discovery and creating a  healthy partnership between schools and parents. Teachers will learn the  three R's of proactive disipline: Reinforce, Remind and Redirect. The  exerpts come from The Responsive Classroom Newsletter which is a free  publication printed three times a year and available through Northest  Foundation for Children. Their address can be found in the book. I strongly  recommend this book especially for beginning teachers
