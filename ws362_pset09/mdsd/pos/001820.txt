The art work and illustrations in this book are more than worth the cost of the book.  The text is an absolute delight.  There is something quite captivating about this work, both in syntax and it's relation ship to the art and in the story itself.  Actually, many of the illustrations could be framed and would look quite good on the wall.  I am certainly not going to go into the story line here, that has been done time and again on this review page, but I will say that this is one of the better books I have had the pleasure of reading to my kids and classes.  Highly recommend this one.
