This is a great diet book. I lost 35 lbs in 5 months. I found about this diet in the internet and tried it. I lost 8lbs in the first week. After losing about 20lbs I found this book. This book is slightly different and better than the original version that I was following. I was doing this diet continuously taking 1 day break. Sometimes I was bored of drinking the soup everyday. This book has many ideas to spice up the soup. I definitely recommend it.
