Overall, a very satisfying read, but somewhat disjointed.  The beginning and ending -- the two parts which take place at Boot Magna in the English countryside -- are laugh-out-loud funny.  The middle section, which takes place with the protaganist, William Boot, in the mythical African nation of Ishmaelia, is more straightforward and serious.  The portions of the book which chronicle Boot's relationship with Katchen felt like they were torn out of a Hemingway book, given the sparse dialog and direct emotions.  I felt as if this book might have been started by a very young, impressionable Waugh during a time when he was experimenting with different styles, trying to find the one which best suited him... styles borrowed from Hemingway, Wodehouse, and Greene.  Its slightly disjointed nature made me think that it was a book which he worked on in fits and starts... would write a little, put it back in the drawer, revisit it a couple of months later.  Overall, it's a very good book by a writer a few years away from his peak
