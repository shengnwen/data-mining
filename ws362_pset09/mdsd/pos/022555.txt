While there have been tons of books on HK cinema, they mostly touch on the popular movies, directors and stars.  You hear of John Woo, Jackie Chan, Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam etc etc.  But there are next to none, if any, on the  history of HK cinema in English.  This book is an essential read if one  wants to know more about the political and cultural events that shaped HK  cinema.  Thankfully it isn't only just essential and informative, it also  manages to be enjoyable
