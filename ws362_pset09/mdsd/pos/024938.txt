This spare novel caught my eye since I had worked for many years for a company owned and mostly populated by Chinese.  As such, I was an observer of the culture and the indirect way of communicating that permeated the company.  "Waiting" was a novel that was familiar to me due to my experience, yet startling new in its exploration of the character of a man willing to wait, rather than to act.  The character development of the major players is excellent and the emotions that each feels is described in a way concise, yet palpable way.  I am not sure whether to give this 4 or 5 stars - I keep waffling so I wish there were a 4.5 designation.  Nevertheless, highly recommended
