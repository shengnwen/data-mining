As a child, born and raised in France, I was taught evolution by the school system. As a kid, I also read the Bible and was quite impressed by the story. I never saw an issue between the two because one is based on science and the other on faith. The old continent (Europe) has learned at its expense the devastating consequences of mixing religion and state affairs. For some reason, the USA is still struggling with the definitive separation of State and Church. This book is part of a higher issue than just evolution but also on our government and ill-informed people that use again religion as a personal gain.
I recommend the creationist/IDC camp to get familiar with Logic so they are capable of making a sound judgment about life and matters that revolve around it. Finally, I wonder how many of these creationists/IDCs have actually read the "On the Origin species" by Darwin, where the author already actually recognizes that they might be some refutations to his theories because of some missing links not yet discovered.
