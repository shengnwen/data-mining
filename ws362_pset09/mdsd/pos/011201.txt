A delightful and easy read. Actually, three stories in one as the two main characters tell their own life tales in the context of the book. A story about overcoming hardships and tragedy through friendship, love and most importantly, hope. I felt especially drawn to the character of Mr. Serle, portrayed as a kind and warm "father-figure" type whose wisdom was both powerful and inspirational. The gastronomically descriptive text always made me hungry and wishing I was sitting at the tables enjoying the delicious foods with characters. I recommend this book
