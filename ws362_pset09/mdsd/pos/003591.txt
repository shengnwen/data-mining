Matt and his dad thought that they could go make a house in the forest.  So they did.  When they were all prepared Matt's dad said, "Can you watch over the cabin for us when I'm gone to get the rest of the family?"  Then one day he started walking out into the woods with his gun to practice shooting it.  He shot a deer and then the next day this guy came up to the cabin and asked if he could sleep the night there.  When Matt looked up he looked for the guy and saw that he wasn't there and the gun was gone.  Then he started getting really hungry.  He saw some honey in a bee's nest.  He ran to grab some.  Bees started to sting him.  He ran in the water.  Attean and his grandfather came to save him. Matt started teaching Attean how to read.  Two months had gone by.  Attean and his family started leaving.  Then one day the dog that Attean gave him started barking and he saw a figure far away.  Then he got so excited he ran to the big huge this he saw and started shouting.  It was his mom and dad.  He let them go to the cabin.  His father said, "what happened to your gun?"  He said that one guy took it.  He had a bow above it instead of a gun.  His ma said that the dog was strange.  People that are really into reading will like this book.
