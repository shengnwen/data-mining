I truly enjoyed every minute of this novel.  As only Lois Lowry can, she creates a world that beckons you to enter with each word she writes.  Her characters drive the action with such ease that when I reached the end of the book I wanted to know more.  This would be a great way to encorporate new vocabulary with students.  It would also make a wonderful read aloud.  I would recommend this book to fifth and sixth graders.
