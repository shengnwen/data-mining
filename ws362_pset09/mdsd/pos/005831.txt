This is one installment in the If you take a . . .Series.  My 3 yr old and I know this book by heart.  It is so cute to go along with the whimsical adventure with this mouse.  You can equate the mouse to a very imaginative child.  I love the picture of the mouse in his boxer shorts singing.  It makes for a great anytime story.  the whole series is a must have for any child
