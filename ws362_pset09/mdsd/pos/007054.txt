This book, the first detective novel written, is a great combination of the eloquence of the Victorian novel and the entertainment of a mystery novel. Collins' main characters of Gabriel Betteridge and Franklin Blake are immensely likeable and there's a good deal of humour here as well. The only complaint I have about the novel is that it's entirely anti-climactic. Most of the suspense comes near the middle of the novel and you'll spend a good portion of the latter part of the novel with a pretty solid idea of who the culprit is. Overall, though, a very good read
