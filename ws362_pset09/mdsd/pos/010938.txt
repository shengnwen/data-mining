Well balanced with sources well referenced. Great glimpse into the thoughts of many of the people that of have shaped our Democracy. Very brief discussions covering the pre-Revolution thinking through the Reagan era. 

Only 4 stars given because the discussions dealing with civil war mind set was very one-sided without any depth. Lincoln illuminated in a very biased light. Categorized all pre-war Southerners as ignorant slave-holders, when in fact only 6-8% of Southerners owned slaves in 1860, and most were against the institution.

This was just small section of an overall, well written book
