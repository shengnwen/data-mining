Mayer's missive about miscarriage of justice in Ada, OKlahoma, has been re-released to coincide with best-selling legal thriller author (and attorney) John Grisham's first foray into non-fiction True Crime, *The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town.* Although chronicling different crimes and different cases, they occur on common ground. Both constitute a grippingly nauseating expose of Ada, America, run totally amuck. (Be afraid.  Be very afraid that this can and IS happening right here, in the "Land of the Free")  In the Afterward to this update, (no pictures :-(   Mayer aptly describes the obscenity of District Attorney Bill Peterson (WHAT?!? He's still there, in his absolute power?!? Proving what they say about absolute power - it corrupts absolutely) and his band of Good Old Boys as "Kafka in Oklahoma." 
Coerced, by interrogators who would make the SS & KGB proud, into dreaming up implausibly impossible "dreams" of what could have happened to a missing convenience store clerk, 2 then-young men have been matriculating in the Oklahoma prison system for over 20 years now.  
This reviewer, graduate of the University of Oklahoma's College of Law, is simply dumbstruck. I have dreams of Peterson storm-trooping through his Pontotoc County Courthouse to the swirling strains of "Darth Vader's Theme." As another son of the South would ask: 
People of Pontotoc County, What Are You Thinking? 
And shame on the rest of you all, Oklahoma, for allowing this boil on the buckle of the Bible Belt to not merely fester, but prosper. 
Both books should be required reading for those who profess to believe in Liberty and Justice for All.
