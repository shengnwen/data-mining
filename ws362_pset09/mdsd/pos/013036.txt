I looked around a lot for a bird book for my son/his dad who love to watch the birds together. I purchased this after reading another review so I felt that I should give my own. Considering how difficult this book was to find, it was definetly worth the wait. My son is 21 months and just loves reading the "Birdee Book". The pictures are beautiful and the written text is short and sweet which is perfect for young children. I also feel that it is doing a great job of teaching him the difference between birds in the sense that there are ducks, geese, birds, etc.. and prior to this book all of them were just "Birds". I would recommend this for any child above 18 months.
