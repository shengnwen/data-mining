Bill does it again with his straightforward, practical guide of a book, Selling Results.  I found this book helpful for several reasons.  One, Bill builds on concepts he introduced in his first book, Think Like Your Customer.  Urgency, Motive, Business Value, and focusing on the buying process.  Two, Bill is constantly reminding us that we must get the customer to commit.  He tells us to be willing to walk away when it makes sense to do so.  Three, he challenges sales people to take honest assessments of their sales efforts.  For example, while many sales people neglect prospecting and hide behind the veil of customers demanding too much rep time, the fact is it must be done to avoid suffering the consequences of the neglect.  Four, he provides valuable tools like the Opportunity Scorecard to decide how attractive each opportunity really is.  And five, Bill reinforces a running theme of staying on the offense with your selling.
