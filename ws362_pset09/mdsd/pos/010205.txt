This is an extremely readable and enjoyable account of a hostage situation. Patchett does a great job of painting all the characters in multi-faceted ways. For example, one of the hostages is a staid vice president of a Japanese company, but turns out to be a master pianist. The account of the hostages and rebels' days together is witty, fun, and only sometimes is it melancholy.

For me, this was a 5 star book until the epilogue. That part of the book was extremely anticlimactic and rang false when taken with the rest of the book. 

If Patchett had not gotten self-indulgent and ended the book without the epilogue, this would be one of the Top 50 books I've ever read
