I liked this as much as "To Kill a Mockingbird" (the baseline of "books anyone would like"). WHY? Though EXTREMELY different in EVERY aspect, it has the same *plain* intrinsic honesty. 

Reads well too. Sent a copy to my Mom & she stayed up all night reading it.

Normally, I'm a Jane-ite and fond of other 19th century English writers as well as a fan of "good" mysteries (latter being very enjoyable mental gum chewing) but this book - on its lonesome - got me VERY enthused about Indian literature.

Extremely well written. And I've read a bunch o' other Indian novels since & I'm wondering why Indian authors are sooo much better than current US writers.
