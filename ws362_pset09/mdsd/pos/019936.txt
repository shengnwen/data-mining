A compelling book,loaded with insightful comments of the way customers responses at the retail world, ideas gathered in many years of  experience the author and his team had expended watching people behave naturaly in a retail enviroment. A good book for business people interested in learning consumer behavior in a practical sense.

You might get dissapointed if the title of book led you to think you will find conceptualized steps for merchandising sucess, even the lessons the author gave are fact based they are encompassed by american culture and might fall short in sight for ethnic markets. However, Paco Underhill show us a great example how taking a closer look to customers interactions at stores can reveal us the obvious -but often overlooked- thruth: shopping is a pleasure experience, the more the senses get pleased the more the products/brands are prefered
