One of the sneakiest novels I have ever read. For those who started with "Bright Lights, Big City," the book is a complete sucker punch. Let me explain. The novel Ransom reads like an expat in Japan version of Bright Lights, which is to say a novel of manners in which there is no real danger to the hero. This kind of novel usually functions as an armchair excursion to amuse and ultimately reassure the reader. It is meant to be read in a self-indulgent swoon. Until the ending, which is the equivalent of a bucket of ice water to the balls. Be prepared to feel betrayed. After you calm down, you realize that the meaning of the novel is the COMPLETE opposite of what you thought and could not possibly be more bleak. I read this novel when it came out and I'm STILL pissed off, but I can't deny it's power
