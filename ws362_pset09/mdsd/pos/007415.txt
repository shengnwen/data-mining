I got this book on audio  and i must say it was a great listen. I didn't feel like having to read through the whole thing i figure that would take about a week, but i finished the audio tapes in 1 day. It was like you could see everything that was happening unfold right in front of your eyes by listening to it. THis is a great portrayal of the dating scene at times i found some of the situations he went through were some of the same as the ones i went through
