I wish that I had discovered this book before I had graduated from design school. Not only does this user friendly book offer excellent advice from all the tops in the industry (done in short - to the point paragraphs), it  is very informative as well. The book is divided into different sections on  different types of design along with an interview of sorts with a person in  that industry. What I found to be most informative was that at the  beginning of each section there are recommendations on the types (as well  as number) of pieces your portfolio should contain if you are interested in  going for a job in that particular part of the industry. I would recommend  this book to people in school, just graduating, or perhaps looking to  reenter the job market in a different specialization of the field
