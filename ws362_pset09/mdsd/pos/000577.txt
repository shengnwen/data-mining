I received this book as a gift and I really enjoy it.  I have tried a few of the recipies so far. The pumpkin pancakes (yum and a huge hit with the kids), the chenois salad...I love this have made it several times and a few others.  Each are simple and turn out looking just like the picture...great for someone looking for some simple and innovative ideas....who knew you could do so much with a packaged crescent dough....interesting, innventive and tasty!  I am looking forward to trying some more recipies from this clever lady
