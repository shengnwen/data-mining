I got this book the instant it came out.This is the topic I have been looking for from Deepak. I've always felt that his background in medicine, spiritual experience and wisdom traditions puts him in an almost unique position to really dig into the subject of the afterlife. He really delivers. This is a facinating read for the intellectually and spiritually curious.
