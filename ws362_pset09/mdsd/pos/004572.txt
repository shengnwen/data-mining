It's a pity that this book is out of print. You learn all this wonderful theorems at the colleg. But where are the limits? Why some theorems have so strange assumption? Well, this books will provide you with answers, sometimes surprising ones. For example: Two functions whose squares are Lebesgue-integrable and the square of whose sum is not Lebesgue-integrable. And this book is full of examples of this kind, nearly 240 answers to a wide area of basic analysis. One of the advantages of this book: You must not seek for a long time to find the example you are looking for. The examples are sorted in chapters each covering a distinct part of analysis. At last let me cite Mr. Gelbaum himself to characterize the scope of his book: &quot;At the risk of oversimplification, we might say that (aside from definitions, statements and hard work) mathematics consists of two classes - proofs and counterexamples, and the mathematical discovery is directed toward two major goals - the formulation of proofs and and the construction of counterexamples.&quot; And cursing Goedel, if none of both succeeds. &quot;Most mathematical books concentrate on the first class, the body of proofs of true statements. In the present volume we adress ourselves to the second class of mathematical objects, the counterexamples for false statements.&quot
