I only wish I had the writing talent to come up with a review that would do this story justice.  We've opted not to get a DVD player to entertain the kids in the car.  Instead, we listen to audio books that we pick up from the local library.  "Bud, Not Buddy," was by far the most wholesome book we've chosen.  In this Audio book, actor, James Avery, reads in a lyrical, better-than-James Earl Jones, voice. 

You'll fall in love with Christopher Paul Curtis's clever, funny and, ever-so optimistic orphan, Bud Caldwell, as you follow Bud on a journey through the Michigan of the Great Depression.  The writing is witty and colorful.  Curtis's lovely story will stay with you and leave you feeling hmm hmm goooooooood!

We chose the audio book only as a way to entertain the kids on those long boring drives, but since we are home schooling, this book has become a launching pad for lessons in creative writing, the history of the Great Depression, and, of course, that Great American Institution--Jazz.
