If you are looking for a novel filled with action, this is not it.  The only complaint I have is that at times, the book was slow and had me asking "Well?  Isn't there anything else?"  

Gaiman's antidote to the slow-moving story is a collection of unique and enthralling characters, wild and unpredictable, but believable and alive at the same time.  The story takes place across modern day America and is kept fresh with an almost constant change of scenery and characters.  While many characters have very brief rolls, Gaiman (of course) did not let us down by skimping on their personalities.  

I picked this book up after reading "Neverwhere" and, after two outstanding books, am now completely in love with Gaiman.  This book is easily one of my all time favorites - it has successfully captured my imagination and forced me to examine what it means to be American.
