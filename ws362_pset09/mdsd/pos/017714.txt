wow, this book was fantastic...from the very beginning I couldn't stop turning the pages...i'm not sure why this book had a lower average rating, but I thought it was fantastic..

there's lots of things going on in this book, but that's one of many things Woods is good at: having multiple sub plots but using them in such a way that the reader doesn't get lost trying to keep track of everything....everything flows really well..

if I had to pick a gripe about the book it would be the ending...it's one of those 'did they or didn't they??' type of endings....which is cool, but if you're like me and you need to know everything, it'll drive you nuts! =)  

as with the other books in the Barrington series, i'm sure the events of this book will impact stone's later adventures..

gripping and fast paced
