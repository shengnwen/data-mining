I have to give this book credtit. It was principal in starting my interest in the Great War. I read "March of Folly" and loved it and thought I'd give this one a try.

I normally don't read history written by women. It's not a sexist thing, just that experience has taught me that women usually write about the factual with too much emotion. This book was no exception. Barbara Tuchman never avoids a chance to slam the historical figures in this book. Her pot-shots are inordinately aimed at the Germans, no surprise there considering she was Jewish. She even devotes a whole chapter to German-only atrocities in Belgium and France. The insults were entertaining at first but really got old as the book read on. For this reason I docked one star.

Aside from that, the book was very well written and did keep my interest. I learned that alot of what happened had alot to do with timing. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Great War and the figures involved. There is tons of backround information on the players involved too, I enjoyed that alot
