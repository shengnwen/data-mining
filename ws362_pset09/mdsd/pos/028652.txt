This book is a real page turner. It was my first Shobin novel and I kept comparing him to Robin Cook. I must say his characters are much more believable than Cook's. Above all the woman protagonist, because this is  where Cook almost infallibly fails. I appreciated, too, that Shobin did not  elaborate too much in scientific explanations. This would have killed the  tension. I will certainly read all the other novels by David Shobin
