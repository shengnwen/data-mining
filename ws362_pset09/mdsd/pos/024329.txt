This book gives a broad overview of the American Revolution.  It gives a very detailed account of the events that lead up to the Revolutionary War.  The book uses personal jorunals of the common man and those from the actual decision makers.  Book does pass over some events like Valley Forge, the War in the southern colonies without complete explanation.  Very well written with a wide overview of the war.  Also talks about life at home during the war and life in the camps of the soliders.

One thing I did not enjoy about this book is that it inculded several chapters on the development of the constitution and government after the War.  In my mind these are events are seperate.  

I would recommend this book
