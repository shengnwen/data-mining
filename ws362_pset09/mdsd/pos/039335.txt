On the cover of this wonderful cookbook of recipes from Trevor Hooper's Raku Restaurant are the words "A Nibbler's Delight of Fusion Cooking". I'm an old fashioned cook so I don't know about fusion in cooking, I always thought that had something to do with Neutron bombs or unlimited energy for free, but I do know good cooking. And let me tell you, you will not be disappointed in anything this book has to offer. 

Last night I did up the Yucatan Salmon with Tomatillo Sauce on page 69 and I have to tell you, this is a dish that had my mama drooling, and she is the queen of Mexican cooking. Oh yeah, it's hard for her to admit that lil old Katie can match her when it comes to serving up a mouth watering dish, but I did it last night and you can impress your mama or mama-in-law or the best man in your life if you get this book and serve up some of the Nibbler's Delights found inside.
