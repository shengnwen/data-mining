Bestselling fantasy and graphic novelist Neil Gaiman is also an excellent writer of short stories and several of the short pieces in this new collection were either winners or nominees in award ceremonies for fantasy, horror or science fiction. Its tough trying to pigeon-hole any of the stories included in here like "A Study in Emerald" which combines a Sherlock Holmes mystery with science fiction to great effect. "How to Talk To Girls at Parties" combines teen angst with creepy science fiction for a wonderful story and "Harlequin Valentine" is a deliciously funny tale of love and loss. "The Monarch of the Glen" ends this book in a very high note by following Shadow, the hero of Gaiman's modern classic novel American Gods, as he embarks on an unexpected supernatural adventure on the coast of Scotland. Longtime fans of Gaiman's writing as well as those who appreciate modern fantasy or the short story form will find a lot to enjoy in this collection
