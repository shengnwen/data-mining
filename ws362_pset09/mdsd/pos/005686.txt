"The Scythians 700-300 BC" by Dr. E. V. Cernenko is a fantastic introductory book on the Scythians.  The Scythians lived about the same time as the ancient Greeks, migrating out of the Iran area into Eastern Europe, leaving burial mounds as far apart as Mongolia and the Ukraine.  Although there are many questions about these people that may never be answered, they have left a fair amount of surviving artifacts.  Most impressive are the fine detailed gold objects.  

Albeit there are many unanswered questions on the Scythains, this volume provides an outline of their history, weapons, clothing, and battles.  The illustrations in this book are great, truly bringing them to life.  Their scale-mail armors and splendid weapons are an impressive sight.  

I found this to be among the fastest reading books in the Men-at-Arms series.  It left me wondering and wanting to learn more about these ancient people and their history.  I would highly recommend this volume to anyone interested in ancient armies.
