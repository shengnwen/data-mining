I was put off by the title, because I thought &quot;achieving focus&quot; would be a book about meditation or some vague New Age platitudes. Instead, the book has specific, helpful, practical advice for specific problematic situations. I was interested in the book because I thought it would help my ADD husband. However, I also found some of my own problems described on some pages. 
 
 Two minor criticisms, both related to grammar: I wish the author had used more commas to break up long sentences into logical clauses. Also, I wish the author would not use the word &quot;they&quot; when the author means &quot;he/she&quot;. For example, in one section that gave advice about communicating with one's spouse, there was a sentence that said something like &quot;if they say...&quot; rather than &quot;if he/she says&quot; or &quot;if your spouse says&quot;. I was confused. I was wondering who &quot;they&quot; were who suddenly appeared in a paragraph about a one-to-one conversation with one's spouse. &quot;They&quot; only makes sense if you have several spouses. I sometimes had to read a paragraph twice, even though I am normally a fast reader and a quick study. These grammar flaws are minor annoyances; the book is still very helpful.
