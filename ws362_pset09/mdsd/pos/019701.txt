Food Chemistry is an amazing book, BUT, be careful before you buy it. You DO have to have a fairly strong background in the fundamentals of structure, nomenclature, reactions and the like involved in organic chemistry and biochemistry. They show some great reactions and offer some pretty helpful tables and charts on chemical properties and reactivities of various foodtsuffs. The later chapters, such as dairy, meat/fish, fruits are extremely comprehensive. I will at one point be using this as a text book for an advanced food chemistry course. However, if you are just beginning to explore food chemistry I would suggest starting out with "On Food and Cooking," and work your way up to this AFTER you get a bachelor's in chemistr
