I have never been really into Women's Studies, but I recently saw this book and was intrigued.  Like almost every woman on earth, I struggle with my feelings about my body.  It's just so great to know that I'm not alone.  It's inspiring to read about women who've made peace or made progress with their body images.  This book definitely made me more aware of images of beauty that society considers normal.  I realized that I've spent my whole life swallowing what the media tells me to and letting that form  my self image.  The contributors to this book are very diverse but are united as well
