This is an impressive piece of work.  Callow catches Welles out at countless examples of self-mythologizing, yet never gloats or judges him  harshly -- merely letting his findings speak for themselves.  And he  doesn't diminish Welles's achievements or fascination as a man one whit.   (Nor does he customarily split infinitives, which is refreshing in this day  and age.) Though personal failings and the stuff of gossip are noted,  Callow does not dwell upon them.  His descriptions of Welles's stage  productions in the 1930s and early 1940s especially make me wish I had been  alive then -- or videotape technology had existed -- in order to see them.   The introduction notes that most studies of Welles ask &quot;what went  wrong after _Citizen Kane_&quot;?  Callow sought to discover what went  wrong BEFORE it, and I think he did an admirable job.  I can hardly wait  for the second volume
