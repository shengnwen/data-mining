I use this book for Kindergarten story time and, as always, try to find a way to help them see a relationship between the story and their lives. Sorting by colors and sizes is something they enjoy, and they are thrilled when I bring out a REAL button box for them to poke through. The artwork in this book is well done and shows the wide variety of buttons students might see; I thought having Girl Scout uniform buttons was a nice touch. "Cute as a button" (which I print on bookmarks for them) is a phrase we hear often over then next few months, and everytime someone finds a button they bring it straight to me. This book is an excellent reminder to students about finding joy in everyday things.  
P.S. I also set out Taback's "Joseph Had A Little Overcoat" which has buttons on the back cover.
