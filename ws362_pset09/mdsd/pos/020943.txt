It is very basic.  I think many people may figure out what to do with their paint pro with included manual.  Author should have instructed more on layering and masking with more complicated pictures.  I would advice anyone who bought this book also buy Ken McMahon book on a subject. Oh, how much money we as a customer spend on those self-help books.  And the thing is we find only one or two brilliant ideas in them.  So, buy all books on subject.
