I rather see the movies than read his books. The movies are always excellent and takes less time to watch than to read. What can I say? I rather read other books. 

Still, this wasn't bad. Grisham in some ways was prophetic with this novel. I think half of America can agree that the 2000 election was tampered with, in a different way with this story. Events happened that horrified the American public that swayed the election. But some criminal judges in prison had a secret on the candidate that was set up to win. A secret that would ruin his chances if it became public knowledge.

My favorite character to read about was an fearful alcoholic lawyer that was in on the scam with the judges. His part alone made the book fun. The book is slightly dated but I still recommend it if you are a Grisham fan because I can't see this being made into a movie.
