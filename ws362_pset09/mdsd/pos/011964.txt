This book does not really posit a theory that hasn't been discussed many times before. The title of the book clearly states what Rabbi Levine's theory is: that we cannot wait for a great leader to usher in a messianic age, rather, that all of us, in our own way, must bring about a better world. Rabbi Levine does a nice job of surveying the idea of the Messiah in Judaism. He examines references in the books of the Prophets. He then gives a historical survey of messianism in Judaism, from the earliest followers of Jesus, to messianic figures such as Bar Kochba, Sabbatai Zvi and Jacob Frank. In times of turmoil, when the hopes of the Jewish community were at their lowest, many Jews found renewed hope in the belief that the Messiah has arrived.

These hopes often had tragic consequences. Many of the Jews of Jerusalem, during the days of Roman occupation, followed the charismatic Bar Kochba into battle. With his fierce determination, there were early military victories but ultimately, the rebellion was crushed with devestating results. The tragic decimation of the Jewish community may have been the worst disaster suffered by the Jews until the onset of the even more horrific Holocaust of the 20th Century. Sabbatai Zvi and Jacob Frank, more than a millenium and a half later, also had rabid follewers who, believing each was the messiah, gave up strict observance of Judaism based on the blasphemous examples set by these false messiahs.

The point of the book is that we cannot sit and wait for a messiah. If there was an actual Messiah, we should not wait for his appearance passively but instead, seek to better the world as we await the messianic event. If there is no messianic leader, then it is for each of us to bring about positive change in the world
