I purchased a Canon 20D about three months ago.  Because this was the first camera I have owned capable of writing to raw, I searched the internet and read articles on the Adobe website (I use CS2) to get an idea about what it was all about.   I played around with raw files, but I was not getting anywhere.  Then I purchased Raw 101.

First, it is a fairly easy read relative to reading Adobe manuals and Class Room in a Book, so I just took a couple of hours and read it. Then I went to my computer and went chapter by chapter while actually working with my own raw files.  I have to say that by the end of the second reading, I felt very comfortable with Adobe Camera Raw and I now use it fairly regularly.  

The book is a great way to get a feel for the process.  The problem that I have had with other training materials is that you are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material, much of which covers stuff that you will rarely if ever use.  On the other hand Raw 101 gets right to the point and teaches you to quickly understand the how to gain the optimum use of raw processing.  I also agree with the other reviewer that this book would be helpful to all users whether a beginner or an experienced user. 

Although I have used Photoshop for several years, I consider myself a beginner when it comes to Adobe Camera Raw and I found this book invaluable.  I highly recommend it.
