Where this book stays from the story contained in the ancient texts concerns the statement in the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew (translated by George Howard) that Jesus had "innocent blood" [Mt.27:4]. In Genesis humankind was driven from the Tree of Life once the bloodline became tainted and the need for a sacrifice arose. If Jesus had had a human father then he would not have "innocent blood" which would also conclude that Mary was a surrogate mother.   No descendant of Adam can claim to have innocent blood unless THAT BLOOD came from another source. This admission in the text comes from Judas Iscariot who was an eyewitness to the life of the historical Jesus
