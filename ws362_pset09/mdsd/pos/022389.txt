Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is a great novel, but not at all comparable to War and Peace. Firstly, I think he should have gone with the original title: Two Marriages; because the book really has two main characters, that of Anna Karenina and Levin. The last book seemed unnecessary to me, book eight, in which Tolstoy explores death once again through his characters, as he was indubitably obsessed with mortality. I didn't think it entirely appropriate, and I've read much of his opinion on death in War and Peace and Ivan Ilyich already, so the ending did not seem fitting for the masterpiece that it was. Also, this version of the classic is abundant with spelling mistakes, typos that, though they can be overlooked, are somewhat irritating after a while. They are simple typos, and one wonders how the editors missed them. I wouldn't recommend this particular version if you want to read Anna Karenina and appreciate it to its full effect. Lastly, of course, I want to praise Tolstoy for his amazing writing style, which is much easier to read, I think, than War and Peace in this novel. Such scenes as the mowing scene with Levin and Anna's stream of consciousness when she is in utter turmoil at the end of the novel in book seven are inspiring. I also liked the scene in which Levin's brother lies in a hotel on the brink of death for days
