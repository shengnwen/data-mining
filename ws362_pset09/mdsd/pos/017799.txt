I became interested in reading about Peggy Guggenheim when I visited her museum in Venice last spring.  It was one of the highlights of my trip.  

Mary Dearborn did an excellent job.  However, I found Peggy Guggenheim's life pathetic.  She was a completely selfish person and an unimaginably awful mother. My heart went out to her children.  Her childhood was not ideal, but certainly not so bad that she couldn't avoid winning the worst semi-wealthy mother of the century.

The author gets 4 stars.  Peggy Guggenheim gets minus 10,000 stars
