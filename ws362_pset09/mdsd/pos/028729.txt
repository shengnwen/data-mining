While this isn't the best book in the world for writers, it is one of the homiest, most honest, most down-to-earth one you will find.  While King may have developed verbal diarrhea in many of his later novels, this book is very focused and has that one-on-one feel that King is so famous for.

There's much more to this book other than "how to write a story".  King touches on his personal life, his struggles as an adolescent, a college student, a young husband and father, and later his struggles with addiction to alcohol and drugs.  What emerges is a highly personalized, conversational account of what it took to make Stephen King what he is today.  You will feel as if you are sitting on his back porch, sipping tea or perhaps a beer, and conversing, as two good friends are apt to.

King also touches on his near fatal accident in 1999, when he was struck by a vehicle while taking an evening stroll.  As one who has spent time in a hospital, his accounts are vivid and extremely well told, and commendable to him is how lightly he treats the suffering that he must have gone through.  Also commendable is that he neither blames nor exonerates the person who struck him, he simply relays his perspective on how it effected his life as a writer and as a human being.

When King does address writing, he is brief and to the hard point of major problems, mainly passive form and overuse of adverbs.  The heaviest reference he uses is Strunk and White's 'Elements Of Style', which every serious writer already has a copy of.  Also for the writer, there is one overt challenge and many hidden ones that King presents, so put your pen to paper and follow his lead.

Overall, this is a book that will entertain fans and encourage writers.  Stephen King is one of the best 'yarn spinners' in the business, and 'On Writing' takes me back to the good ol' days when King spun tight prose and homestyle dialogue that captured the hearts of millions.  Me included.  Enjoy!
