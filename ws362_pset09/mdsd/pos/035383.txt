Whether or not one truly "believes" in what Allison writes in her book, the hope she brings to the reader is valuable.  One can probably relate to some of the things she mentions that involve spirits of deceased loved ones.  I have experienced similar incidents, although nothing even close to "bringing someone through."  The book is one that is hard to put down - a quick read.
