I don't make the statement in the title of my review lightly. Jefferson Scott is really great. His new series, Operation Firebrand is everything I expected and more. When you read Jefferson Scott's books, the best way to describe his writing is: "it's like seeing a movie in your mind's eye" and those are my words (Glenda) in quotes. Even if you've never read a Christian novel before because you think it might "preach too much", I challenge you to read any of his books. His fiction novels includes the action and suspense without any terrible language. Jefferson Scott knows how to convey the thoughts of his characters without the cussing and swearing that is very typical of almost every secular fiction book these days. I've been a fan of Jefferson Scott since his earlier books, which include "Virtually Eliminated", "Terminal Logic", and  "Fatal Defect : A Genetic Thriller". I read them all and each time I finished I wanted to start another novel he'd written because I enjoyed them so much. I've told my other book reading friends in Jackson, MS about him and also my sister in Chicago and each time the verdict from the reader was "this guy is great".
