The first time I heard of Chesty was from the DI's at MCRD.  I am glad I have finally gotten a chance to read about his career.  How the banana wars were fought was very interesting.  The book as a whole was fascinating.  The only negative was that the letters to his wife were starting to get uninteresting.  Otherwise a very informed book about the greatest marine ever
