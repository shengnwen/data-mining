I found this book to be both practical and insightful. The author has managed to strip away all of the "consultant speak" that you often find in books like this, and replaced it with concrete examples of leadership. I have also had the opportunity to attend a seminar conducted by the author and it reinforces many of the fundementals discussed in the book, as well as introduced new concepts. I recently purchased this book for a number of my employees and others I mentor within my organization. I highly recommend this book
