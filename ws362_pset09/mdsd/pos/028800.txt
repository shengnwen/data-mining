On something of a departure for Clarke, he explores the depths of earth's oceans in this book, rather than his usual space sagas. It succeeds remarkably well, and is better than his more well-known novel of the ocean  (The Ghost From The Grand Banks). The plot is good, with several surprising  mini-twists, and the characterization is better than on most of his works.  Also, as with all his books, the ending is beautiful and poetic. A must  read for the Clarke fan
