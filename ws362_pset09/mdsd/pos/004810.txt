       Buchanan(B)has done his homework.He goes back to the founding of the American Republic in 1787 and shows that every single war with a foreign power(War of 1812,Mexican American War of 1846-48,Spanish American war of 1898) and/or military action(1802-1803 battles with Tripoli pirates) engaged in up until the aftermath of the Spanish American War(McKinley's claim that God had told him to  sieze  the Philippines combined with  the subsequent defeat of Filipino patriots in the war of 1902-03) involved clearcut,direct threats to American borders/interests. It is the period from 1899 ,starting with the completely unjustified war against Filipino patriots,through the eight years of the Woodrow Wilson administration,1912-1920,that American military force is used in situations where no direct/indirect threat to American interests/borders starts to be undertaken .The best book to read concerning these unjustified military operations is still Marine General Smedley Butler's account.The main conclusion that can be derived from B's careful analysis of the historical record is that the term "isolationist"is a gravely inaccurate description of those Americans who opposed American entry into World Wars I and II,the Vietnam war and/or the second Iraq war of 2003-2006(?).One can,of course, disagree with the arguments put forth by those who opposed entry into these wars(i.e.,direct American interests were at stake).However,to label them as "isolationists", in an attempt to avoid having to meet  their arguments head on,is simply nonsensical
