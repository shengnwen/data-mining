I don't begin to pretend to know the first thing about golf, but Tom Coyne's book is a delight to read.  If you have any golfers in your life, this is a must read!  It is a delightful account of the trials and tribulations of pursuing a dream, going for a goal - and universally relatable.

Tom's tone is unique - light hearted in the face of adversity and struggle. The novel details everything from weight and handicaps, to relationships with family and friends. As he lives in Philadelphia now, any Philly golf lovers will be able to relate as he details his training and preparation, and it's always nice to know the place that an author is speaking of.

I can't wait until his next book comes out - "A Course Called Ireland" which is in progress now
