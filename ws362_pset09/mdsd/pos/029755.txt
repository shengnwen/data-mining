It's a Minnesota winter, and homicide detectives Leo Magozzi and Gino Roseth are on the trail of a killer who buries his victims inside of snowmen. That trail leads them from Minneapolis to rural Minnesota where the body of a parole officer is found. While investigating, a long dead body is found inside a root cellar. The bodies are starting to pile up and answered are needed.

P.J. Tracy is a mother/daughter writing team behind the Monkeewrench series. Monkeewrench (title and subject of the first novel) is a computer outfit of various techie misfits. They barely played a role in this novel, and I must say I missed their quirky personalities. Monkeewrench is what makes this series unique and without them, it's just another standard crime novel. Once I got over the disappointment,though billed as a Monkeewrench novel, Monkeewrench was barely featured, I quite enjoyed the interwoven past and present story line. My one quibble would be it took a long time to set up the story--almost 100 pages with a constant introduction of new characters. I had trouble keeping them straight at first. Once I did, the story was engaging. The cast of characters was multifaceted, and quite interesting. The story had a cold, wintry feel set against a bleak Minnesota winter which seemed fitting. I'd recommend Snow Blind on its own merits, just don't expect to see much of Grace
