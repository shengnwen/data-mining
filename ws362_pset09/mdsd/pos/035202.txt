As soon as I finished reading David Rosenfelt's first book Open and Shut which I thoroughly enjoyed, I thought this book cried out for either a sequel or series.  I guess Mr. Rosenfelt accommodated me even before I read his first book because as soon as I finished this book I realized there were two more which were already written featuring the main character and other characters found in the first book.

First Degree by David Rosenfelt is the second book in what I hope will be a long series which features Andy Carpenter, a rather unconventional and unique lawyer.  But now Andy has inherited a large sum of money from his father and with little need to work for money, Andy hasn't worked in the legal profession in quite some time and has little interest in the cases which are offered to him by clients.  As he puts if he's suffering from lawyers block. 
 
Then word reaches him that a missing and possibly dirty cop has been found decapitated and burned beyond recognition.  Suddenly Andy is ready to go back to work.  Not quite sure why this case intrigues him, Andy also never expected his client to be released so quickly after he claimed be the murderer.  The next person who is arrested turns out to be a former policewoman who not only worked with the murdered man but knew just how dirty and corrupt he was while for worked for the police department Hired by the former policewoman will test every skill Andy has as a lawyer and there is no option about to win since this woman who readers may remember from Open and Shut is Laurie, Andy's girlfriend. 

As the author David Rosenfelt provided for us in his first book, 
this is a roller coaster of a mystery which will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this series for those among you who enjoy procedural legal cases.  I did rate this book with a B+.
