The Company is certainly an epic. It's easy to offer comparisons to Norman Mailer's sprawling 'Harlot's Ghost' but this would be unfair as they are vastly different books. The Company is very hard to put down, once you get past the slightly ponderous descriptions of the 50s and the Hungarian war, but once it hits stride, it's a top notch read. To call it a mere thriller is certainly selling it short.
There's enough action to satisfy the most ardent Le Carre and Clancy fans and enough to satisfy fans of Graeme Greene's 'entertainments' as the fictional characters make their way through the narrative, there's plenty of interaction with the famous and infamous. One of my few criticisms was the stereotypes Littell reduces many of these real life people to (Kennedy the playboy, Reagan the ignoramus, Yelstin the alcoholic) but it's a small gripe.

Well worth a read
