Dr. John E. Sarno has been very successfully healing chronic pain through his mindbody treatment methods for over thirty years, and has himself written four books on the subject.  Thousands of people have been cured just from reading his books.  After a fruitless search through the conventional medical establishment, Dr. Brady was, in fact, finally cured of his own serious chronic pain by Dr. Sarno, who calls the mindbody diagnosis he pioneered; TMS, or Tension Myositis Syndrome.

Dr. Brady began applying Dr. Sarno's techniques successfully to his own pain patients, and expanded on them to bring in the spiritual dimension, in addition to mind and body, which is important for some patients.

Dr. Brady calls his diagnosis; AOS, or Autonomic Overload Syndrome, but it is actually the same thing as TMS, packaged with a more structured 6-week plan for curing chronic pain.  And he acknowledges Dr. Sarno as "my mind-body mentor.  I appreciate you and am always grateful to you for showing me another way in medicine."

The book is well-written, and is a welcome addition to the growing field of mindbody medicine.  Anyone in chronic pain should certainly read this or one of Dr. Sarno's books before even considering surgery, which has a far less successful record of curing chronic pain.

Unfortunately, most medical school students are taught to look for physical causes for physical symptoms, and thus they tend to ignore the emotional or psychological causes that are at root of the current epidemic of chronic pain.  Dr. Brady has made an important contribution to overcoming this epidemic
