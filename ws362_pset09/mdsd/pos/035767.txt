Read this book and you will forget about all other books you read so far. There is absolutely no match for this book. Once you start reading it, you just cannot keep it without finishing it up. The author takes all the credit by his style of expressing the thoughts. I bet, no one has ever expressed their thoughts in such a beautiful manner. Had there been an option for giving 100 stars, I would have given it 100 out of 100. Go for the book, you will love it
