This book contains a very wide variety of career options, be it young or be it old! If you don't know what's out there and you're older, this is a great book to look for answers. If you're young and just starting out &amp; don't know what's out there, this is a great place to start. There's even a job in this book called &quot;cat house architect&quot;! I'm considering working in the animal field, and think this book has helped me, at least in the beginning stages of what I would like to do. One idea though: check it out from the library
