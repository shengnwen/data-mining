Anyone who reads this after reading "In Cold Blood" will be surprised.  Where "In Cold Blood" had plot and force and direction, this book has poetry, mood, and mystery.  Where "In Cold Blood" had characters, this has atmosphere.  
They're very different books, and probably shouldn't even be compared.  
This book does have good characters though, though their relationships with each other don't evolve in the way you might hope they would.  The characters include a young boy come to meet his long lost father, a girl that's full of life but socially awkward, and a cousin whose motives are hard to define and suspicicous though tender.
And it also has plot, but it's a low, meandering plot that doesn't pay off in any sort of traditional way.  
What the book really has plent of is SETTING.  The book's setting is alive, though--a remote mansion in a quiet corner of the Deep, decaying South...full of sinister old invalids, bird-killing women, and potentially pedophiliac cousins.  Everyone's a mystery, everyone's relations to everyone else is a mystery, and the story plunges the reader into a sort of pleasureful confusion that it never really attempts to take you back out of.  
So, it's cool if you like that sort of thing.
