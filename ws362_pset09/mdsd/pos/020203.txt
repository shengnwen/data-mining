I really enjoyed Terry Jones' Medieval Lives when it was airing on TV, so I was even more thrilled when I discovered this book!  If you liked the series, this book will not dissapoint you,and if you haven't seen the series, this book will not dissapoint you.  Really a great addition to any British History collection
