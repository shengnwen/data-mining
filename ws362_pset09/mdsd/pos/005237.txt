Exposure, not over exposure, is key to guiding your kids.  I have enjoyed spending time with my 5.5 year old daughter plucking experiments from this very well written kids' science book about every other weekend.  The change of state experiments: ice to water to vapor was one of the first ones we did, and, with our globe in hand, it led to a discussion of how water cycles.  One warning is that it takes times to prepare for these experiments.  Do you homework before, else you will have a bored kid asking you repeatedly one the fun starts.

1. Please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book: Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients.

2. I have REVIEWED many books from undergraduate to graduate in: PHYSICS, MATH, ECONOMETRICS, and HISTORY among other areas
