This book is the definitive biography of an unbelievable life.
If you saw "The Aviator" then you need to read this book. The movie gives you only a glimpse of a few years of an incredibly eventful life, but this book starts out from birth and goes through the childhood, adolescence and adulthood, and also the later years where Hughes was mostly in seclusion in Las Vegas, and other places. Hughes was a remarkable man, but also a very mentally ill individual, especially near the end of his life, and unbelievably, also a surprisingly cheritable person. Reading this book is like reading a "Believe it or not" and once you start reading, it is difficult to put down. I would highly recommend this book. It was a tremendous learning experience and at the same time, very enjoyable
