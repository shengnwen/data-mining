I would recommend this book to anybody that is about to take 70-270. I would say a word of caution though about this book. It is truly intended to be a suppliment to actual training from either a interactive self-paced class like Test Out or Prep Logic. If you try to pass the 70-270 with this book alone you may run in to difficulty. Also, I would recommend exam insurance from Microsoft if your testing center allows it.
