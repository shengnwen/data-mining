The story of Oliver Twist, written by Charles Dickens, is a classic bildungsroman, about the difficulties a child had to endure to survive in the 1800's. Dickens satirizes the atrocious trait of human selfishness by illustrating how it comprises ones humanity as the helpless and vulnerable are victimized for personal gain. Oliver Twist is an orphan from a small village not far from London, who is forced into social conventions by a city council. He escapes his horrible captor, a woman who steals food money for her personal use, but unfortunately lands in the hands of a criminal mastermind, who forces him to pickpocket in the London streets. He luckily is taken under the loving care of a family who gains the information of Oliver's previous captor. Many scenes are dedicated to the fallout of this criminal family which proves that with a positive environment, people are able to succeed in life. Oliver Twist has been around for nearly 200 years and I found it a very good novel, not only for its content but also for its moral truths. It is interesting because it allows children and young adults to imagine what life was like back then and to contrast their lives to Oliver's. This realization allows the reader to see that some people have more difficult lives then others and to not take advantage of them
