Reading letters to Galileo from his daughter is something every scientist, historian, or interested reader can now enjoy. Dava Sobel tirelessly hunted across continents for the letters, and then learned Italian in order to translate them into English. The result is a splendid and insightful collection, revealing the Galileo that history forgot. Instead of the familiar and legendary iconoclastic Church-challenging rebel, we see a pious man who fathered two nuns and spent a great deal of time trying to reconcile his science with his God. This book will sweep you away to a time and place full of conflict and misunderstanding, a place that hasn't existed for four hundred years, but is undeniably very present today
