This book shows some fresh ideas from a very known and popular Darwinist Richard Dawkins, that writes some interesting books like "Selfish Gene" and "The Blind Watchmaker".

Most passages are related to biology and evolution. He comments about the everlasting man's childhood in comparison with chimps,  the incredible story about Mexican axolotle, a "adult" tadpole, discuss the linking of sexual role and the economics and other interesting evolution topics.

Some of more fascinating passages are diversions from main expertise's author. 

Dawkins talks against relativism and your dangers, kidding with a judge's reaction faced with a witness relativist faced with a judge question  "Are you was in Chicago last night?". He argues about the human negligence with animal life and talks about abortion and fetus resemblance with evolution's history. His questioning about jury and conformity are revealing but of difficult solution. 

There is space for curiosities that makes me think about. There is a box machine created by a North American engineer that shows a most perfect instance of complete uselessness.

The most hilarious chapter is about a absurd fake post-modernist text, created by  a North American physical,  that was accepted by a prestigious periodic. After, he was inspired and co-writes a book about called "Intellectual Impostures" that point outs and analyses obscure texts from Lacan and other texts, specially when they dare use physics and mathematical concepts. Dawkins discloses a website that creates on the fly a random post-modernist text. It's delicious!

A warning for some people. He is very incisive against all religions and alternative medicines. About the last, he quotes "There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't works" 

Some chapter in the end are a little bit tedious, except for fanatical Richard Dawkins fans.
