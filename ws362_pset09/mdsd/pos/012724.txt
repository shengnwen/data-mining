I love the yoga sequences and descriptions of asanas in this book.  In order to really use it, I had to go through and highlight the important elements of each asana, since his descripition last for pages and is quite detailed, and you just can't hold it long enough to read everything!  I also love the guiding priciples he offers, like lines of energy.  However, the beginning portion of the book, before the descriptions of the asanas, is a little difficult to read.  He is very wordy, I read sections to my family and friends that actually made them laugh as he goes on and on about something, making a good point but making is about 7 times before he moves on.  Better too much explanation than too little, I guess, but please be sure to get past that part to to the asanas, don't get discouraged!  Erich Schiffmann is a wonderful teacher and a very wise man, his message has changed and reinvigorated my practice
