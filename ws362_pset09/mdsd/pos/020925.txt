This book fulfills its claims.  I found useful its review of numerous alternative approaches to MS.  Clearly western medicine has not figured out the perfect response to the disease.  This book is a way to be imformed of developments in both traditional and alternative medicine. Part of the nature of the disease is that no single treatment works for everyone.  This is a good book for an overview of what options exist and whether they seem to work
