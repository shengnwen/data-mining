I love this book.  It is very helpful in teaching my child about the Faith, Traditions, and Sacraments of the Catholic Church.  The book also is divided into great sections based on the Saints, Sacraments, Feast Days and Holy Days.  They also break the book down into months of the year to develope awareness of the events and signifigance of each month.  The reading materials and activities are great
