I recently read Suze Orman's Young, Fabulous, and Broke (YFB) and found that a very helpful guide on how to begin building a solid financial foundation for a young man. Given the quality of her advice in that book, I chose this as a follow up, and I was interested to hear about her philosophy of money as indicated by the "spiritual steps" in the title.

Some reviewers say that she repeats herself in her books. Certainly some of the advice here is included in YFB, but some of her retirement advice was new for me. Also, she includes more stories about her own life and about her clients' lives. The advice on wills vs. trusts was especially helpful.

The emphasis on "exercises" was not that helpful for me. When she tells me to write down my history and experiences, I don't feel I'm getting more than a slap on the back for journalling, which I already do consistently. I'd prefer that Suze stick to financial advice and leave more of the counseling to the psychologists. However, I am glad to hear her testify about some of her own attitudes about money and her family's experience. More so than the exercises early on, I found that her philosophy towards the end of the book was very revealing. Again, I'm not sure she needs to explicitly use terms like "dharma" to get her points across. But she does make a strong case that those who treat money well will see it nurture them regardless of the amount of money that they have in their bank account. For a nation that is struggling to recover from terrorism and hurricane tragedies, this is simple but sage advice.

While I'd recommend that those who are 35 and under read Young, Fabulous and Broke first, I found this book helpful as well, and I do plan to use some of these ideas with my parents and to plan my own retirement in the future.
