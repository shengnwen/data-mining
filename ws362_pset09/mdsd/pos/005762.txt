This is a beautiful book! 

I was excited when I learned it was being released just in time for my Autumn vacation. The first book in this trilogy made a deep impact on my way of seeing life, making the immediate purchase of "Radical Knowing" a given. 

Christian de Quincey is adept at writing in a nearly conversational manner, even when discussing some very difficult ideas. He helped me to feel comfortable with my lack of formal education as I followed his lead through some truly mind-changing concepts. 

This book is more than an affirmation of how it feels to be alive and sentient in this world. It is also a testament to the power of storytelling in the way we relate with each other on all levels. After reading it I feel that telling old stories in new ways just might make a rather large difference in this world. Christian de Quincey, in "Radical Knowing", reminds me of Mark Twain's statement in "The Mysterious Stranger" - "Dream, other dreams, and better".

I enjoyed this book, but it also crawled into my heart; and there it sits, winking at me, as a reminder that life can be better than we imagine, if only we have the courage to imagine in the first place. I will read it again. And again.
