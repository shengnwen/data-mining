The philosopher Nietzsche once said, "That which does not destroy [or kill] me, makes me stronger."  Guess what?  There is finally a practical book that shows you how to do that and this is the book!!

This is not a cookbook of instructions but a book of practical guidelines to help you discover inborn abilities that NO one else can reveal to you.

What are some of the features of this book that enable you to do this?  They are as follows:

(1) TRUE STORIES.  The book is punctuated with true stories from those people who were initially knocked down by disruptive change.  These people were able to access their will to survive, and even gain strength from their adversity.

(2) SELF-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY INSERTS.  These short activities are for helping the reader get the most out of the book.  They occur at various places throughout the book.  

(3) DIAGRAMS AND CHARTS.  These also occur at various places throughout the book.  These are to help the reader understand important concepts.

(4) THE AUTHOR'S WRITING STYLE.  All of what the author writes is easy to understand.  I could find no technical psychobabble anywhere in the book.

(5) OTHER RESOURCES.  For those who want more information, other resources are listed at the back of the book.  An internet address is also given.

I especially liked two chapters.  There first one is entitled "Thriving" which reveals how to grow in adversity instead of being a victim. The other one is entitled "The Roots of Resiliency: Your Inner 'Selfs'."  This chapter examines and helps the reader understand his/her inner resiliency resources.

In conclusion, being a disabled person I can validate what the author says in the final paragraph of his book: "It is...adversity [that] can lead to the discovery of strengths that you did not know you had...and a difficulty that almost breaks your spirit can be turned into one of the best things that ever happened to you."
