The version of the book that I read is the one originally published back in 1979. It came out of a box in my friend's garage, and I decided to read it because he remembered liking it so much. I liked it, too. Although it is rather conventional in its structure and some aspects of the plot were left underdeveloped, I thought that David Morrell had a good handle on the genre and wrote some interesting characters--all men who have endured personal and professional failures and retreated to a small town in Wyoming to live life on a smaller scale. Their self-esteem as well as their lives is put on the line with the appearance of a mysterious virus that changes whatever it infects into a savage, murderous animal. I wonder if the makers of the film &quot;28 Days&quot; were familiar with this book.
