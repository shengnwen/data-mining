This was an interesting book.  It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read.  The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era.  I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time.  I plan on reading several other works by this author.  It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language.  I would recommend
