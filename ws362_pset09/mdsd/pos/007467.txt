This is a first in a new series set in the Western US. It centres around an Arapaho reservation. The principal characters are a Jesuit priest and an Arapaho lawyer. The story itself is well written, the plot moves along at a good pace. The clues are fairly given, allowing the reader to follow along with the protagonist. If there is one thing that I found a little sterotypical was that all that the white people, with one exception, are out to rip off the Natives. I have no doubt that this goes on and went on. Yet, it would be better to have a mix, such as in the Tony Hillerman works. Still, an excellent read and an author I would continue to read
