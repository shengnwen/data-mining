My husband and I are very pleased with this book as a &quot;family title&quot;.  It includes all kinds of crafty celebration ideas, recipes, rituals for the major Sabbats (or Pagan Holidays).  It offers several pages on the origins of the traditional celebrations and the historical significance of each.  This goes much more indepth than most Pagan/Wiccan books that only mention Sabbats in passing.  The activities are group/family oriented and give the reader a few ideas for new (and also steadfastly traditional) ways to celebrate our holidays of the year.  Well written and enjoyable for everyone
