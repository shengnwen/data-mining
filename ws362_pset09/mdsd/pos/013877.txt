I have great respect for Dr. Clark and her cancer fighting program. However, I feel it is important to add that the nutrient selenium is also important in fighting cancer. This was demonstrated dramatically in a large placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study -- the most prestigious type of scientific study of nutrients and drugs -- which showed that people taking 200 micrograms (mcg) of selenium daily had only half the death rate from cancer as those given a placebo which did not contain selenium.

Specifically, a large group of people who were given each day a yeast tablet enriched with 200 micrograms of selenium had only half the number of deaths from cancer over a seven year period as a similarly large control group who were given a daily yeast tablet containing no selenium. The results of this dramatic study were published in the medical profession's own journal: The Journal of the American Medical Association.

Yeast tablets enriched with 200 mcg of selenium are readily available at pharmacies as well as health stores all across the U.S. for about $5 or so for a bottle of 50 to 100 tablets -- only about 10 cents or less per day. Nevertheless, most doctors pay no attention to the above results published in their own medical journal. Think about that, selenium (at 10 cents per day or less) has been shown in a large clinical study to cut the death rate from cancer in half and nobody tells the public about it. Incredible! In my opinion, as a research chemist, everybody in the U.S. should take supplemental selenium every day whether or not they choose to follow Dr. Clark's regimen -- with which I have no quarrel.
