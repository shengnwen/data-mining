         The Egypt Game was a great book filled with mystery and suspense.  I liked the way Zilpha Keatley Snyder made April and Melanie so different on the outside, but exactly alike on the in side.  They are what made the book flow so easily.  The part of the Egypt Game that amazed me the most was the part when the boys, Toby and Ken, joined the Egypt Game.  On the outside they are big jocks that act all tough.  But on the inside, just like April and Melanie, they are nice and friendly.  The diversity of the characters really helped the book flow.

	The Egypt Game was a book that pulled you in, and would not let go until you finished.  The suspense was a huge part of the book.  With out it, the book would have been as boring as the dictionary.  The main plot is of April and Melanie becoming friends and starting the Egypt Game behind an old store.  They end up having to stop after a murder is committed in their neighborhood.  The plot alone was suspenseful, not even counting the part where they catch the murderer.  Overall this book is a great read.

         The book did have some bad parts in it though.  I disliked the way Zilpha Keatley Snyder didn't go into great detail about the part when the murderer grabs April.  The part just ended when the murder was scared away.  The murderer didn't even try to pull her down the alleyway or anything.  He just ran away instead of trying to drag her.  That was the only lame part in the book.  In my eyes this would be a great book to read if you can't find anything to read.
