 Russ Bryant did a very good job with showing the toughness of the Rangers. I Learned an aray of things that i didnt know. The things that i learned will help me with the my personal Ranger training. I Joined the Army and will ship in june for Ranger training. With the knowledge that i have learned it will keep me out of trouble and maybe put me ahead of my class
