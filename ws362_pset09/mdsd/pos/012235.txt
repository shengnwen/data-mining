This book is great for those who want to go into depth about the original 12 steps.

This is one of the original books used by AA in the early days and provided great insight into this organization, regardless of what you may think of it. 

I confess that I am annoyed when others use this platfom as a forum rather than for BOOK REVIEWS. Statements such as "...many people.. died because of this ..." are judgements about AA and 12 steps in general, but not of this book.
