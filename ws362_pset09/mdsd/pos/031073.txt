You won't walk away feeling any smarter after reading this book, but you will walk away with a smile.  Colorful characters and imaginative places along with a lovable main character make this a pleasure to read.  If you like witty dry humor, and interesting Sci-Fi you will enjoy this book.  This is nothing like Martin's other books and it is breath of fresh air.  I highly recommend this book
