WHAT TO DRINK WITH WHAT YOU EAT is a beautiful book filled with great ideas of what to wines and other beverages (from iced tea to lemonade) to serve with different dishes.  The photography is absolutely mouth-watering!  It's fun to flip through and read about what to serve with everything from chicken to chocolate brownies.  This book is definitely worth the price
