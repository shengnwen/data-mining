Having read the Bagavad Gita, it only much later dawned on me that Carlos is Arjuna and Don Juan is Krishna - only the wisdom is completely different. But in the Gita we have Arjuna who has an ordinary mind and not much bravery at all who yet faces the fact that he has to make a rite of passage which seemingly involves summoning courage to fight an all-inclussive family feud, but becomes something far more spiritualmysticalmetaphysical as he keeps balking at Krisna's encouragement to go through with the pasage. Arjuna keeps telling Krishna he doesn't understand a word Krishna said and Krishna patiently launches into another in-depth explanation - and it is evident that in order for Krishna to fully express the wisdom, spirituality and higher truth of the cosmos, it is necessary for Arjuna to NOT get him and to be continually the baffled coward, hopeless to ever attain gravitational escape velocity, and always planted at square one while Krishna patiently and lovingly imparts the esoteric wonders - like one of those books - "Karma for the Complete Idiot".Castaneda seems to have applied the same schematic - whether knowingly or not - to spoonfeed the Don Juanisms to the reader. And they ARE truly profound - they're too heavy to be something Castaneda just sat at his writing table whipping up out of whole cloth!Castaneda did his research and it's the power of the Don Juan "nuggets" that make the books truly transcendent and generous in their magic - which is contagious to a reader! That said, however, I got the feeling that Castaneda was, by the 4th or 5th volume, really starting to spin his wheels and using more effort than content to take us to the next level. Castaneda has done a great service in giving humanity some cracks to fall through in our supposed finite  and material trappings. And so has the Bagavad Gita
