Cochrane provides a detailed text at the leading edge of Finance.  It is written in an informal manner from one who loves Finance, to others who love Finance.  As such, it is not an introduction to the field or "Pop Finance for Dummies".  That said, it can bring one with a strong background in math and moderate background in Finance to the leading empirical edge of Asset Pricing.  Although written in a light manner, each chapter requires several readings to understand.  Definitely not for wimps
