C.G. Jung Speaking is a classic. It is superbly edited by William McGuire and R.F.C. Hull, the former was the executive editor of the Collected Works of   C.G. Jung and editor of The Freud /Jung Letters, the latter was translator of the Collected Works until his death in 1974.
C.G. Jung Speaking is a chronological series of interviews and encounters including several kinds of testimony from Jung and about him.  Each segment is introduced and given a context ranging from a boyhood memoir of his friend Albert Oeri to six months before his death on June 6, 1961 when he met with the diplomat Miguel Serrano. Topics range from a Cosmopolitan article Diagnosing the Dictators to a discussion with Charles Lindberg on Flying Saucers. 
The following is a sample from an informal talk titled Is Analytical Psychology a Religion? 

"We all must do just what Christ did. We must make our experiment. We must make mistakes. We must live our own vision of life...People call me a religious leader. I am not that. I have no message, no mission; I attempt only to understand. We are philosophers in the old sense of the word, lovers of wisdom."
Much misunderstood and maligned, Dr. Jung has been described elsewhere as atheist, a mystic, occultist, prophet, poet, polygamist, misogynist, con-man, anti-Semite, racist, psychotic, guru, Gnostic, and American spy.
  As my Zurich   training analyst, A.R.Pope remarked: "It is always better to get information from the horse's mouth rather than the other end."
