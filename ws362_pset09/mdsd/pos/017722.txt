Not having an real idea of the events of the time as we did not cover it at school I thoroughly enjoyed the research and well written history of the War. It was well detailed particularly covering both the British and American political issues, althought it felt like the author tired and wound up the final years very quickly. Dispite that a very good account and an relatively easy read for a subject like this. Thank you Author for the reseacrh which was obviously huge !.Written by a Kiwi(New Zealander) discovering American history for the first time
