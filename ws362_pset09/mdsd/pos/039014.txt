I am a big fan of ghost stories, especially supposedly true ghost stories from Michigan.  I absolutely adored Gerald Hunter's first book, and I waited anxiously for the sequel.  I had heard rumors that the second one would concentrate on Detroit and the surrounding suburbs.  This pleased me as I live in Metro-Detroit, and very rarely find ghost stories about my area in print.  When I finally picked it up, I was somewhat disappointed to find that only a handful of the stories were from southeastern Michigan.  Also, stories from other U.S. states were included at the end.  There have to be more haunted locations beyond the U.P., and other norhern Michigan parts!  For me personally, reading a story about a haunt hundreds of miles away is as relevant as if it were in another state.  Other than this complaint, the book, like the first one, is a great read.  Mr. Hunter has a very laid-back, yet detailed style of writing.  Whether you're from Michigan or not, you should pick it up.  The story from Dearborn Hgts. alone makes it worth the price for admission
