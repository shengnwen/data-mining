Susan Blackmore has written a textbook on "consciousness". Do not be put off, it is eminently suitable as a reference. A feature is the extensive bibliography at the back. Blackmore is a determinist but freely discusses the work of other researchers who do not share her viewpoint.

For anyone seriously wanting to come to grips with the latest ideas in human consciousness, this book is invaluable
