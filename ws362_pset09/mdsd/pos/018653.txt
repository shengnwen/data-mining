&quot;The Risk Pool&quot; is just perfect Russo, although at some points it is apparent it is only his second novel...but just barely. The characters are reminiscent of &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, but the plot and emotional weight is more similar to &quot;Empire Falls,&quot; meaning this is both a seriously funny and serious book. I agree with a previous reviewer...the first half can be slow moving, but stick with it through the first 50 pages or so, and you'll start to get your just rewards.
 
 Typical Russo, this is a story of a small New England town (Mohawk) that has seen it's best days pass by. Sam Hall is a ne'er-do-well who is trying to be a father to his son, Ned, but is constantly letting himself and his son down. &quot;The Risk Pool&quot; follows this relationship and the intertwined relationships of the other people living in Mohawk. It's hard to explain why Russo's novels are so wonderful. If you've read him before, then you know why he's just one of the best novelists America has right now, and &quot;The Risk Pool&quot; can stand on its own on the shelf beside &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Empire Falls.&quot; 
 
 If, on the other hand, you haven't had the chance to read Russo yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? This book is as good a place to start as any. NOW...GET READING!!!
