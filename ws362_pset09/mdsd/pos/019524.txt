The hot flash, weight gain, forgetfulness part is all true. The rest is a little over the edge. But for me that is what makes a good book. If I wanted to read hard reality books, I would write one. I like to be entertained and this is exactly what this book did! A great, easy summer read for women over 40! So have fun with reading this book O' fellow menopause women!!
