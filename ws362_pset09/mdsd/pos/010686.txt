For me this book is wonderful and thriling, without question.  I only wish it could educate the mass public.  

Although very well written, the material will appeal mostly to a well educated reader and/or an intelligent person willing to grapple with a bit of political philosophy.  

So the book is intelligent; anything else?  It is a lot of fun, at least for someone like myself - long-ago a political science professor, who took one course (Cornell) with a Straussian disciple.  Ms. Norton was a grad student at the Univ. of Chicago and had numerous encounters with many of the main figures in the Struassian camp (grad school was as close to boot camp as most of them ever came).  She knew them without their rhetorical clothes, so to speak, and where they did not have the protection of high office and public relations staff.

What's a major "take home message" in this book?  The so-called neo-conservatives are not conservative in any historically meaningful sense of the term.  Also, they are dangerous ideologues (my opinion as well as the author's)
