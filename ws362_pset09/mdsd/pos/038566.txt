I'm biased here, OK, cuz I grew up w/the author & was there for a lot of this graphic novel as it happened...Shane paints a tough look back at growing up in our hometown in NNY.

The artwork is splendid and enhances the surreal moments of this tale & also never lets the reader leave the grip of the plot.  Be ready for some harsh, revealing story elements that are given a strange visual beauty in North Country.

Nice work, Shane!  More on the way??
