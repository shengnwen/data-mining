This is a book which, despite being written by a committee and showing it, has a definite point of view.  It is somewhat superficial, but contains a fairly good review of the literature on medical error and some definite  ideas about what to do.  This is the book for policy wonks who are  interested both in health care and in government intervention.  Those  looking for more in-depth treatment of the subject would do well to  consider Human Error in Medicine, edited by Marilyn Sue Bogner
