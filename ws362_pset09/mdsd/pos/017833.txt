Again, another good read from Ms. Wesley.  A great mystery story with chilling chapters.  Ms. Tamara Hayle is back on track with attempting to solve the murder of an old friend. This old friend and Tamara grew up together and remained friends until something very immature broke up their friendship.  Great story telling, I only wish that Tamara could find someone in her life to love, I was expecting "Basil" to return in this book, but to my surprise he didn't.  Jake, Tamara old friend, is still dropping by Tamara house to visit with her and her son, but it appears perhaps Jake may have found someone special.  In spite of Tamara love life, this is a good mystery story that all mystery lovers should enjoy
