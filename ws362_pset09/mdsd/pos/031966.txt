This is a small masterpiece of a book. &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot; is the place where the dreams and nightmares of all the citizens of the Ottoman Empire are obsessively examined by experts, looking for omens and potential threats to the state. This is the premise of this provocative, hallucinating voyage into the absurdity and ultimate terror of totalitarian power. &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot; is a powerful examination of fear and of the way it eventually turns a man's soul into stone, into another lifeless fragment of a monstrous sacrificial stone. A sinister allegory. A unique book. Don't miss it
