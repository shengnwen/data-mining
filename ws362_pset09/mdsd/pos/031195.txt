This book works well as a study guide for groups wanting to study Revalations. It's important to use the Bible in conjunction with this book.  Breaking The Code is more of a study guide than a book.  The suggested lesson plans in the back of the book are helpful, but reference a companion video which I could not locate. As with all books such as this: if you are looking for the book to speak to you, it won't.  But, hopefully while reading it, God will.
