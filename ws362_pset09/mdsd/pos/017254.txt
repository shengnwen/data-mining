As I usually find Velde's stories captivating, not only did I find this one just as good as the last ones, but I also found it very realistic to the world of RPGs.  Being a thirteen-year-old girl, you would not think that I'd enjoy many video games; quite the opposite.  I found this story was staying true to its roots, having a variety of monster's, characters and weapons.  The only thing I didn't get was the age limit on this; ages 9-12.  Not only does it have some explicit moments of violence, it also uses words I probably wouldn't have known back then.  Overall, good use of monsters, and fighting scenes.
