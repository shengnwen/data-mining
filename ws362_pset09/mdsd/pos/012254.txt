Unlike some previous reviewers, I very much appreciated getting to know Hem.  I found his story just as fascinating as his sisters.  Alison Croggan is really showing us how they are both part of this story and I am looking forward to the 4th novel.

This is an intelligent, well written & thoroughly engaging series
