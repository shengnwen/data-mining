A big storm rages through the night and causes lots of damage.  Bob and Wendy get the calls and they head out fix things.

At farmer Pickle's, a couple of the trucks notice the pond has to be cleaned out.  But before they can get started, Pilchard the cat climbs a shaky tree and gets stuck upside-down right over the pond.  The trucks rally with Bird to find Bob and Wendy.  But in the end all is well.

The book uses stills from the television show to illustrate the story.  Each page has one picture that fills the whole page except the bottom where the text is.  The text is a little clumsy.
