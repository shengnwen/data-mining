This poignant book is quite unique.  Written as a diary, and not intended to be published, Klemperer's book is like no other I have read in conveying the impact upon one couple of the Nazi's repressive regime. Virtually day after day, Klemperer recounts how he and his wife (who was not Jewish) bear the brunt of an endless array of irritating and debilitating Nazi policies.  For example, he loses his teaching position; he is divested of his car; his house is "rented" to an Aryan; the couple is forced to move into and share a home with other Jewish individuals; his bank accounts are frozen; the couple's food and clothing rations are cut; and on and on in and endless procession of indignities.  The human dimension of these repressive Nazi practices emerges with such startling force one simply is amazed that the couple surived at all.  A moving and valuable addition to the literature of the period
