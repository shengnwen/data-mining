Rescued From The Reich, by Bryan Mark Rigg, is the very well researched, well written story of how the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher Jews, Rebbe Joseph Schneersohn, members of his family, and some close associates were rescued from war torn Warsaw, with the help of some American officials, dedicated American Jews, and, believe it or not, a small group of German soldiers ably led by half Jew Ernst Bloch, a dedicated, professional soldier.  Bloch, whose application for Aryanization had been approved by Hitler himself, was a decorated soldier, who was working under the direction of Admiral Canaris, the head of the Abwehr.  He and a small group of other half Jewish soldiers were able to take the Rebbe and his group from Warsaw, through Berlin, to the Latvian border where they awaited the next leg of an amazing journey that would eventually lead them to America.  While all of this was taking place two very dedicated lawyers in the United States were trying to work through the anti-semitism of the State Department in order to arrange the necessary visas.  Along the way, the assistance of some very powerful members of the government is enlisted.  A very interesting and remarkable, yet probably mostly unknown story of WWII that is definitely worth reading.
