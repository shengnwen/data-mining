I had previously not read anything Jeffrey Steingarten had written.  After completing just the first essay in this volume of his collected columns, I realized my life had been the poorer for not reading his works before.  Steingarten enthralled me from the beginning.  Whether it is his quest to cook the perfect pizza, a huge undertaking including measuring temperatures in pizza ovens, timing baking, making exhaustive measurements in dough preparation (recipe included), his quest to make the ultimate hot chocolate (yes, recipe included), or his expose on whether there truly is a unique flavor to sea salt (no recipe included), Steingarten takes us on adventures we never knew existed, but now cannot do without.  He eats around the world (though in this book most often to France), and we mentally eat with him.  Steingarten is able to capture the essence of flavors, the excitement of discovering new foods, and the stories behind much of what we already eat.  His essays are populated with learned chefs, butchers, writers, farmers, almost all professions related to food.  There is never a dull moment in this highly entertaining and informative (a rare combination) book
