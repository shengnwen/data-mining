Sandstorm is a book about the waste environment, and it gives you everything you need to run or play in an arid or desert world, even on the outher planes. If you want to run an Al-Quadim style game, or a Darks Sun styled one, Sandstorm is for you.

Within the book, you will find the good old sections: races, prestige classes, feats, an in-depth description of the waste environment, great monsters and spells. 

The lowpoint of the book is perhaps the races section, which is - at least in my oppinion - quite unimaginative. 

The prestige classes presented in the book is quite good, but a bit more prestige classes would have been better than the new races.

The highpoint are the spells and the monsters section, which present lots of new opportunities and ideas. Within the book, one can also find lot's of descriptions of places that the DM can incorporate into his/her campaign with ease
