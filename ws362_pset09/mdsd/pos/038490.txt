When the UPS man delivered this I was shocked at how huge it is! Four big volumes packed with the most incredible and interesting mechanisms in the world. I have read the first book from cover to cover and I have thumbed through the rest. I love this kind of stuff so these are the perfect books for me. If you are also into cool mechanical contraptions, you will also love these books
