I am surprised that you are encouraging people to buy the two books, Infinite Grace and How People Heal--because these are, from what I can see, exactly the same book, with different titles.  This is an excellent book; but I can imagine the frustrations of those who followed your suggestion!

As a teacher of Therapeutic Touch (developed by Dora Kunz and Dr. Dolores Krieger), I found this a fascinating read. I rank it with another book that was published around the same time as Infinite Grace, Afterwards You're a Genius by Chip Brown.  For those of us who dwell in the realms addressed by the disciplines of "energy medicine," it is very helpful to have a body of literature about the various paths and personalities.  I hope that books like these help people to realize that there are indeed many and varied disciplines under the energy medicine umbrella, and that it is as important to seek out the appropriate modality for each person as it would be to find the MD with the appropriate specialty for a physical issue.

I give the present title 4 stars because I don't agree that the subtitle "exploring the scientific basis of subtle energy in Healing" is truly applicable to this book.  This claim would be more appropriate for a book like The Field by Lynn McTaggert.  Julia Benkofsky-Webb, Hawaii, USA(under the member name, Garrett Webb
