But this book is missing something.  It has plenty of drama, interesting sidebars, but I think a lot of it was rambling and Hemmingway didn't know where he was going with it.  Nevertheless, the tale of Harry Morgan's struggle to keep his family fed in corrupt Key West is interesting.  The dialog is powerful, particular in the bar scenes.  And Hemmingway's style of direct prose writing is entertaining.  You will feel the pain of the characters in this difficult story
