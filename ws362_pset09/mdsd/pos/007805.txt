Carolyn and Bob Mehaffy's Cruising Guide To The Hawaiian Islands comes from a couple who use San Francisco Bay as their port, and who set sail for Hawaii in 1996 after they retired. Upon their third voyage to the Hawaiian Islands they spent a year taking their boat into all the anchorages and harbors on each inhabited island: Cruising Guide To The Hawaiian Islands presents an island-by-island cruising guide, complete with maps and black and white photos. From approach advice to anchorage and facilities, any serious cruiser heading for Hawaii will want to take Cruising Guide along for the ride.
