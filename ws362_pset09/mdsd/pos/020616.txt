I have tried to analyze how it is that Sandoz manages to take a story, the  mere facts of which I have read many times, and make it so powerfully  moving that you find it haunting you long after the book is finished.   Besides her expert  ability to write in the language of her subjects, she  develops all characters to their fullest.  We follow them through their  every day lives, through their hopes and fears, and most of all through  their relationships to each other, until we feel we have become a part of  it all.  When lives end, usually tragically, we not only feel the loss  ourselves, but we grieve for the pain of those left behind.  When I read  Sandoz's biography of Crazy Horse, I felt each loss he felt, from the death  of his brother, to the agony of the decision to bring his followers into  the agency.  In this book, when the Cheyenne died in their last stand, I  felt as their survivors must have felt, both grieved at the loss, but proud  that they had died fighting in the tradition of their people, Also, once  again as with Crazy Horse, I felt, as no simple telling of the facts could  get across, what a great mistake it was not to let these cultures survive,  and how foolish and arrogant the whites were to  spend lives, money and  ammunition to keep a few hundred impoverished people from returning to  their homeland
