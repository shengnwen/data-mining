Some may not consider this one of her best, indeed, it isn't listed as a fav anywhere, but it had enough Nora magic to introduce me to the woman and hook me into devouring everything I could there after.

Pacing was good, twists were good and I was right there in Hollywood, the forest, everywhere her characters were. Detail in descirbing the forests got a little bogged down but I waded through it.

I cried at the end - a first for me! ( Until I read her other books)

I wouldn't read this first, if you're just discovering Nora. There are other books that put the awe in awesome. Check those out then come to this one
