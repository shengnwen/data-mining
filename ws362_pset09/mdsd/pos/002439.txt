This book is a wonderful resource for Pastors!  When  I wrote &quot;Battered But Not Broken: Help For Abused Wives And Their Church Families&quot; in 1996 (see my booklisting on Amazon.com) I was very  concerned about the lack of appropriate information available for the  Church.  Little by little, more books have been written on the topic of  domestic violence within the Faith community. Everyone who works with  victims of domestic violence within a Church setting should read this book!
