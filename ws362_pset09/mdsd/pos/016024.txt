I was turned off by the idea of &quot;slogans,&quot; and did not read this book the first few times I came across it.  However, when I began studying Tong Len, (Unconditional Giving and Taking during the In and Out breath), I found several pages of very good commentary on Tong Len in this book.  The slogan says something like, &quot;Unconditional Giving rides the Out Breath, Unconditional Taking rides the In Breath.&quot;  but when you read what all this means, it is truly the essence of buddhism.    (I think this slogan originates from the Way Of The Bodhisattva or Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life by Santideva or Shantideva, which is an excellent book in any of the several English translations now available.)    Chogyam Trungpa can be flippant and condescending, which he calls &quot;heavy handed,&quot; and explains as a form of compassion.  This may or may not be accurate.  As a reader, take the parts of this book that resonate with your inner compassion, and let the other parts lie
