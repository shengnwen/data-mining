As a PMP certified project manager and instructor, I found the book extremely (pardon the pun) helpful in addressing the issues for IT projects. Handling the adaptive/agile world of for instance software development isn't PMBOK-able at all times.  The balance of the book - being mostly PMI and a tad new stuff - is great!  Also a very good chapter on Critical Chain (I absolutely hate Goldrat's novel-like books, takes too long to get to the point).
Great work, guys!
