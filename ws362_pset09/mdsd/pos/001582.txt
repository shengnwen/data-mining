     The thing that interested me in reading this book was Nash's battle with insanity and his obsession with seeing hidden messages from aliens in publictions. I had expected much of this to have been discussed in more depth but the book really focuses on Nash's college studies and career as a mathmatical genius. Most people will probably want to buy and read this book for exactly what it is and not for the story of aliens and insanity for which I bought the book. Though the book was not what I had hoped it to be for my own personal interest I have to give it a 5 star review because I think it's exactly what the average person buying the book would expect it to be.
