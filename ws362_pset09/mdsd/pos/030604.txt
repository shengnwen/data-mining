This book was too hard to put down.  My sister bought it and read it in a day and said the book was good.  I read it after her and she was right about that.  The author with her social knowledge of the French, made it entertaining and worthwhile to read.  Imagine yourself in Paris at a cafe by yourself elegantly dressed and calm and by chance a man seeks your affections.  This book was a breath of fresh air as to how French women celebrate their feminity and embrace life.  They don't let the little stuff worry them like some of us do.  While I was reading this book, I felt a bit more satisfied with who I am and how I should celebrate myself as a woman
