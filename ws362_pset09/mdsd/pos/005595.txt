Synopsis of Early Modern Spain starting with Ferdinand and Isabella through Phillip II.  Not the most in-depth or inclusive book on the subject, but has enough to get a person started.  This book is blander than other history books I have read, but if you can make it through, it will give you a good grasp on Spain at its highest point.
