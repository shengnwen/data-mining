As long as you are searching for this book, you are interested in western moral philosophy. I still have to find someone who would take one of Kant's volumes out of his own accord and gaze at that person with wonder and amazement.

But, if you are starting with Kant you are making the mistake. For understanding of Kantinan revolution you have to know at least fundaments of other moral philosophies, especially those of Plato and Aristotle. Again, I cannot offer any kind of rating about this particular translation, if you can read German I sincerely recommend reading this work on it. 

Kantian question of method, which he discusses in the third and closing part of this book is maybe one of the most challenging adventures in moral philosophy. Philosophers before Kant stated what is good and than proposed how to achieve that state, whatever it was. Kantian method is quite contrary and Kant himself pinpoints on this. First, there is a method, and by following that method we will be/act good.

There is much too little space here to elaborate all of Kantian concepts and there are much to discuss. Including existence of free will in world of causalities, hypothetical and categorical  imperatives and such. Don't be driven back by sometimes harsh language that Kant uses. Under there lies one of the greatest thoughts of western civilisation.
