I thought the Fifties were a dull, dead backwater  until I read this marvelous book.  Wakefield's writing is so vivid, visceral and impassioned that you feel what it was like to be suddenly set loose in a place of magic  and endless possibility.  I particularly loved his account of sexuality and  psychoanalysis, of the dance between male and female in those hours just  before the revolution.  This book made me wish I'd been in New York at that  time, but reading about it from Wakefield is the next best thing
