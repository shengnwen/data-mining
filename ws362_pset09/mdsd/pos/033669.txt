&quot;The Blue Fairy Book&quot; is amazing.  I am planning to collect all of Andrew Lang's color fairy tale books.  It has an excellent group of stories from different fairy tale writers, including Perrault, d'Aulnoy,  and Grimm.  This book was originally printed in the 19th century.  It has  not been abridged, nor have any of the original pictures been taken out.   (Be warned, they're *artistic*)  These are the original, unaltered by  Disney versions, and contain the nightmarish plots they were meant to have.   Anyone who collects fairy tales should have this
