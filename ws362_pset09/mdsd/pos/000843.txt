I am slowly moving through this tome, enjoying every moment spent there. This text, now in 2nd edition (2004), is an excellent overview of many psychological aspects of the human mind. It is clearly written. Articles pertaining to scientific studies of the mind, and psychology of human behavior, are thoroughly researched; helpful bibliographies provide a stimulus to "dig deeper." This book deserves a place next to other psych-related texts in your personal library
