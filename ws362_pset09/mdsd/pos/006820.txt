What a fortunate man Martin Nanther was to be in possession of his anscestor's belongings which set him on an amazing journey of discovery about his past and himself. Betrayal, hypocrasy and greed set the scene for this tantalising tale surrounding several generations of people who have all been caught up, in one way or the other, in the driving force of one man; hence through his want of recognition he unknowingly creates a series of "unspeakable" events that harrowly effects each branch of his descendants. From the foundation of a family's history  another story unfolds which questions the rites of passage and parenting while delivering an informative account about haemophelia. Being a genealogist I was drawn to the dynamics of every aspect of this book. I woke at night to read it and was dissapointed when it ended. Having said that, I guessed the outcome. This book will be included in my favourite list along with "My Brother Jack" by George Johnston and "Victim of the Aurora" by Tom Keneally
