"The Longest War" by Dilip Hiro provides a thorough political history of the Iran-Iraq conflict.  Those with little to moderate exposure to the war will probably find it interesting, while more knowledgeable students of the era will most likely gain little insight, as it is largely based on press clippings.  

Readers of other military histories will be disappointed to find a lack of primary evidence into motives; however, it is important remember that such evidence was not available at the time of publication, as it is with, for example, a history of World War II.

One interesting factor about this book is that it was (apparently) written prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1991.  This has positive and negative effects.  For instance:

(1) Hiro does not have the benefit of being able to use future events to improve his analysis.  For example, given the later invasion of Kuwait, Sadaam Hussein's invasion of Iran seems much more like a megalomaniac stab at natural resources (and their commensurate power) than the establishment of a bulwark against Shi'ite Islamism.

(2) Hiro's analysis does not suffer from bias created by later events.  For example, American support of the Iraqi regime in the latter stages of the war is presented in the context of (a) Cold War competition with the Soviet Union, (b) protecting American interests in the gulf states from Iranian interference and (c) the political climate in America following the Iran-Contra affair.  Today, it is common to see such support described as misguided or even hypocritical, given what happened in 1990-1 and in 2003.  Hiro lays out reasons for American support to Iraq that were indeed very rational given what was known to American policymakers at the time.
