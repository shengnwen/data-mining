The deep suspicions harbored by Hailey Sutter towards her immediate family members on the mysterious death surrounding her mother is expertly crafted to keep the readers on edge for the major portion of the plot. Its intriguing to readers why on earth  Hailey's father failed to communicate any knowledge of the whereabouts of Hailey's elder brother & sister after more than 20 years. 

Just when you think it may sound too preposterous an idea that a close family member whom you live with fail to disclose their whereabouts and were not declared missing even on police records, the plot regains credibility when Hailey investigates for herself and finds the spouses of her missing brother & sister. It is through the spouses that Hailey gains a better insight into her long lost siblings. Hailey finds out through letters sent to her former family maid, Della, that her elder sister is mentally disturbed having been institutionalized at some point after high school.

Just when the plot was building nicely towards the resolution, the events that unfolded in the last chapter canceled out the suspense. What was so infuriating was the far fetched revealation of who did what to whom and the need to keep Hailey in the dark about the mystery of her immediate family members!!

On the whole, it is a readable suspense novel except for the ending
