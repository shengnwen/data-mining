How do we find the origins of anything?  In mythology and folklore, there have been attempts to use language and the narratives themselves to recreate the origins.  Others attempt to apply pyschological theory to explain the commonness of &quot;man's mythic past&quot; -- &quot;man&quot; here a term purposely chosen to reflect the patriarchical veil that most studies have processed the world through.  Marcel Detienne does some of these things in his search for the origins of Greek mythology -- the term &quot;mythology&quot; is used as a general word and does not reflect later attempts to classify and identify different type of narratives.  While I may not agree with all of his statements and the translation leaves a bit ot be desired (as all translations due I might add), I am very pleased as a historian to say that Detienne has no problem saying flat out &quot;we may never know&quot; the origins of Greek mythology.  This may leave many readers at a loss if the book was chosen to give all the answers but it is a far more realistic approach that attempts to create what can never be uncovered and to understand what has no record
