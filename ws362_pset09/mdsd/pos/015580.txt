This is a fine work by Thomas Cutler that explains in great detail the Battle of Leyte Gulf.  The explanation of Japanese and American ship positions and information from sailors who were actually in this battle  make this a very special book.  This book highlights the real strength of  the U.S Navy at this point in time.  That is, the core values of the U.S.  Navy, honor, courage, and commitment.  While the U.S. destroyers Hoel,  Johnston, and Samuel B. Roberts were sinking many acts of bravery were  witnissed. To a man, they never let their shipmates down. That is the  highest compliment one navy man can give to another.  Thomas Cutler also  explains some of the reasoning for the japanese withdrawl when complete  victory was at hand for them. A must book to read for anyone interested in  the U.S Navy and to learn more about a very special type of bravery that is  only present in the U.S. Navy
