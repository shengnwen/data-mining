Compiled and edited by Martha Joynt Kumar (Department of Political Science, Towson University) and Terry Sullivan (Department of Political Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), The White House World: Transitions, Organization, And Office Operations is an imposing collection of scholarly essays by a variety of learned authors. Drawing from interviews with seventy-five former senior White House officials representing six administrations (as well as with former President Gerald Ford), to present a picture as assembled by top political scientists of what really goes on in the White House West Wing, The White House World would well serve future White House administrations seeking practical advice on how best to organize their presidencies. Topics scrutinized include the mechanics of Presidential transition, the role of various offices such as Press Secretary or The Office of Communication, and a special focus upon President George W. Bush's transition. A worthy glimpse of the workings of American government itself, The White House World is an invaluable contribution to Political Science reference collections and reading lists
