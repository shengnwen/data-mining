I agree with the previous reviewer. The techniques in this book are great. And most of the designs are to my taste -- none of them look as if they are really for old hippies with their hair up in buns, too often the image presented by shawls.  The caveat with this book is that all the yarns called for are extemely expensive. I am not sorry I bought this book but I don't think I will be knitting anything in the yarn specified
