Lee Edwards has always done a wonderful job writing the history and biographies of many of the key players that made conservatism what it is.  Unfortunately, trying to cram the events and people that made conservatism  what it is, even by only focusing on four of those players, tends to  obscure the individual strengths and weaknesses of those players.  I  commend Edwards for his effort in writing this book.  God knows that  conservatism has not received its due attention by historians. And as  usual, Edwards' book is very readable and informative.  However, in my  opinion, his time would be better spent continuing to write about the  individual heroes of conservatism rather than trying to summarize the  movement
