I shopped very carefully to find a book which would help decode the economic names, ideas and systems which are so important today's world, yet so inaccessible to the non-economist.   I was looking to find a book which would discuss the economists and their theories without a heavy liberal slant.   

This book scores on every possible point.  It would make an excellent college textbook.  It is well layed out with many insets, biographical sketches, etc.  The text itself is engaging and sometimes humourous, and perhaps most uniquely, it tells a story.  It tells the story of economics as a battle for freedom fought in lofty ideas by academics but with deep and real consequeces.   I would absolutely recommend this book to any person looking for an intoduction into the story of economics.  It will prove invaluable to your understanding of life.
