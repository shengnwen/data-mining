Readers looking for the roots of difficulties that still plague the U.S. will find the perfect precis in A SHORT HISTORY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION. Civil rights freed of racial or gender limitations, race relations, states' rights versus federal laws, the rise of financial and business trusts, the foundations for all these &quot;modern&quot; issues are succinctly excavated and eloquently put on display by Foner in this great book. Should be required reading. Bravo
