Having first gotten to know The White Dog Cafe in my frequent meals there during college, I was delighted (understatement) to find that the restaurant had its own cookbook. The book, which is a solid thickness with plenty of recipe options, is one of my very favorites. There are items that are more complicated and others that are perfect for a backyard BBQ. Variety being key and inside bits of information adding to the richness of this book. For instance, in a recipe calling for fresh artichokes, the page would give you a little information on cleaning fresh artichokes. The kind of background many cooks need and most cookbooks neglect to offer. I would give this cookbook a five-star rating, but I am allergic to about 25% of its recipes so I can't say how great those are. Those I've tried, however, are yummy (never any leftovers) and popular with kids and adults alike
