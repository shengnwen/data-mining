I don't know where Vintage International gets off blazoning the cover with the words:  "A New Translation . . . by John E. Woods".  Sheesh.

Woods's translation is not new, folks, at least not to Vintage International.  It first came out in 1996 and they used it then in a slightly different edition.

Yes, it is EXACTLY the same translation of the previous Vintage International edition of "The Magic Mountain," which you may have seen in its previous incarnation:  it had exactly the same weight and size as this does but a bluish cover.  It has not been revised or amended or anything.

I'm not saying Woods's is a bad translation or anything; it's just that it seems like with this slick new cover the folks at Vintage International are trying to get us Mann aficionados all in a bother by letting on like they have replaced some old stuffy translation [which saddled their older bluish edition] with this exciting new one, which you can obtain if you only purchase this new golden edition!

Malarkey.  They're both the same John E. Woods translation.

Just for clarification: the previous translation used by Vintage was the Lowe-Porter job (last issued by Vintage in 1992), which by now has come to be universally regarded as inferior to Woods's 1996 production, even though the author, Mann himself, assisted Lowe-Porter on some translations (including "Der Zauberberg") before Mann's death in 1955.

Anyhow.  You're always safe with Woods.

Sorry.  Guess this wasn't a "quick note" after all
