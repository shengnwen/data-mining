Living in Arizona, I did not read Royko as often as others.  However, when his column started to appear in local papers, I looked forward to each one.  My only disappointment with this book was it did not contain my favorite Royko column:  he wrote about the injustice labeling big guys as bullies when they simply defend themselves against pint-sized runts.   Anyway, the book is still outstanding because Royko was unpredictable in his opinions
