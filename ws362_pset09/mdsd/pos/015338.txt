Martinez' title sells, 2 years then a million bucks...and he shows you by example of the title being reality, which is good...one downside though, is that it takes very hard work, so much so that you may have to ignore your family and personal life..overall a great read, inspiring, but just be sure you know what your goals are. For another real estate title, I also read Investing With out Losing by Saus
