Fairy godmother Desiderata has died without really training a successor. In a last moment note, she bequeaths her fairy godmothering-wand to Magrat Garlick, and arranges matters so that Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax will help Magrat out. As a result, the entire coven is off to Genua. The witches are indeed abroad.

Fairy godmothers always come in pairs, and the other fairy godmother is Lilith, Granny Weatherwax's sister, who ran off some years ago after some Trouble, leaving Granny to be the Good Witch. Lilith has used the power of story - and extravagant use of mirror magic - to transform Genua into a kind of vicious fairy tale city. Magrat, Nanny and Granny must stop Emberella from kissing the Duc, or everyone will live Happily Ever After. Whether they want to or not.

Pratchett detests people who use people for their own ends. And Lilith uses the power of story to make people do what she wants, whether they like it or not. Emberella is destined to kiss the Duc whether she wants to or not, even though the Duc is creepy, has cold hands, an impossibly long tongue and eats flies. So while there may not be Black Magic and White Magic on the Discworld, there is Good and Evil, and Lilith, trying to control the lives of others, is Evil. 

Like all Pratchett novels, this one will reduce you to helpless laughter. There are sly references to other fantasies (including an appearance by Gollum), multi-lingual puns (Nanny Ogg speaking Foreign), and an extended cameo by Greebo, Nanny's over-sexed tom cat. But as entertaining as "Witches Abroad" may be, like all later Pratchett books, there are thoughtful questions behind all that laughter. "Good," Pratchett demonstrates, is not the same as "Sweet,"  or even "Nice." No one writing today combines hysterically funny writing with thoughtful social commentary as well as Terry Pratchett. In Esmerelda Weatherwax he has created one of the great characters in fantasy. Very highly recommended.
