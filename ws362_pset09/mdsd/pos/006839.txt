I found Shadow Baby to be a very engrossing story.  Right from the very beginning, the "voice" of the little girl pulled me in.  I wanted to know what happened to her baby sister, what happened to her father, grandfather...what would become of her friendship with "the old man".  

We find Clara winter, our narrator, a very unique 11 year old.  Her thoughts and actions are really more that of a 18 year old.  However for me, I didn't mind, I just accepted this and read on.  Clara is a girl who is questioning life.  She wants to know what happened to her twin sister who died at birth, what the real story was.  She tries to get her mother to give her answers on that & other subjects, most of the time to no avail.  So she develops a friendship with an older neighbor and this seems to give her a bit of an outlet and she begins making up stories about her families life, and his life.  

This book is unique in that it takes you on a journey, and you're not sure where this is leading a lot of the time.  You want answers, the answers Clara is seeking, and you wonder if you'll ever get them.  Or if you'll ever find out why Clara is the way she is.  Over-all I enjoyed the "journey", I'm still left with a few questions...but this is definitely a book I won't forget any time soon
