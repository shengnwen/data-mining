I've read many books on dealing with parent issues and this is one of the best, mainly because the author explains why we do not have to "forgive" our parents. Sometimes it's impossible. There are good examples of toxic parent/child relationships that deal with emotional and verbal abuse, not just the more egregious sexual abuse. Reading about the lives of other people and their parents will help many people realize they are not alone and that they too can overcome any difficulties with their parents - either by developing a more mature and healthy relationship or just learning to let them go.
