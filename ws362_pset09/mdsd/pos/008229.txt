I am a musical theatre major at the University of Oklahoma, and I purchased this book for a class on auditions. I found however it was a much better read than a standard text book. Mr. Oliver presents a large amount of very useful tips and techniques while keeping the book very "readable". The stories he recalls from his experience provide an insight into the art of auditioning, and they    prove quite amusing for anyone who has been through the ringer of an audition on any scale. The book clips along quickly and by the time you are finished you are sure to have a smile on your face and many useable pieces of information in your head
