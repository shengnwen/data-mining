Having never been to France (or Europe for that matter) I am not qualified to say weather this book accurately describes Provence or not. However, the wit and style of Mayle's writing is enough in itself to carry the book. I thoroughly enjoyed Mayle's description of everyday life, the character of the French people, and of course the food.  

Mayle takes us into his world of moving to the South of France with his wife and purchasing an old provencial house. He is submerged in a culture that is fascinating on every level. Visions of biking under cherry trees bursting with blossoms, unending goblets of wine, and lavender infused air all drenched in golden sunlight make Provence sound like the promised land to this Alaskan girl! 

Mayle has tact at describing even the simplest of details which may be taken for granted if you happen to experience them yourself, but I have been unsuccessful at growing lavender in my garden (which is an annual in Alaska) and there are no sun soaked vineyards for me to experience where I live so I loved reading about them.

My only frustration with this book is that French words are not translated and I can't find out what the heck marc is? I know it's a drink but what kind of drink? Is it like wine or what? I figured out that pastis is made from anise and I will try some...

My greatest hunger after reading this book is to savior the experience myself!
