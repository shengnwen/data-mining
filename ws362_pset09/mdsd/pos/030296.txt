"Is Wal-Mart god or bad?  The answer is surprising for both its simplicity and also for its power:  Wal-Mart is something utterly new."  (pg. 221)

Having gone through a good deal of information on the Wal-Mart phenomenon, I found this book to be something many other books have not been...objective.  I am no lover of the store and its practices, but it was refreshing to read from an author who did not appear to have an "agenda" on the subject.  That said, I was reading intently to find out what conclusions he reached.  Partly, Fishman believes that until Wal-Mart starts disclosing its numbers to the world, we cannot clearly know what its impact is.  That in itself is not exactly mind-blowing stuff, but if the real point of writing the book is to let us know that the impacts of this corporation are indeed far reaching, Fishman succeeds.  

Most of America shops and lives without thinking of the long term consequences of their buying habits, good or bad.  This book takes a well-informed look at many different perspectives on the giant and why it is really so different from previous or concurrent mega-corporations...and why it matters.
