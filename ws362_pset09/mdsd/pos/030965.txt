Excellent textbook on competitive strategy using an economics approach. The first edition complemented my business and economics studies at grad school. Includes a chapter on regulatory (public policy) impacts on business; a topic usually missing from strategy texts. Shows how a 'bill becomes a law' from the business/market perspective
