I love the New Yorker cartoons, and I love puzzles - so this is a perfect combination.  I bought four of the books.  One for myself, and three to give as gifts for Christmas.  They are bound very nicely, in the spiral manner that allows the book to stay open as you solve it.  The production values are very good overall.

I just saw Word Play with Will Shortz who wrote the forward for this book, and must say he aligns himself with winners (I am a New York Times crossword puzzle fan, in addition to loving New Yorker cartoons.
