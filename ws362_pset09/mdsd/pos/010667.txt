More similar in its simplicity to a Princess of Mars than Gods/Warlord.  John Carter's son engages in search for abducted Thuvia, while he remains the prime suspect in her abduction.  Usual strange meetings and stranger neighborhoods, but this story is a little less frenentic than Gods/Warlord, and both Carthoris and Thuvia are solid characters
