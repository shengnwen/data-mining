Loh's delicious use of language enticed me into the heartbreaking world of Singapore on the brink of WWII.  Painful and beautiful, BREAKING THE TONGUE is a mirror reflecting the best and worst of humanity.  The passages weaving in the philosphies of Sun Tzu and martial arts are moments of grounding/hope/centering in a novel dealing with physical and emotional chaos and conflict.  This book's a keeper
