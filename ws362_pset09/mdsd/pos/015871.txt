This is a remarkable book.  It is primarily a think piece, but it is one that knits together an extraordinary amount of research and a large number of topics in political science that rarely meet.  Schier's basic argument is that piecemeal attempts to correct problems in American elections -- problems such as the Electoral College, campaign financing, and incoherent voter initiatives and referenda -- will not go nearly as far in inspiring political participation as will a rethinking of the plurality-winner voting rules that we use to select our political leaders.  This would be a provocative book for stimulating discussion in upper-level undergraduate political science courses and introductory graduate courses.  Political scientists looking for ideas and resources for studying a wide variety of electoral issues will also find much here.  This is a valuable and timely work
