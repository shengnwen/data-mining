I LOVE this book.  It has become, over the years, one of my favorite dessert books.  There are several recipes that I (or my girls) have made over and over and they have now become favorites.  My kids' teachers drool over the cookies in their lunch boxes, and have requested them for their class parties.  Some of our "tried and true" recipes include the Road Trip Cookies, Chocolate Oatmeal Roundup Cookies, Chocolate Boulders, Mrs. D's Chocolate Chip Cookies, Franny's Big Bottom Pies (which I also made ice cream sandwiches from), White Chocolate Snow Caps, and Chocolate Hazelnut Espresso Biscotti.  I have had only one recipe to be a total bust, and that was the fudge.  All in all, though, I feel confident that when I try a new recipe, it will work.  My only caution would be in his recommendations for salt--to my taste it is a little too much and I usually cut the amount called for in half and I find it to be just right
