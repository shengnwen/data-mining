Some of stuff Jenny writes in this book is even more crude and raunchy then in her past books so some of the parts I skipped. I don't think it was as good as her first two books so I gave this book 4 stars. But, it is still a very funny book and it's worth reading. If you liked her other two books then you will like this one if you didn't then don't bother to get this book because you really won't like it. I still enjoyed this book. I just started reading All the days of my life (so far) by Alison Sweeney.
