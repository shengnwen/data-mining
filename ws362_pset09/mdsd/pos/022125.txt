I read this book with enthusiasm and a new understanding of many of the integral Buddhist concepts - even after having practiced Buddhism for many years. The author brings some difficult and confusing Buddhist tenets home and applies them to modern day examples which are easy to understand and grasp. My husband, a non-Buddhist, found the book quite lucid, persuasive and enlghtening. Anyone who is interested in an "update" and modern day application of this precious ancient philosophy will delight in and learn much from this book!
