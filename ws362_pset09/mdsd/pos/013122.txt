This book is an excellent guide into the world of vegetarianism.  It offers delicious recipes, loads of information on good nutrition for the vegan, and is written in a humourous, easy-to-read style.   The authors  give great basic instruction on making meals healthy and balanced, making  it simple to take off from there and get creative in the kitchen.  I have  literally worn out three copies of this book over the years, and highly  recommend it
