This was assigned reading in a Native American Literature class I was enrolled in a few years ago.  I have come back to the book twice since then, finding great enjoyment.  The character Edgar Bearchild is an enchanting protagonist with the best of intentions and a terribly misguided soul.  The opening of the book reveals this--during his first experience with tribal psychedelics intended for serious use, but approached by Ted and Edgar with less-than-pure interest.  The book gives its readers a good idea of what reservation life has been like throughout the middle of the 20th century, how institutions have failed the dwindling and seemingly suicidal societies they are meant to serve.

While this book it technically autobiographical (or so a few libraries I've visited have said), there's obviously something to be learned.  However, you will not be left hungry for entertainment.  "Black Eagle Child" is a journey wrought with comical run-ins and slip-ups, heavy alcohol consumption, drug consumption and rock-and-roll.  Since the characters are teenagers, these elements should be expected.  And while they come up often, they do not surface without the rightful ponderings that should result from contact with such items in a teenager's life.

Lessons are learned, laughs are had, and ultimately there are truths revealed in this book.  I am stunned that this is only the 2nd review posted here on Amazon for this wonderful book.  It's truly an enjoyable read
