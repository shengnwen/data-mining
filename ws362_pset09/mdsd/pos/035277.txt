I have been a fan of AUDIE MURPHY, since I saw the movie &quot;THE DUEL AT SILVER CREEK&quot; in the late fifties at a theater in Denmark, it was not shown here until then, but living here, and collecting filmstars at that  time was a very tough hobby, because we did not see much material. However,  I was very happy to learn from a friend, that a book was finally written  about him, and I must say, that it has everything. A complete  film-biography, with a very good picture from each one of them, together  with his efforts under WW2, and what followed of honours etc. Besides all  that, the author has even included poems and songs written by Audie, just  amazing! In all, a great book, told by a very good author. Can only be  recommended to all AUDIE MURPHY fans
