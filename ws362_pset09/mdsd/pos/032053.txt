Something was missing for me in the historical recount.

She meets her 90 year old mother in a nursing home and starts asking very leading questions that suggest she should feel pity (whether she should or shouldn't isn't the point) when I was just waiting for her to head in the direction of how her mother came to believe in the nazi lifestyle in the first place.  The previous reviewer is right, they pick right up where she leaves her children and joins the SS party and is viewed as a monster but I think it's responsible to attempt to understand humanity's motives and find out what the catalyst was to her drastic life change.  There are even hints that she missed her old life terribly but these reasons are not explored, only pondered over by the writer in hindsight.  As the famous saying goes, if you neglect to understand these situations, however painful they may be, history may repeat itself.

Overall, it was a very good read but the detail above it why I'm giving it 4 stars
