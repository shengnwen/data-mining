Lee McKinney has a full life, between being the accountant for her aunt's chocolate business and trying to decide if she wants to marry her boyfriend Joe.  All of this becomes more complicated, however, when Aubrey Andrews Armstong, a supposed Hollywood producer, comes to town to investigate the possibility of making a movie based on a book written by Maia Michaelson, a local woman.  Lee knows that Maia is not a very good writer, and is suspicious of Aubrey's motives.  She becomes even more unhappy when if appears that Aubrey is attempting to romance Lee's Aunt Nettie.  As if this isn't bad enough, Joe begins to pressure her about helping him make 
choices in redecorating his apartment, so that she will be more eager to marry him and move in with him.  Needless to say, many chocolate bonbons and quite a bit of action later, Lee manages to get some answers to these problems.  I especially enjoy the setting of these books because it is close to my hometown and is an area with which I am very familiar.  This is an enjoyable series and is one that I look forward to reading more of in the future
