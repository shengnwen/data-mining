Not knowing I was about to read two books with similar storylines, I picked up "The Testament" by John Grisham and "Morning Noon & Night" by Sidney Sheldon.  After reading the first, I went right into the second book and for 95% of the story was hooked.  It was the conclusion that did me in.  Harry Stanford, billionaire, dies in a boating accident, falling off the deck of his yacht, the result of rough, choppy waters.  He is survived by his three children, Judge Tyler Stanford, Kendall Stanford Renaud and Woodrow (Woody) Stanford who all have their own demons to fight and the inheritance would greatly chase away many of those demons.  Along comes Julia Stanford, illegitimate daughter of Harry and another heir to the estate.  The story takes its twists and turns with serious intrigue and deadly maneuvers plotted out in order to destroy Julia and cut her out of her share of the estate.  Tyler needs to hold on to his lover, Lee, who definitely likes the finer things that big money can buy, Kendall and her husband, Marc, could use the money to pay off her anonymous blackmailer once and for all, and Woody and Peggy would definitely benefit by it in order to help Woody kick his heroin addiction.  They have paid their dues growing up with a father's vindictive treatment, something Julia did not have to endure.  Who is out to get Julia?  Is Julia really Julia or just another greedy gold digger?  The reader is astute to the true villain, however, he/she is very smart and his/her plan seems iron clad until the end when all unravels very quickly in a matter of just a few pages.  Considering the amount of intrigue and resolution needed to be accomplished, this story would definitely had been a five-star novel had that one element had been expounded upon.
