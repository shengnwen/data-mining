There are reasons why it is difficult to review a book like this.  First, it is a translation so it is hard to tell whether problems with prose belong to the author or the translator.  Second, it is a Holocaust memoir which means criticizing it feels like criticizing the author's experiences.  And yet, if we are going to do justice to any piece of writing, a reader has to be willing to be honest about his reactions to it.  My reaction is simple: I think this is a good piece of writing but not a great one.

Despite it's brevity, I found this a very difficult book to get through.  I wanted very much to be moved by Levi's experiences but it wasn't until the final section, "The Story of Ten Days," that I really felt emotion--that I connected to the author's fight for survival.  Most of the time I felt detached because the writing felt very clinical to me.  Unlike Elie Weisel's Night, for example, a memoir I've read many times, which grabs me from the first page and doesn't let go.

This is not to discount the horror of Auschwitz's nor Levi's obvious suffering.  I guess it's just that, strange as it may sound, I want to be drawn into the author's horror and share his plight.  I rarely had that feeling here.  However, there is no doubt that this book offers a unique insight into the Auschwitz experience and cannot be discounted.  Anyone interested in trying to understand the insanity that was the Holocaust needs to read it
