I have enjoyed nearly everything these co-authors have written, and this book is no exception except that it takes the reader to new heights of suspence. The Pendergast characters have both been developed so that now we can see more clearly into their very strange, eerie world. I would recommend first reading "Relic" to gain a little background on the museum and some of the characters, but that's not essential. This book can stand on it's own
