The reviews already here aren't lying--I found the reviews to be accurate--the book is excellent.  It covers the whole island from a the point of view of someone who has lived here long enough to know the best areas.  Photographically, the images, hints and location information is very helpful.  The book is so good I am considering buying it for folks looking to visit Oahu (just moved there).  Highly Recommended
