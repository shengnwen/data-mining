Both sides of time is about a young girl who lives in the 1900's but is taken back in time to the 1890's. When she goes back in time she falls in love with a boy and has a romantic relationship with him. But they both have a big problems they can't have a relationship because they live in totally different times. Not only that they both have other people that they once loved. 
I really thought this book was very good I enjoyed it a lot. It is actually one of my most favorite books. The author is a great writer she did a wonderful job describing things in the book. You would think it would be hard to understand certain things in the book having it cast in a totally different time but the way the author words things it helps you to understand the book well. Another thing I thought was great about this book is it is not very hard to read actually not hard at all. It was actually fun to read you just always wanted to know what is going to happen next. I never wanted to put the book down. Another great thing about the book is that you learn quite a bit about the 1800's I learned a lot of new things I didn't know. So not only is it fun to read you also learn! One reason I think I liked the book is because it related to me it was about a girl a little bit older than me but I still had things that I could relate with her.  I think this book is mainly written for girls because it has quite a bit of romance in it but I guess it wouldn't be too bad if a boy wanted to read it. Not only does the book have some romance it also has mystery and a little suspense to it. The only thing that is kind of bad is at the end. You want to know what is going to happen but that actually that is not a bad thing at all that just means I need to read the sequel! 
I would encourage anyone that wants to read a romance story to read Both Sides of Time and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed it!
