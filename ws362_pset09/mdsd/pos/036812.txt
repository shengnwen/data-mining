Now I do not need 1000 words as I am allowed but I can sum this whole review up in less than 1000.  I feel that Steven W. Mosher is deadly truthful through out &quot;Hegemon&quot;.  It is terrifying to know that now after reading this, that it is all true.  All the peices fit together in a puzzle that China seems to have going for them.  If you look deeper into the lines written and take the time to think about what Mosher is saying it turns on a light to make you think.  I feel that it is terrifying because to know that there CAN exist a country so overpowered by the quest for power that they have the potential to overthrow any nation.  This includes the United States of America.  Everyone that I have spoken to in the past say that China is like a 3rd world country. That that have no potential to evern match the United States.  But if any of them read what China has been doing for all these years they would come to realize that they DO, CAN, and WILL overthrow any and all nations, that is if we don't open our eyes. Is it right?  NO.  Is it all true?  YES!  So Mr. Mosher my hats off to you for opening my eyes to the past, the present, and possibaly the future if we are too ingorant to do anything about it
