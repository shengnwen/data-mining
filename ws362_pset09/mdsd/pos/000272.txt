When it comes to my kitchen calendar, I usually get stuck with whatever somebody gave me (my mechanic offered me one this year, I was SO GLAD to be able to tell him I already had one), or if I can, I go for some landscapes, but I saw the Secret Garden Calendar and it just seemed so lovely and soothing and happy, that I intend to enjoy it this year and not ever be stuck with a calendar from the drycleaners ever again. I wanted images that would bring enjoyment to my day, and this certainly is a good step in that direction
