I happened upon this book at work over seven years ago and started it for lack of reading material.  This book started my education into the world of the World War II.  Ambrose not only tells you what happened in a time line that is easy to follow, he tells you about life for the average infantryman in the war.  It is a must read for anyone studying the war, or a soldiers life in any war, for a hobby or for education.  I have given this book as a gift to friends and family members who show an interest in World War II, and I consider it the best World War II book I have read to date after now reading over a hundred other books on this war and soldier's lives in battle.  This book and Band of Brothers are by far my favorite two books on the subject
