Brilliant, Original, Persuasive, Catastrophic & Inspiring,

Lovelock is evolutionary intuitive `geophysiologist & planetary doctor", similar in philosophy to deep ecology & `conserve or die' natural radicals.  His scientific analysis of climate continues to expand in awareness of cycles now.  He predicts more extinction events if we don't stop polluting ourselves to death, by producing greenhouse gases heating up our weather. Whole earth energy dynamics are ignored in popular science or mass media,  So we won't really understand the Revenge of Gaia, unless.....?
        He describes many patterns of causes & effects, while rejecting most specialized sciences inability to learn whole cycles. Like the melting of ice-caps, glaciers & vast deep invisible methane greenhouse-gases releasing from sea bottom & arctic tundra permafrost, swamps, bogs, wetlands, & dying rainforests. 
       The scary title of Revenge' of Mother earth puts off the `soft energy tech' saviors with `sustainable development' who need solutions to keep consuming in luxury. He rejects much popular earth-science, replacing it with natural trends we can learn by dropping blind-faith in industrial-experts.  He criticizes many authorities presumed superiority with their super-tech & theories of progress.  Lovelock uses & redefines some Darwin `Evolution' while predicting more bad claimate news.  Like the rising seas, flooding, forest fires, drouts, famine & freezing zones. 
          He reframes much ecology fields in `State of the Earth, What is Gaia & History of Gaia" chapters. But he ignores much evidence of cataclysmic evolution of sudden climate shocks, while hinting at extinction causes.  To U$ he's `Paul Revere' or "sky is falling" threats warning of coming climate disasters, past the `point of no return'.  His solution is Nuclear power of `clean energy' a raging controversy, I disagree with, favoring back to the land Permaculture - organic homesteading like 1/2 earthlings are still doing invisible from most civilization, except in National Geographic, Discovery & Learning TV channels.
        To me "Revenge' is his best book, because its the peak of 35+ years of his research on earth changes, now a crisis.  We're heading into the deadly combination of our polluting effects & natural earth changes from increasing sun energy in 3 decades since `Gaia theory' emerged in '79.  He confesses learning more & still don't know it all.  He's growing consciousness of Gaia (& his death? It may take years to decades for us to learn the patterns & cycles he's explaining, unless you dive into conserving & learning how Gaia is living self regulating organism that millions intuit with respect for & depending natural rhythms, cycles patterns of weather & fertility
