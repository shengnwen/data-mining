I first read a friend's copy of this book, which he had used as a text in a psychopharmacology course.  i soon acquired my own copy, and a number of my friends have read it--it's a very accessible introduction to  mind-affecting drugs, with generally good pointers into more specific  literature.     Julien's strengths are in the area of legitimate,  prescription use; i feel that the recreational sections are somewhat less  complete.  the chapter on psychedelics is, unfortunately,  nigh-on-useless--errors and omissions here mar an otherwise excellent book.    this book has been an indespensible reference for me
