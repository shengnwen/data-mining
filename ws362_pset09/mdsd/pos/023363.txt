Wormwood by G.P Taylor was a pretty good book although not the best book that I have read. It has suspense but because of the factor that it seems so unreal, it doesnt captivate you as much as a believeable story. Although there are some flaws I would sitll recommend you to read thsi book if you wanted to read a thriller, mystery or suspense book. 
As you can tell by the name if you are really familiar to the bible, wormwood is a kind of plague that brings down evil to the earth and causes people to die. taylor uses ghost, magic and all sorts of usual things in this book that lead to the bringing of the comet to the almost hitting of the earth and causing destruction. These problems are caused by a single book. A book that brings temtation and feelings of hate to all people. As events unfold. People realize what is going on when they see angels taht have come from the heavens. Like most books, the heros win and evil is killed temporarly.
