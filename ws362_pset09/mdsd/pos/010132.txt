I can think of few films that have touched me as deeply as Lynch's "The Elephant Man."  Hence, I was prepared for an anticlimactic theater piece when I picked up the script and subsequently attended the play.  To my surprise, it's every bit as powerful as the film--in no way a replacement for Lynch's supreme achievement but a necessary complement to it.

Pomerance' play concentrates on Dr. Frederick Treves, whose experience places him in the company of Conrad's Marlowe.  By the end of the play his promotion to knighthood is one more empty Victorian consolation added to a career that has become meaningless.  In his powerful, climactic "corset" speech he rises to social indictment of the highest order--a recognition of the "horror" and a denunciation of the shallow, exploitive, self-deluded, spiritless society that he would prefer to be no part of (his epiphany is also suggestive of Charles Smithson's in "The French Lieutenant's Woman").

Juxtaposed with the film, Pomerance's play makes us aware of the power of the theater of the imagination.  Unlike the movie, whose requirements for verisimilitude led John Hurt to putting on facial make-up for six hours prior to each day's shoot, the play's John Merrick appears without disguise.  His normal features are soon replaced, however, by the audience's realization that Merrick could be--and is--any one of us.

Both a little less realistic and less sentimental than the film, the play is at the same time a provocative and moving study in self-discovery
