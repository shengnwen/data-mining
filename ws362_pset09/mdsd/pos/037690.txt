It always amazes me to ponder how a single person can change the course of history, as Thomas Cahill shows. For example, if St. Patrick hadn't returned to Ireland to found monasteries, we would be reading a different history of continental Europe. In fact, there might not be a Europe. Really enjoyable book with interesting anecdotes. Very readable, except for occasional flights of political correctness. Makes me want to find out more about Medieval Europe
