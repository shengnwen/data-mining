This is a nice reference book for an experienced field guide user. It is small enough to carry into the field.  Be aware however that it is not a &quot;beginner's book&quot;--it is difficult to use if you don't already  have a good idea what your unknown plant is.  Also, the drawings are  coarser than what one could wish for.  On the plus side, the author adds  excellent ecological notes on almost every plant.  A useful glossary is  included, as well
