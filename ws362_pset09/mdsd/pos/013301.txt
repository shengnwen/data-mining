Captain Chakotay of Voyager and his sister, shaman-trained Sekaya, begin this duology's second installment where we left them at the first book's end. Imprisoned on the apparently abandoned colony world Loran II's surface, in the hands of the supposedly dead Cardassian scientist Crell Moset. Delivered there by a shapeshifting "Founder" who has spent years trapped in the form of a respected Starfleet officer, who now assumes Chakotay's identity and orders Voyager's immediate departure for Earth. Which will leave the real captain and his sister to die in Moset's laboratory, whether from the Butcher of Bajor's horrific research or afterward - because Moset can't afford to let witnesses live.

Meanwhile, Admiral Kathryn Janeway's mission to persuade several seceding worlds to remain in the United Federation of Planets is not going well. On the Klingon sacred moon Boreth, B'Elanna Torres continues researching her baby daughter's heritage as the fulfillment of ancient prophecy, after her husband Tom Paris joins Janeway's mission; and on Earth, concert musician and Starfleet spy Libby Webber makes a discovery that's connected to both the admiral's diplomatic assignment and the events unfolding aboard Voyager.

This is Golden at her Trek-author best. The story's threads come together in ways that surprise the reader without blindsiding, and the characters we Voyager fans already know so well behave exactly as they should. The new characters Golden introduced in her first Voyager re-launch duology manage to play major parts without making me resent the pages they occupy, although I'm still not sure what she has in mind for Akolo Tare. That's one of several plot threads that aren't tied up neatly. This is fine with me, since I know more books are coming. Although Enemy of My Enemy has a satisfying conclusion, it ends with a twist that has me asking with pleasant anticipation, "But what's going to happen next?"
