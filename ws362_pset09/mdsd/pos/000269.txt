The thing I have liked most about the Ender-related books is how well Card has explained how different cultures, and different people, think differently. There is not a lot of action in these books, but they are still fast-moving because you wonder how one character will react to something another character does. I felt the series was running out of steam with this book, so it was slower than its predecessors, but it's still a worthwhile read for anyone who read the previous books
