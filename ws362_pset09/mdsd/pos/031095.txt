This one was a joy to read.  Like one reviewer said "another book about books."  (My, I do love those).  This is a absolute delight to read though.  It is funny, flows well and most of all, is highly entertaining.  So many works written near or at the turn of the last century are burried, seldom read and difficult to find.  It is a pitty.  There are so many wonderful, little known works out there, that simply are not in the public eye as they deserve to be. This is one of them.  Highly recommend this one
