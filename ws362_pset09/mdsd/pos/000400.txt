THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA is one of Shaw's most biting critical commentaries...this time on doctors.  Shaw hated doctors, as a result of a botched operation on his foot, so here he portrays them as a group of  ignorant, bull-headed windbags.  All, that is, except for one doctor, who  has actually found a cure for tuberculosis.  The &quot;dilemma&quot; in the  title is whether to use the cure on a talented young painter who is a moral  and ethical sleazebag, or on an upstanding middle-aged physician who is a  good soul, albeit a boring and relatively mundane one.  All this is  complicated by the fact that the doctor is in love with the painter's wife!    The biggest problem with the play is that it has lost some of its impetus  in the last century.  Antibiotics can now cure tuberculosis, and the  medical profession is far more restricted in its use of  &quot;experimental&quot; treatments than it was then.  However, Shaw's wit  and invective is still poignant even at the end of the twentieth century.   A must-read for Bernard Shaw enthusiasts...
