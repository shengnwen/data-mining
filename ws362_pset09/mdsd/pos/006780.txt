One of Peters's best plots. Despite Cadfael's absence in the middle of the narrative, this chronicle kept my attention.  This is a deeply religious experience as Peters examines some of the origins of Christian dogma through her characters. As always it is Peters's style that sets it above the common mystery. Trurly one of the best of the Cadfael series
