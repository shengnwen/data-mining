I purchased this for my 3yr old son for his b-day. His grandparents gave him a collection of 15 "classic" books, and yet, Alphabet Adventure is his favorite. The graphics are bright and busy that are attractive. The story is a good way to learn one's ABC's. I think my son's favorite part about it is trying to locate Little i's missing dot on each page. The story also incorporates the capitol letters, which my son could already recognize. Although most ABC activities available to preschoolers only teach the uppercase letters, Alphabet Adventure is a great next-step in learning that uppercase and lowercase letters can look very different, but still be the same. I would recommend this book and will probably give it as a gift for the kids I know coming up on 3rd or 4th birthdays
