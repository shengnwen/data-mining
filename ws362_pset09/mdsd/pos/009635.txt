If you enjoy the plot twists and legal thrills that Grisham's books generally bring, this short novel might let you down.  There is little adventure and no surprises in Bleachers, a look into a small sleepy Texas town that finds its identity in its football program.  Though not Grishamesque, the book is well written and enjoyable to read.  The small Texas town and the characters that live there are undeniably real and the image Grisham puts into the minds of the readers through is pen is very vivid.  The football fan will enjoy the many pages of play-by-play of a football game communicated through a radio announcer.  Not only a novel about football and small town politics, the author explores other themes such as the power of expectations, death, the importance of discipline in life, and the value of relationships.
