I read this book when I was about 18 years old and I adored it. Her style is lovely. She really captures many things that I can imagine jolly old England looking, smelling and being like. But after reading a few biographies of Chaucer, most historians believe that Phillipa, the sister of Katherine was possibly also Johnn of Gant's lover and had at least one child by him prior to hooking up with Katherine. It has been written that Chaucer married Phillipa at the bequest of John of Gant and mentored the family during his life.
Many of the characters are historically well-captured, Miss Seton wove an interesting tale around the information she was able to learn at that time. The problem is that there isn't much information about Katherine herself, and the uppercrust Brits still seem to regard her with a bit of dismissal and distain. Sad, too, since the children of these two people provided the later Tudor dynasties with all sorts of interesting relatives.
Nevertheless, the book is very enjoyable
