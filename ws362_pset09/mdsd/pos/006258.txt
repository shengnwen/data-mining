This unstoppably heartrending biography of Canadian pianist Glenn Gould unveils the mysteries of a perfect art more cogently and beautifully than has any other artist's biography I've ever come across.  Kevin Bazzana has opened up Gould's eccentricities and placed them where finally they must sleep - merely deep in the natural whole of one of the inescapable musicians of the 20th century.  Those lucky enough to know the meaning of the art of Glenn Gould will always be grateful for that achievement.

This is a tremendous book.  The moments when Bazzana's utterly secure love for Gould's art shines through are the most extraordinary aspect of a completely worthy biography.  With deep and glistening writing Bazzana evokes every aspect of looking-at-Gould with the same sound character found in Gould's playing - it's an amazing experience!  This is biographical literature extensive and schooled, and even wise; reading is like gliding on glass, so perfect is the author's determination, and Gould lives on every page. What could be better?

Was ever a pianist's art more wonderful?  Gould's playing is always extraordinary by every standard, and beyond. And not only the playing, of course; his mind, his understanding of music, his humor - these form the scaffolding of a remarkable artistic vision.  For all his reclusion, his is the most giving human art, reaching to infinity.  Art of the gods obtains dimensions the proof of which can be heard in everything he played.  It's a consuming art, yet so freeing.  The wondrous thing about it is how Gould kept so much of himself even as he spent lavishly on Bach and Byrd and Schoenberg.  Music never overtook Gould - that task inevitably fell to Gould himself.  

By literature of this kind, the sadness that still lingers around Gould's death seems entirely transformed.  This is a great book that ends too quickly and lingers too pervasively.  Afford yourself the wealth.
