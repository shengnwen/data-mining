Elly St. Clair and Cooper Boone are engaged-until Elly finds out that Cooper has fought a duel over her. It's not the dueling she minds so much, as the reason for it-control of the Aurora Springs Guild. Elly had hoped Cooper was at last showing a bit of passion toward her. Instead he was only concerned with his rival's attempt to worm his way into Guild leadership by marrying Elly, whose father sits on the Guild council.

And Elly naturally suspects Cooper of the same motive-especially since he has always wanted to head the Guild. So she breaks off their engagement and moves to the big city-Cadence City-where she starts her own business. But Cooper has no intention of letting her go.

Taking us into the world of Harmony, a planet settled by earth's descendants, who have begun to develop psi powers after a few centuries there, Jayne Castle, AKA Jayne Ann Krentz, AKA Amanda Quick pens yet another winner for the reader to enjoy.

Mix action, suspense, drama, hot romance and plop it down into the middle of Castle's lush and intriguing world, and you have the author's usual can't-put-it-down-`til-the-last-page success. Castle's imagination has carried us through many incredible and riveting yarns, and it doesn't fail us here as she skillfully draws us into Elly and Cooper's hunt for a psi killer who is peddling an extremely dangerous new drug.

I enjoyed this book as I always enjoy Castle's work: way too much. But when Castle/Krentz/Quick has a new book available, the rest of the world will just have to wait. Recommended.
