These books are amazing! As a minority student, I came into the Examkrackers course having already studied for months with other books and hoping for a 24 or 25 on the MCAT. After studying with these books for 10 weeks, I gained new confidence and I took the August MCAT expecting a thirty or better! My practice exam scores steadily increased over the 10 week study period from a 22 to a 30 on the last two exams. What helped me most was the way the books presented the material to me. There were no longwinded explanations or useless facts that would confuse me. They cut right to the chase and told me exactly what I needed to know and what I needed to do in order to improve my score. The verbal strategy was especially effective when I totally committed myself to it. I went from a 9 to a twelve in verbal. (One criticism is that the verbal books need more practice passages.) I highly recommend these books to anyone having trouble finding quality study materials for this exam
