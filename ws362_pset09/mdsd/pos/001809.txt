Ever since I read &quot;Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day&quot;, I always wanted to pick up another book by Judith Viorst. This book is it and does not disappoint. A little boy, Nick, is convinced that there are monsters, vampires and other night creatures out to get him. His mother tells him there aren't any. But Nick is not so sure, especially since his mother is wrong about so many other things, such as there being no more cream cheese left when it is really hiding under the lettuce; him being able to carry the heavy bag with the eggs in it when he can't; and telling him his crayons are on the top shelf when in fact they are not. Just as Alexander said: &quot;It was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day&quot;, little Nick says: &quot;So...sometimes even mamas make mistakes.&quot; However there are some things mamas are right about. The black and white illustrations by Kay Chorano are great and I especially like the way she draws the various monsters---very unusual, fantastic and scary. Children who are certain there is something lurking under their bed will enjoy this book and its comforting ending
