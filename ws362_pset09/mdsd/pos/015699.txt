This is a wonderful guide but be aware that it is written in French.  There are lots of symbols to rate the restaurants and hotels but the written descriptions and comments are all in French.  With some basic French and a good French-English dictionary, you will be able to decipher the reviews.  Fortunately, about one third of English is based on French so many of the words are easily decipherable.
