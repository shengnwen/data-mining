The wisdom of Rabbi Harold Kushner transcends Judiasm.  It finds applicability to people in all wallks of faith.  In "How Good Do We Have to Be?"  he puts feelings of guilt and inadequacy into perspective.  Even if the reader does not agree with all that Kushner writes, the big picture is highly agreeable.

The best statement of the book is on page 180-181, "Life is not a trap set for us by God, so that He can condemn us for failing.  Life is not a spelling bee, where no matter how many words you have gotten right, if you make one mistake you are disqualified.  Life is more like a baseball game, where even the best team loses one-third of its games and even the worst team has its days of brilliance.  Our goal is not to go all year without ever losing a game.  Our goal is to win more games than we lose, and if we can do that consistently enough, then when the end comes, we will have won it all."  God does not expect us to be perfect as this is not part of human nature.  While the guilt and shame that haunt us as part of sin are normal consequences of our sins, it is functional to know we are in error.  

Kushner also explores the Garden of Eden and the concept of original sin.  He suggests that original sin allows us to feel the same discomfort God feels when he sin.  This was the wisdom we earned from the tree of knowledge.  We are forced to feel the same stress when our children fail as when God sees us fail.  Yet we still love our children.  This takes us to the main point of the book.  God will love us despite our failings.
