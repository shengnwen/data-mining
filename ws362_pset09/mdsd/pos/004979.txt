While I can't go into too many reason's why here, I can honestly say that John Grisham's "The Broker" does a very nice job of depicting the rather boring side of being a "spy," no matter what country or cause you work for.  While it's very tense at times, of course, Grisham's portrayal of the day-to-day instruction and endurance it takes to turn a normal, if overly pushy and obnoxious, American into an overly-secretive, spy-like being who dreads being found out is right on target. 

In short, successful spying is usually less action/adventure/James Bond than it is rote learning and human insight. "The Broker" captures that, in spades, and mingles it nicely with the political claptrap that IS America's capital city. 

Does this make for a great book?  Well, not great, no...but it is very good.  It makes for a tense, at times wrenching, read if you have a brain at all, along with some light romance, self-reflection, and a dry (non-Bondian) sense of humor. It's also, unfortunately, better at the logical, plot-driven tension and espionage than most recent offerings by Koontz, Higgins, Parker, Hiaasen, or Patterson. (More a reflection of them than it is of Grisham.)

All in all, "The Broker" is definitely worth your eight bucks.  Go for it
