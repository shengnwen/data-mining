This book has ideas for religious ceremonies, non religious, traditional or contemporary and even ideas for a second marriage, renewal of vows or marriages of people with Children.  The book is very easy to read and it  has vows that you can read word for word or ideas and guidelines to build  your own vows upon.  This gives a lot of ideas for alternative and original  vows.  Also, just because it mentions &quot;THE ALTAR&quot; in the title,  doesn't mean the readings wouldn't be appropriate for a contemporary non  religious ceremony.  I would definatly recommend this to anyone who doesn't  want the traditional &quot;Love, honor and OBEY&quot; vows
