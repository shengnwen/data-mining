I was diagnosed with RA in December and picked this book up soon after.  It gives lots of information about the course of the disease, medications, exercises and diet.  I've loaned it to family members and reference it whenever I have a question about what my body is doing.  The only drawback is that medications are developing at such a fast rate, that the book is already a bit outdated after only 3 years.  However, it is still a great starting point
