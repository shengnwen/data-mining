St Gregory was a very subtle thinker, one unfortunately fairly poorly studied until fairly recently by scholars.  

Hans urs Von Balthasar's studies, as with several of his works which explore Patristic thought, illumines for the first time many aspects of this great Eastern Father's philosophical and theological thought.  

Gregory of Nyssa is revealed by Balthasar as both an outstanding theologian and philosopher, who applies Greek metaphysical ideas of Being and Infinity to the God of Christian belief.  For Gregory what is central is God's infinitely transcendant Being, which by virtue of its metaphysical infinity is entirely incomprehensible in every way to the human mind.  Nevertheless, the human mind is drawn to participate in the mystery of infinite Being, both by its beauty and by its infinite fullness and richness, but is always defied as the finite can never rest in the infinite.  Somewhat contrary to Thomas Aquinas or Augustine, Gregory has a very dynamic view of God and the soul's relation to it, having the view the soul is always ever drawn further into the mystery of Being, or else ever further descending into nothingness if it falls away from Being.  

Gregory also offers a deeply subtle philosophical and theological idea of time and temporality and change, and weaves a rich metaphysical tapestry into which the life and existence of each being is a mysterious paradox standing on the bridge between the fullness of God's unfathomable being and the emptiness of non-being.  Man is by nature a temporal creature, also ever gravitating towards death and nothingness, but at the same time called to immortality by participating in God's being.  

This monograph brings out many of the more subtle and interesting ideas in Gregory of Nyssa's thought, which has a depth which matches that of a Descartes, Hegel, Kant or Husserl in our own modern era.  For any philosopher of religion or theologian, this book is well worth reading carefully.
