Well written, intelligent. A good look into what it is that those brain surgeons actually do. I for one never knew that neurosurgeons and neurologists are a different breed altogether. And yes, the one neurologist I know does have a goatee and wears a bow tie..

I gave it 4 stars since I sort of lost interest in a couple of the last chapters since it seems like she was just trying to fill up space and had really nothing more to say.
