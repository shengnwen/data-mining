This is an excellent book, and anyone in education should read it.  From 1988 to 1990 Kozol author of Savage Inequalities Children in America's Schools traveled to and visited many different areas and schools.  He did this because of his interest in racial segregation, which still went on in places.  He wrote about segregated vs. wealthy school districts, including interviews he had with students and administrators.  
He states, "Early in my journey, to attempt to listen very carefully to children and, whenever possible, to let their voices and their judgments and their longings find a place within this book.    The following are some examples of what is in the book.  "The toilet stalls, which are eaten away by red and brown corrosion, have no doors.  The toilets have no seats..."  This is the look from one of the better schools.  Classrooms have old equipment and sometimes no equipment at all.  An Introductory Home Ec class helps to train students in fast food places like McDonald's and Burger King.
The children Kozol talked to are smart.  They have dreams, that can't be achieved, due to circumstances that were never in their control.  Most of these students won't go to college, but instead join the military and fight for things they can't have and enjoy.  Many poor districts received less money, do to taxes and state funding. Administrators agreed money would make a difference.  New equipment and repairs can be made and the children will be in a better environment and can have a better education. Others believe that money won't make a difference.
