With mainline churches in America (and elsewhere) unraveling, and conservative religion (of all faiths) on the increase, it is no wonder there would be a corner for a nifty little book like this.  Make no mistake, it is a powerhouse of sorts..lots of current information that is not found elsewhere, well-documented, rare facts gleaned (presumably) from Grant's visits to the Middle East, written in a fast, tight style.  That is, until 2/3 of the way through the book when he shifts to evangelical theology of end time events, and this continues through the remainder of the book.  Evangelical theology in America has many favorite doctrines, several of them in this book (the 144,000 being witnesses in Revelation for example).  He preaches a literal end time Temple in Jerusalem (some theologians see the use of "temple" in the New Testament restricted to the church as God's temple, but Grant has Scripture support for his thesis as well).  The advantage of this book is it's little known and well-documented facts, current information, and well-written first 2/3 of the book detailing what he sees is coming as a result of the Mid East unrest.  It is hard to put down, and due to it's size (176 pps plus supplements) can be read in two days carefully, and should be considered an update of The American Prophecies by Mike Evans.  Well worth reading
