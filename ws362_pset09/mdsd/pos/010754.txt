Whatever else you may think about Martin Amis, he sees the world and reports it better than any one writing today. The man is incapable of thinking in cliches. His view of the US from a brit-writer-on-tour's pov is priceless. And he does it without once bashing the obese who have become the prime target of every other euro-brit-ozian who writes about yanks.

If you're looking for a lovely, linear narrative (as some below seem to be) look elsewhere. If you're to sort who liked "Withnail and I" try this. It's the next act.

My reading of this one was long overdue. Glad I finally got around to it. A true gem. My only problem with it was that every few minutes I had to fight back the urge to read out loud to whoever else was around.
