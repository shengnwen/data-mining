Out of all the events (and non-events) in this book, the moment that most stood out in my mind is the private palaver between Roland and Jake.  The main purpose of Wolves of the Calla in the Dark Tower series is, I think, to tell the tale of Jake's initiation into the Gunslinger order.  Up until this point, Jake has been a `prentice, though prepared in the physical requirement, not yet ready to bear responsibilities for strategic decisions.  But here in Calla Bryn Sturgis, he finally makes his challenge to his teacher.  Jake's questioning of Roland's decision not to tell Susannah of Mia's presence marks what is certainly a less violent coming of age than Roland's own challenge to Cort with his hawk, but a challenge nonetheless.  When Roland admits to Jake, "I don't know what to do.  Would you like to tell me?" he concedes that Jake has earned a say in the decisions of the ka-tet.  Jake is so taken aback with this concession that he thinks Roland is being sarcastic, but after discussion, the two come to a compromise concerning Mia.  Jake at first has trouble accepting that the ka-tet will follow his decision for good or ill, and accuses Roland of passing the buck, but Roland (Ah, gods love him - could King have written this part at eighteen?  I think not.) bids him put aside childish indecision once and for all to claim his rightful place.  Out of all the moments in all 900 pages, this is the moment that got me most.  

Other highlights:
The weapons and appearance of the enemy have surprising origins.
Roland gets laid by a worthy woman.
Susannah learns a new weapon and rocks it.  (Yeah, girl!)
Eddie meets up with his old drug-dealing pals and owns them once again.
Jake becomes the man.

Lowlights, however:
Vampires?  Really?
Susannah's demon spawn?
An entire town full of new characters?
Andy = Jar-Jar?

Wolves was a great book, albeit too long, and probably largely unnecessary.  Not a waste of time, though.  I was thoroughly entertained, as always
