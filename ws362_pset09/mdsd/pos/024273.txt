Rawl's work here takes his previous articulation of justice and places it inside the context of 'reasonable' society characterized by pluralism (i.e., various peoples who adhere to incompatible comprehensive doctrines).  Their coexistence is made possible by the existence of the political 'overlapping consensus'.  This entire work awed me page to page. The arguments within this book have the rare beauty of answering many of your questions as they enter your head.  Such a work cannot be skimmed, but it must be perused.  Even if, like myself, you are not a specialist in politics, this will be an engaging and fruitful reward if the time is taken to read it and ponder it.  Rawls has created a truly wonderful contribution to civil society
