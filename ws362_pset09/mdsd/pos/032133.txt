Building Codes are never a fun subject to have to research, but Ching makes it a little less mindnumbing by providing illustrations.  However, be warned that this book is based on the 2000 International Building Code and that many of the sections have been revised in the 2006 IBC.  I imagine that Ching will soon update his book to reflect these changes
