I bought this book on a recommendation from my professor.  The task that I had to do was to design a questionnaire for a research project I am working on.  To be honest, I didn't know where to begin, which is why I picked this up.

This book is quite thorough in its approach to questionnaire design.  In fact, it is so thorough that I didn't have time to follow all of the steps.  To be honest, this book is written from an institutional point of view.  If you're like me, a student who needs to complete a questionnaire by next week, then you'll be able to benefit from the sections on item writing and data analysis.  However, you won't be able to get as much peer review and pilot testing data as this book recommends.  I would probably recommend this if you have a lot of time to prepare your questionnaires or if you are working for an institution such as a university or a company with the resources to carry out the pilot testing recommended here
