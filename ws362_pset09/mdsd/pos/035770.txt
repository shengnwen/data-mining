This is an excellent book which presents a very well researched and very well written theory that Freemasonry originated in the suppression of the Knights Templar in 1308 rather than from the medieval stonemasons' guilds, as most official Masonic histories suggest.

The conclusions Robinson draws from the available evidence are logical and rational, unlike some of the more far fetched theories on Freemasonry which have been published recently.

In short, an excellent book that is well worth reading.
