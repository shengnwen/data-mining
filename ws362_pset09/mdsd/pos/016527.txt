While an interesting story, what really separates this book from the pack is its probing look at how much we can learn drawing only from the universe, versus sitting in class and having someone tell us what they have been told is known.  Ramanujin operating in a social vacuum experienced tremendous sucesses and tremendous failures.  He reinvented theorems that were known 100 years earlier, because he did not attend universities that would have saved him such work.  On the other side of the equation, he tackled problems sometimes, from a completely unique perspective, having not had his way of thinking "institutionalized" by those same universities.  This is the lesson that hits home in this book.  Both types of learning are important.  Both create stumbling blocks to higher levels of discovery.  It seems to me that this is probably true of every discipline to which we have given a name
