As a life-long-bird lover with limited time to be an active one, this book gave me a great birding adventure.   When I closed my eyes after reading,I was there-looking and listening.  What can be more enjoyable-especially when you cannot leave the office until the weekend? Whether the logging of swamp land is right or wrong, this book can make all aware of the delicate balance anywhere we live and that we need to consider each move we make and its effect on nature. I thank the author for sharing such an enjoyable adventure
