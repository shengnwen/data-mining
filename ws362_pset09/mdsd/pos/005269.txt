I like the beautiful pictures of the flowers, the recipe-like instructions on how to make the arrangements, and the writings from Rebecca Cole that encourages the reader to be creative, and skip the recipe if you'd like.  I borrowed this book from the library to check it out, and I think I'm going to buy it to keep because it's such a beautiful, practical and inspirational flower book
