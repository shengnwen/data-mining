I first read this book the year that it won the Hugo Award for Best Novel of the Year, and my reaction was one of wonder and astonishment. 

Here we had the Hindu pantheon of gods introduced into science fiction, and the rather disorientating experience of starting the story in the middle of events. On first reading it takes a while to understand the background: a group from India arriving on the exotic planet Urath, and adopting godlike powers. We meet Sam, whose essence has been stored in magnetic clouds surrounding the planet before being awoken by Yama's prayer machine. He is the reincarnation of Mahasamatman, who is also known as Siddhartha, Buddha, Tathagata and Lord of Light. He finds that the mass of the population has been tyrannized and kept in ignorance.

Roger Zelazny died far too early, and as with his well-known Amber series, he shows here a remarkable insight into different cultures and beliefs. In Lord of Light he demonstrates a rare appreciation of the stages of human development described in Hindu beliefs, and uses this as an essential backdrop to an exploration of the abuse of power, love, vanity and knowledge. Zelazny explores religion not just as a means on enlightenment, but also of oppression. Themes that have never been more topical
