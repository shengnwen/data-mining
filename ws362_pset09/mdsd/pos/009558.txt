Great book.  I have read both of David's books.  The are both great books that will make you think twice about some of the things you may do on your motorcylce.  I felt like "More Proficient Motorcycling" repeated many of the things said in his first book "Proficient Motorcycling", although it did go into more detail on some of the topics.
