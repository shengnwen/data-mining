Uhura falls in love in this novel. She falls in love with an arrogant, brilliant, musician. The Enterprise is on it's way to a planet that is going to be swallowed up in a nebula, unless they can find out why it is growing. The strang creatures on the planet sing all day and all night. Hunters hunt them for the tears they shed when they are killed. The Klingons have an intention of claiming the planet. In the end they all work together and solve the problems. This a good book, but I think Uhura is a little too loose
