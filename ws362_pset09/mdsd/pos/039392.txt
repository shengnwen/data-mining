Thanks to this book, I have embarked on a new career in environmental education.  I always dreamed about it but never realized that I could do it until I was introduced to this book.  It is a must have for anyone who works with kids: teachers, parents, youth leaders, babysitters, etc.  This book was so instrumental to me, that I gave a copy of it to two of my professors who were most influential in making my first year back in college to persue this new career a success.  I know it has had an impact on one of these professors!  Even after being introduced to some of the major environmental education programs (i.e.: Project Wild, etc) I still return to this simple book again and again
