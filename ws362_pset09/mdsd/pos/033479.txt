To understand Islam one has to understand the Koran. This is what Don Richardson has done in his book "Secrets of the Koran".

Sadly many strike out in fear and ignorance against what they do not understand. This is not a charge that would stick against Don Richardson, who studied seven versions of the Koran in the writing of this book!

A key challenge for any author is to present information in order that it can be readily absorbed, understood, and applied.

I have given this book a five star rating because it is written on the basis of truth, and its comprehensive presentation of these truths to the reader.
