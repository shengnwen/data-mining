The Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age novel that tells the story of a boy who learns about himself during a remarkable journey with struggles of identity and the exposure of the unseen world around him. Holden Caulfield is lonely and does not belong to any particular clique. He deals with a vanishing childhood that leaves him unhappy and depressed. Through his critical and often times cynical sarcasm he comes across many experiences that teach and mold him into a more mature individual. He is forced to leave behind his childhood and juvenile ways. After being kicked out of Pencey Prep Holden is sucked into the adult lifestyle. Because he is tall and portrays an older imagine Holden is able to blend into his new surroundings. Though he might seem like a delinquent, he still has loving and caring feeling towards his sister and dead brother. Irony plays a great role in this book because Holden accuses many of the people he encounters as "phonies", but he himself is a phony at heart. As the story unfolds, Caulfield is faced with many hindrances he must overcome. His interest for the opposite sex grows as he matures, though he is unable to be with the girl he desires. Holden must learn that criticism is just another form of self doubt, because one can only be content with themselves if they are first satisfied with their others and their environment. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in laughing-out-loud. In my opinion, I thought this book was a great read because of it's relatability and use of humorous, yet meaningful circumstances.
