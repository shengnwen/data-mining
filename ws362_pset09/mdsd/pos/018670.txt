Satisfaction should be the standard primer for everyone interacting with a customer or partner. Period.  Easy to understand and written for abroad audience, this book is powerful ammunition in making any argument that the customer comes first.  This book opens the JD Power door to many great stories, including those about the fate of companies with great inventions but the inability to listen to the consumer.  For example, Peugeot invented one of the first fuel injectors, only to lose market share because Americans wanted to step on the gas pedal before starting their cars.   

You know you have a customer service problem if...

"You're spending more money to acquire new customers compared with competitors or compared with internal standards. Employee turnover is another indication."

If you have a problem....

"Consumers aren't expecting perfection, but they want problems to be dealt with in a forthright way." 

One example used was of Lexus. When they were first starting, there were a few "minor problems with its cars." So, "they rushed a letter of apology to every customer, then had the dealerships pick up the vehicles and bring them in for repairs."  Lexus turned a problem into a customer service advantage.  This book is filled with such relevant examples, such as using problem resolution as an opportunity to make new customers into vocal advocates for a particular company.

A must read!
