Everyone has their own idea of the perfect book, a list of approved  characteristcs they think will cohere into something magical.  Instead of  psychological realism or detailed descriptions of nature, I like brisk,  multiplying narratives, stories within stories, digressions, picaresque  journies, a profusion of character and incident, dreams, exoticism, strange  lands, bookishness, adn relentless violence.  'Candide' has this, and more,  and is therefore my perfect book. Like anything that is theoretically  perfect (an equivalent in film might by Losey's 'Mr. Klein') is that one is  left a little unsatisfied - after all, where's the element of surprise?   There are further grounds for grumbling - Voltaire can often come across as  an annoying, opportunistic jack-of-all-trades; while the sheer excess of  plot, narrated in the same urbane toneslessness, always risks becoming  monotonous. But such quibbles are ungrateful.  'Candide' is one of the few  classics that is genuinesly entertaining and uproariously, blackly comic.   The Enlightenment  values today are less convincing than the deadpan  depiction of pervasive evil and the randomness of human destiny.  The book  is full of horrific incident - earthquakes, massacares, gang-rapes,  mutilation, burnings, etc. - and yet comes across as almost breezy, and  always laugh-out-loud-funny.  I wish Bunuel had filmed this
