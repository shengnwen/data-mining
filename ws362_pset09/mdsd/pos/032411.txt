In this first book in The Chronicles of Brothers Series, author Wendy Alec has taken on one very ambitious task--to tell the tale of Lucifer's fall, starting with the relationship he had with God and his brothers before his treason, and taking us through a partial history of mankind and the workings of angels (good and evil) in its midst. Her descriptions of what she calls "The first heaven" where God and all of the angelic hosts reside are fantastical and it was a whole lot of fun to get inside an angelic perspective. 

In the beginning, the realistic, conservative Baptist part of me had a hard time getting into the book, because I kept stopping to mentally question things. For example, I'd wonder why Xacheriel, one of heaven's twenty-four ancient kings, needed a monocle. After all, a monocle would suggest impaired vision--something I wouldn't think anyone would suffer from in heaven. However, once I was able to remind myself that this was a fun, fiction book and not doctrine, I was able to enjoy the lovable bearded elder, who nods off during worship, drops his monocle in his soup and frequently declares, "Oh drat and bumble," in frustration. 

I think anyone who enjoys a good Fantasy or even Science Fiction book would like The Fall of Lucifer. And when the book leaves you hanging at the end, you'll want to read Book 2, Messiah.
