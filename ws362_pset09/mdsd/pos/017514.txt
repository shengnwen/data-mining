This book is a wonderful read. I couldn't put it down till I finished it, and I literally locked myself in my bedroom with my misic blaring so that nobody could interrupt me. The wonderful characters and captivating storyline is very addicting. I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a slightly humerous fantasy story. I thought the manunculus was soooo cute
