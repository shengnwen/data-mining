Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography creates a portal into the mind of one of America's greatest minds.  Not only did Franklin play a pivotal role in the development of our nation but he also made huge advancements in the field of electricity.  His descriptions of experiences such as the famous kite experiment grant some understanding of just how remarkable these revelations were in the mid-1700s.  His subsequent invention of the lightning rod, something taken for granted today, is fascinating to read about in his own words.

The fact that Franklin managed to accomplish all of these feats in addition to playing the role as a Founding Father is astounding and only adds to the significance of the his individual successes.
