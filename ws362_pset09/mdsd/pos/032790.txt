Normally I do not read Stephen King novels, but this one was recommended to me as being of a very different nature than the rest of his books.  This is indeed the case, as this is mostly a straight up fairy tale adventure.  It is the story of a royal sibling rivalry, a evil sorcerer, and loyal friends.  More than that, it is King's view of human nature.  King several times ephasizes that some people act completely differently when they think that they are not being seen by anyone, and this watching someone who thinks that they are not being watched plays a large role in the story.

King manages to keep the level of apprehension high through the whole book, in so doing making it a book that is hard to put down once you have started.  I think that the ability to do this is a mark of a good author, and I doubt many people would argue that King is not a good author, whether one likes his normal genre or not.

If you are not a King fan, I think that this book will surprise you.  I have not read King before, and this was not at all what I was expecting a King novel to be like.  I am told that this is because it is not at all like what King's other novels are like.  It is unfortunate that he went back to writing horror novels after he wrote this, as this is a very good book and I would have liked to read more that were similar in nature.
