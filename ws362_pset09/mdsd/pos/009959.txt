To some extent, a series of short essays on very long races is doomed, by format, to fall short of conveying the mental and physical challenges of running a long ultra.  How to express a 20 hour trail by exhaustion and pain in three pages?  That is why the Odyssey is a long book, not a 3 page essay ("uhm, I, Odysseus, met some hideous monsters and suffered for about 5 years, and then I met some more monsters and suffered some more.  Thinking about my wife helped....")

That being said, for pre-race inspiration, this is an excellent read.  Hey, before a race, I'm not sure I want to read a 200 page description of suffering.  Suffering doesn't sound too bad when it's finished in 300 words.

The writing in Running Through the Wall is uneven, but that is to be expected in this type of personal collection.  A few of the runners are a bit melodramatic (The ghost of my mother was running behind me!). The only disappointment for me was despite the back cover mentioning that the book would describe the type of training that goes into an ultra, it in fact almost never does.  I would have loved to learn more about each runners prep and their programs.  As such the book places more emphasis on the psychological than the physical, even though ultras (in my estimation) are 80% physical preparation and 20% mental (endurance, positive attitude, extreme goal-orientation).

All in all, you'll be happy with this book, especially if you read it on your way to a real ultra
