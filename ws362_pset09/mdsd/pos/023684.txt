Good rendition of a classic story..perfect if you are looking for stories that your speech delayed or autistic child can learn to "reenact" during floortime. We go to the park now and ask the other kids if they want to play "red riding hood" and they usually all say YES! So the book is really just the beginning of a fun play activity
