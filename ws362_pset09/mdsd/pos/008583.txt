Nevil Shute's main characters resemble John Steinbeck's main characters - simple, straight forward folk with the desire to do what's right not in a heroic way but in a quiet way. But unlike Steinbeck's characters who struggle in the midst of chaos and injustice, Shute's characters struggle through small problems we all might face. The terrain is not epic but quiet and thoughtful. He writes a novel here that would never be a bestseller today. There are no large, out-sized egos to fight. There are no worldwide plots of conspiracy. Instead there is a death and a little girl to honor. I recommend it for the quiet, life affirming moments we all need but too often rush by
