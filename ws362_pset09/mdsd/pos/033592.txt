I got this book recently because I needed a simple small  &quot;transition&quot; book to review all the Algebra I had lost from  taking Geometry. Well... I really like this book. It is very useful and I  hope to be able to easily integrate it with the rest of all my studying  materials. I really like how it has such an easy interface and is small.  (to fit in small backpack pockets) For these first months of Algebra II,  you guys that are too dumb to remember you basic algebra (like me), get  this book. It is a great tool for reviewing even the most important  sections in Algebra. Thanks Cliff Notes... you allow people to slack at all  times of the year.  :
