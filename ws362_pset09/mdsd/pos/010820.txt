About many of the great albums listed here. As well as the many that "Should have made it onto the list" but did not. And of course there are many, and an opinion to go with each. But more importantly, this book was produced to generate sales of the albums listed. As well as to re-establish the magazines own standing as a respected entity in the industry. It is a cozy little arrangement which benefits all parties involved, but it's all good. This Book is in my mind an incredible conversation piece, filled with interesting photos of the artist and their works. Many of which have sold millions of copies, and not necessarily due to marketing ploys, and have influenced many musicians to this day. I myself could go on for hours (just give me the time and place and a few beers) about albums that were looked over in exchange for others, many of which are both classic and or contemporary. But what is the point, when you understand how the industry works. And you realize that once upon a time just about every form of music that now exist was rejected by the so called establishment. Thats right and nearly every inovative artist to come along was snubbed and looked down upon at first. And not every highly talented and brilliant artist is going to make it through the crap to get to the top. Fortunately for us the listening public, many of them have, and this book represents at least some of the best of such artist?
