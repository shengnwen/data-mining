Wonderfull! I ADORE this novel. When i picked it up i thought it would be about some stupid whiny kid but i gave it a chance and now it's a favourite of mine! I really liked hearing of life in an 1800's Swiss village on the moutain and how Heidi faced so many hardships, emotionally and physically. So if you think you have a hard life read this book! I felt sorry for Clara when Heidi left her to head on back to the moutains. I loved how Heidi teaches her grandfather to love life a little more and it shows you how special Heidi was even though she was just a child. So read it and you won't regret it
