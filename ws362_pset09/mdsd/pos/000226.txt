This book is about a small crew of men, most of which are scientists. They rent a boat and set sail off the coast of California. They travel all over the sea on the coast of California and Mexico, in the Sea of Cortez.  The point of this voyage is not for mere joy, it is for collecting, observing, and preserving species that inhabit the sea. The focus on the interdial zone for the most part. 
	This book documents the journey and all the adventures that take place. One of my favorite quotes from the book is " the reports of Biologists are the measure, not of science, but of the men themselves". These men took the time to log everything that they did. They were meticulous in their gathering, and studying. 
	This book is not just about the species they collected. It is about the men and the things they learned along the journey. They learned to slow down and actually look at life. They were able to ponder all kinds of life, theirs and those of land and sea. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about themselves and the adventures that can occur while doing research
