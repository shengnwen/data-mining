I have read quite a few books about Oscar Wilde, both biographical and fictional. But, I must say that &quot;Judas Kiss&quot;, written by a very talented David Hare, seems to be the best among the plays.  The minute I started reading this book, I felt better about not having a chance to see  the play on Broadway, with an incredible Liam Neeson as late Oscar Wilde.  Hare's playwriting ability is so powerful, that I was able to re-create  theater stage, the story happening on it, and even Liam Neeson himself. In  terms of its narrrative, &quot;Judas Kiss&quot; takes somewhat  non-traditional look at the last few months of Oscar Wilde's life in Italy.  It is well-documented that prison changed him greatly in spirit and in  body, and that he came out physically and spiritually weaker than ever.  But, wait and see what Hare has to say about this as well as about Bosie's  presence in Wilde's life after prison, among other things
