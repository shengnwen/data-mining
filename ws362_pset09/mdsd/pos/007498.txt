This book as whole provided a great thought provoking experience. It starts out by addressing some of the real issues that plague African American people today dealing with racism and oppression. The fact that the book speaks directly to African Americans takes into account the lingering affects that past oppression has had on black psychology. I liked that the authors acknowledged that these problems are still present, but enocouraged a greater focus on self-accountability. They effectively motivate the reader to visualize themself as an achiever rather than a failure. It encourages people to focus on achieving the outcomes of their desire. The overall value of the book lies in the fact that the authors provide a great strategy for action
