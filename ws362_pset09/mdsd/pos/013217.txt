There is a reason why George Morris is such a revered member of this sport!  This book is brilliantly written in that it takes a form of a horseback riding that appears so complex and makes it easy for anyone to understand.  I rely on this book as the basis for my training in hunt seat.  His emphasis on not only on technical maneuvers, but on style as well and, through his pages, the reader truly comes to appreciate both the athleticism and beauty of this sport
