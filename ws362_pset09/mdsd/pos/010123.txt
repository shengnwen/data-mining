This has to be the longest poem I've ever finished, and yet it still wasn't long enough.  It's compulsively entertaining, touching, funny, exciting, and life-affirming.  You don't have to be an academic to appreciate it.  And even if you don't finish it, you'll appreciate what you do finish for its own sake
