Excellent summary of how/why Constitution is structured the way it is and why it has endured.  Clear analysis of where things went wrong and how to bring them in line w/ original intent.  Excellent first book on the subject  from astute Constitutional lawyer Whitehead who defends rights of religious  liberty in an increasingly hostile era unintended by the framers
