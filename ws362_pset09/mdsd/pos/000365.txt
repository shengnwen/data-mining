I was on a book shopping trip about a month ago and saw this on the New Voices section of the bookstore shelf. I decided to buy it because the title appealed to me and I had just seen a documentary about the lake dwelling people of Burma (see the cover photo). I was amazed by this book and would highly recommend this to most readers.

"Larkin" is a wonderful writing. Her style is strong. She presents the story of present day Burma by weaving the present, the past and the views of George Orwell. She uses her own journalism in the country (under stealth) as well as scholarly research to present a depiction that was often shocking and usually quite sad.

It is hard for Americans sometimes to really understand and believe that a world like 1984 could exist in modern society but this book certainly paints a picture of what other parts of the world must deal with everyday. 

This is a thought provoking work whether you approach it as literay criticism, socialology or editoral. Again, I highly recommend this book and am looking forward to going back and reading 1984 in light of what I have read here
