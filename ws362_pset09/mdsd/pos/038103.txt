My copy has highlighting on just about every page.  I found the advice to be pracitical and even inspiring in some cases.  There are 30 chapters in the book covering everything from rejection, plot, endings, mystery writing, selecting detail, getting an agent, and much more.  It's like having a group of some of the most popular authors guiding you.  

I read it cover-to-cover, which is a rarity for me unless the book is really enjoyable or useful.  The Complete Guide to Writing Fiction is both!
