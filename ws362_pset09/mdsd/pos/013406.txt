A single 30 year-old male, I saw a small notice that Dr. LeBoyer was to give a talk about "birthing" to our comunity. Not at all interested in the subject,(geez I didn't even have a girlfriend!) I only went to see this guy because he had presided over 10,000 births! If he had done that many anythings(like knitted sweaters) I would probably also would have gone!
When he entered the room, I was surprised how short he was, and how handsome. I was moved by what he had to say. A year later I read the book and tears were streaming down my cheeks. Such was its profound truth and beauty. Never before or since has reading had this effect on me.
1979 I was the mid-wife for my daughter's birth, and followed the book's advice exactly. At thirty minutes old she was immersed in the water, her clenched fingers relaxed, the vernix disappeared,the wrinkled skin filled out, her whole body relaxed, she looked straight into my eyes and smiled!
Now this same daughter is pregnant with her first child and I am buying a copy of Leboyer's book for her.
I recommend this book to everyone, everywhere
