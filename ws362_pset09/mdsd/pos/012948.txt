I found Roger Jahnke's book " The Healer Within", to be absolutely fantastic! It is not the full circle for all of your answers but it is definatly half of it!! After reading this book you will again have the stregth and self esteem to take matters into your own hands, to start trusting and loving yourself and to not have to always run for help, because it will help you to see that you are your best help, not some educated fool with a diploma pushing drugs making you even more sick than  you were to start with! ENJOY!!!!!!!
