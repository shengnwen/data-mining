This was one of my favorite Conant books. The prose is particularly well written, and bitingly sarcastic at times. I particularly appreciate S. Conant's emphasis on breed rescue, and how wonderful those dogs can be. The  characters in her book are all just exaggerated enough so you can really  get a feel for their personalities, and her descriptions of the back-biting  and gossip that goes on at dog shows had me in stitches!  If you like this  series, I think you will love this one
