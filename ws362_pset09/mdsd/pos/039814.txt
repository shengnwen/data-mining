	 I really enjoyed this book; it was exciting from the first page to the last. I loved that the most exciting part of the entire book was in the first chapter and that in reading this book you get a first hand look at what it is like being rich and also what it is like being homeless.

	Anyone who has read any other John Grisham book and has liked it would enjoy this book. Or anyone who likes books about life changing events and books about how people deal with change would also like this book.
