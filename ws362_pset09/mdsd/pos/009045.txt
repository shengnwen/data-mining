''Violet Beauragrde'', a dimwitted gum chewing girl finds the fourth ticket, (she had to give up gum-chewing for a while so she could switch to chocolate. And the title character ''Charlie Bucket'' finds the fifth and final golden ticket which was quite a miracle, considering how poor his family was and how little money they had to spend on luxuries such as candy. This motely crew of children are allowed to discover the wonders of Mr. Wonka's factory.
