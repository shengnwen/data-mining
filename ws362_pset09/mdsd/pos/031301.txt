I was first introduced to this book as a camper at a camp in North Carolina; I have since returned as a counselor there and have read it to my campers (who loved it as well)!  As a children's book it is fantastic because although each chapter presents a different story with its own plot, each also weaves together with the other chapters to produce a larger plot based on the same settings and characters.  This makes for great suspense for the kids from one reading to another!  In addition, it is a great tool for conveying the biblical lessons pertaining to a Christian's daily walk.  The stories are allegories.  The format can even be seen as allegorical in the sense that, while each believer has a personal walk with Christ and daily experiences therein, each is also a part of the whole of Christ's body, the church...with the overall picture of a Savior dying to redeem sinners and one day returning to establish His eternal Kingdom.  This book is fantastic!!  I recommend it to all --whether child or adult!-- who would seek a tremendously written children's book which will encourage, challenge, and teach one in the ways of the King!  (I, too, believe that the old edition illustrated by Jack Stockman needs to be revived!!
