Although the story is familiar - at least it should be - Lynne Cheney does an excellent job adding colors and flourishes to an already inspirational story worthy of the holiday it occurred on. To those who sit in warmth and criticize this most rich of our histories, pick up this book, throw on an old shirt, and sit outside in the cold for an hour with your bare feet in the snow and feel how it felt just for a minute to have to fight for your (and our) religious and other freedoms - not just talk about them. Great Job Lynne - thank you
