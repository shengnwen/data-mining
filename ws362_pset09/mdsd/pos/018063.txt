Veronica lost the innocence of childhood in an instant. Hiding in a shed playing hide-and-seek with her two younger sisters Ruthie and Becky, she expected to hear them call her when they were ready. What she heard was a long silence. 

Upon opening the shed door, her life was changed forever. Her two sisters were brutally murdered. The murderer, Scott Early wept at what he had done.

Painfully, Veronica and her parents, London and Cressida Swan tried to put their lives back together in their Mormon community. With no easy answers on how to go on, each in their own way survived each day after the murders. 

Scott Early was sentenced to a minimum of three years in a facility for the criminally mentally ill. Upon release the Swans would be notified of his residence for the rest of his life.

Normalcy of life was strived for by the Swans but rarely achieved for the first few years. Even when another baby was born two weeks after the murders the heaviness of losing Becky and Ruthie rested on them all. 

Veronica's best friend Clare was there to talk so that Veronica could share her deepest feelings and know she would not be judged. The Sissinellis were friends of the family and Miko was closer to Veronica than they both realized but he was Catholic and she a Mormon.

London and Cressida decided that the only way to release the burden that hung over them was to forgive Scott Early. Veronica didn't agree. Her plans for the future did include Scott Early more than her parents could ever imagine. 

Jacquelyn Mitchard is able to explore the emotions experienced by young and old in a trauma of this level and how one processes those emotions in day-to-day life. Excellent detail brought the story reality along with well developed characters.
