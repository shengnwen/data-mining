I found this book immensly moving.  It's not really because the quality of the writing is all that good.  There aren't any deep or poignant metaphors, just real life.  I think that's more important than anything.  What I liked most about this collection of voices is that I found I related to exactly what people said.  I wanted to read more about their lives just to learn more about mine. I recommend it to anyone, Asian or not
