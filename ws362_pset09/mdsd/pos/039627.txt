I did enjoy the book myself though it dragged in many parts and in some parts confusing, especially in the chapter known as &quot;Mechanics of a Dream&quot; which was a troulbing chapter. The book was a rapid apporach on socialism and the evantually downfall of captialism which i agree with, with captailsim being the downfall of everything.I would recommend this book to many people who have any views or intrest on communist or socialist history and plus its a great novel
