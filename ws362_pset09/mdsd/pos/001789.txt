When Sterling North, the narrator and author, and his dog find a den of
raccoon kits, he decides to take one home. The kit is named Rascal, and soon he becomes part of Sterling's family,   Sterling himself, his two sisters, his soldier brother, dog, and father. He becomes Sterling's constant companion, and the two are inseparable. The book, named after the raccoon, tells Rascal's tale and about his various adventures, from the neighbor's gardens to the fair pie-eating contest. He accompanies Mr. North and Sterling on a two-week trip to the wild, and Sterling to his aunt's farm. Rascal is curious and seems to have a sense of humor which fits his looks. This humor continues through out the book. However, the whole book seems to appeal to only one sort of reader, one who likes books such as the ones by Jean
Craighead George and other books about people and their wild pets. Sterling doesn't focus completely on his pet, and also talks about the people he meets in great detail. You get to know the characters very well. He shares his brother's letters, and he tells about his two older sisters who have moved away. Sterling North's style is comfortable, but moves quickly. Rascal was a good book, all in all, even if it only appeals to a small group of readers. It was a kind of slow-paced book about someone's boyhood during the war with his wild pet. Rascal is a book for anyone who likes animals
