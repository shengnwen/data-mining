First I got captured by the poetic language. Then to my suprise I noticed I was regularly laughing out loud! This novel is delightful and compelling, although you may feel it becomes just a little long-winded from the moment when the narrator retreats. 
I also want to add that I don't really understand why so many readers think it is impossible to find out the sex of the narrator. I thought the affair with Inge and the hilarious semtex attacks on the men's urinals were evidence enough for her being a woman... But I must admit the author definitely plays with preconceived ideas of gender. This, however, adds to the book's value and makes sure it remains in your mind for some time after putting it down.
For me this was a very good book that perhaps could have been brilliant. I'll definitely read more of Winterson's work
