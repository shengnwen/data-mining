Creps strikes a delicate balance between academic and street-talk. I love it! Creps deals in a fresh new way with some of the disciplines that he feels we should pick up and begin to practice. 
Parts of it were tough to read and somewhat a little boring - those were mostly in the academic (scholarly would be a better word perhaps) sections. Not all of the scholarly sections were boring, I only found the parts boring that I had to slow down in and force myself to really understand what he was trying to say.
Having said that, those parts were only at a minimum. Because he's a D.Min. Director, he's seasoned in the language of the scholar. However, because he's intentionally kept his ear to the street to hear what's happening in terms of culture and the post-modern world, he's seasoned in the language of that culture as well. 
I think it's a great book - although I won't read cover to cover again, I'll definitely go back over the sections I marked up and highlighted to refresh my memory - good stuff
