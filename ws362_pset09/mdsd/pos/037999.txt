This audio book had an excelent reader, using pretty close to the dialect of the time.  Which was good because I was using it for a character reference, playing Darwin in a theater piece.  The book it self was a little long and winded.  It was truely a journal of his voyage.  Don't look for many of his scientific conclusions.  For this you would want to get "Origin of the Spieces."  It was filled with stories of his adventures and what he came accross on his trip.  Good listening material for long driving trips.  It was a bit dry for just sitting and listening to, but there were some entertaining parts burried in there
