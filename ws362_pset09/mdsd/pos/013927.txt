This is a really great commentary on Ephesians.  I went through it with a bible study and it was extremely helpful.  It is thorough and academic (others are probably more qualified to talk about the scholarship) but also readable and devotional.  O'Brien, of course, is solidly evangelical and very well respected in the academic world.  If you are looking for a commentary on Ephesians for use in a Bible study or personal devotions, this is the one, provided your group is already fairly grounded in the scriptures and in theology and is willing to invest some time into their study.  Other commentaries in this same series (Carson on John etc) are also excellent
