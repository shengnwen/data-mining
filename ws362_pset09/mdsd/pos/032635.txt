Despite some unfortunate copyediting issues, this slim book has enough meat and asks enough important questions to make it worth reading. I like the way Morville meanders, and the book is valuable for the chapter on the socio-economic web alone. Just the same, somebody else might get as much out of a different chapter. Will keep this on my shelf and revisit in a couple years to see how things have turned out
