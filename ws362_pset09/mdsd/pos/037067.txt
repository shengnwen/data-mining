I thought this book was for a little bit younger child, but I was plesantly suprised when it arrived!  It's perfect for our 8 year old all the way to the grown-ups in the family.  Our 8 yr old likes it because it looks like a "real" dictionary/thesaurus, but is easy to use.  He's just learning how to use a real dictionary, so this was a great buy
