I first found this book at our local public library, and checked it out because of the fun, colorful illustrations. Although it was somewhat hard to read the first few times, due to the irregular rhyme scheme, it because progressively easier after listening to the CD several times. My daughter absolutely loves the book, and after only having it a week, could sing the entire story (she's three). It is a fun book that really sticks with kids, and I love that my daughter is learning, "Be happy with who you are" at such a young age. This book would be great for kids of all ages, especially those who have had a rough day or experience and are wishing for a moment they were somewhere or someone else
