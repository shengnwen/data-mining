I purchased this book last year and didn't start using it until recently.  I was initially put-off by the number of ingredients for the meals and thought that the recipes were going to be too involved for me to cook for myself after a 10-12 hr day.  Once I finally tried one recipe and saw how easy it was, I am now trying a new one every week.  There may be many ingredients, but the recipees are very simple and the instructions detailed.  I also am not left with a ton of left-overs that will ultimately end up going down the garbage disposal!  I have loved everything I have tried so far
