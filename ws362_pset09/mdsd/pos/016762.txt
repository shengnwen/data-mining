Great reference book for starting a business. Covers all aspects from accounting &amp; tax issues to marketing, and much more. I heartily recommend this book in all my seminars. Very useful three way presentation style: in depth; Q &amp; A; and stories with graphics. One of them is bound to match your learning style
