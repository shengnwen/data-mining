THis book deal comprehensively about stochastic process and queues. The book starts with refreshing probability theory. It has indepth details about renewal theory, explanation of renewal theorems &amp; regenerative processes. Examples for those processes are also well said. Then the book  turns its attention to Discrete Time Markov Chains and has carried out  indepth explanation for DTMC with suitable examples and the excercises are  really a fun to solve. Then the author turns his attention to Continuous  TIme Markov Process and explains in detail about CTMC with examples.  Queueing theory is dealt with by giving treatment to Markovian queues  first, then to M/G/1, G/M/1 and G/G/1. Also queues in tandem are well  discussed
