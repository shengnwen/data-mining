I found this book greatly pleasing to my photographic interests. It was lovely to see artistic impressions of the items at the museum. If you are photographically inclined or artistically interested in the odd, or simply looking for the 'coffee table book' none of your friends would have-then this book is for you. The images are wonderful and I enjoyed the book for that purpose alone.

If you were looking for a book that reviewed detail and information on the items at the museum then my opinion is that it was certainly lacking and that this is not the book for you. 

Having not visited the museum myself, I was hoping to have the book contain more in the area of exhibit contents or even detailed information on specific items in the collection. I believe those who are neither photographically nor artistically inclined would not enjoy the book
