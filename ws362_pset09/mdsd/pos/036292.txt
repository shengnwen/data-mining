Having been a fan of The Millionaire Next Door and The Millionaire Mind I eagerly bought his new volume. When I bought it at my favorite bookstore, I told the clerk that I was buying it for my wife which was partly true. I was also interested to know what advantages these millionaire women have over the men and how we can keep up with them.

So let me say congratulations to The Millionaire Women Next Door and now thanks to Dr. Stanley the men have the real dope on how these  millionaire women have done it, what they are doing now and what we can do to hopefully catch them or even pass them. 

Good book Dr. Stanley. Oh, I did let my wife read it and now I have a potential millionaire woman pushing me even more! Also recommend The Millionaire Next Door, The Millionaire Mind and More Wealth Without Risk
