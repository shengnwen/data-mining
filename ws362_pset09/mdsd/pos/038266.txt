...always pick David Sedaris. His writing never let's you down.  He is always engaging and hilariously funny...but he never stoops to trying to hard by being gross.  His situations and characters are outlandish...but there's always a grain of truth and realism.  Which makes the humor all the more satisfying.  It's vivid, alive, funny and even touching at times.  And they are the kind of stories that you can read every few years...seeing the characters again is like visiting old friends
