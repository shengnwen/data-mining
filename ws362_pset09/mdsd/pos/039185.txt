In this book you will find many stories, both long and short, that will challenge and inspire you in your everyday life.  Included are detailed accounts of military and war heroes, as well as normal everyday people, attempting to do the seemingly impossible for God and country.  What makes these individuals unique is the courage and determination they posess in the face of such formiddable opposition.  Dr. Samuel Gipp has spent a lifetime reading and collecting the proverbial "nuggets of gold" found in this book.  For clergy, public speakers, and those who need inspiration to fight the battles of life, this book is a must!
