I enjoyed reading the book.  It's a good beginning book for someone who knows nothing about the real estate industry.  It was well paced and did not ramble into other segments of real estate. It was unclear to me whether the models in the book were pricing labor AND materials, or just materials.  The more help the beginner gets, the happier everyone is.  Perhaps some consideration could be given to helping beginners with contractor issues?  Contractors are very reliable, but so many people fail to realize the contractor may have many clients, or that contractors function best when given COMPLETE sets of wants and desires.  Thanks for writing the book.  It definitely addresses many issues for the uninformed.
