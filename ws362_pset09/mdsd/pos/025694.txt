This was the last of a trio of paperbacks I've had bouncing around the house for awhile...  Lost Light by Michael Connelly.  Not too bad of a detective novel...

Harry Bosch is an ex-cop who can't quite leave the lifestyle.  He decides to start looking into a murder case that he was pulled off of a number of years ago, and that still remains unsolved.  It appears that the girl was murdered as part of a sex crime, but Bosch thinks it might be a diversion for the theft of $2 million from a movie set that happened in close proximity to the murder date.  But for reasons that Bosch can't quite figure out, some high-powered individuals in the FBI really don't want him looking into *anything* related to the case.  But of course, this just drives Bosch even deeper into the mystery, and he becomes obsessed in finding out who killed the girl and who stole the money...

As I said, this was a pretty good read.  It wasn't spectacular, but it served as good bedtime reading for a few nights.  The mystery as to why the case was never solved seemed to drag on a bit, but not so much that I was starting to skim.  To me, this was one of those books you'd take along on a vacation to read and unwind, knowing that you could put it down without too much problem and go do something else for awhile.  It'd still be there when you got back..
