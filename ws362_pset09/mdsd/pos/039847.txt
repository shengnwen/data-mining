This book was just the thing I needed. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who is considering a business venture of their own. It was so helpful.

It is bulleted for you to be able to do a step by step so that you dont get lost or confused when starting your business. It is informative, uplifting, it motivated me, it gave me the incentive and it gave me the courage to know I could do it. 

So far Im moving forward and by summer will be employed for ME! MYSELF! and I!

I have dreamed of being a business owner and yes it is happening. Not all the credit goes to the book because you have to have the will and the desire to go after this and you have  to really want it, but the book has taken all of that and made it possible. Im very happy with this purchase and can say that if you are thinking about being your own boss. This will be the best investment you make.
