I just got this book and i have already become obsessed with dreams of building my own Rolling Home this summer. The photographs are all very beautiful, and the book is also full of great drawings and diagrams. Not  much text, but what's there is very well written. This book has inspired me  to live my life in a whole new, fun way. This is definately worth buying
