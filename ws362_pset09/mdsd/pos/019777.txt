This book is an early example of Abbey's writings about fierce individualism. This book, along with &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; and &quot;Fool's Progress&quot; depict a desire to return to days when people were much more independent. This book, while being 30 years old, is still relevant. Where should we draw the line between governement and citizens? Abbey did an excellent job with this book
