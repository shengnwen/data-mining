Shea's work is a great place to start if you're interested in the traditional, biblical view of the Eucharist and matter in general.  While the Roman Catholic Church holds a rather defined view of the sacramental  presence (compared to the Orthodox) it is well worth noting that the west  approaches many topics with its own concepts, which is not something to be  looked down upon or rejected as &quot;a tradition of men&quot;. Shea's book  is another of those which Catholic apologists will want to have to give  away. It's cheap and accurate, as well as persuasive.  For a more detailed  study, see &quot;Eucharist&quot; by Louis Bouyer.  For general critiques of  Protestant anti-Catholic arguments, see Shea's other book, &quot;By What  Authority?&quot; or for an Orthodox approach to Protestantism, see Jordan  Bajis' &quot;Common Ground&quot;.  The main thing is to pray, receive the  Eucharist, and study for yourself.  There are no missing links in the  history of Eucharistic theology.  Take some time to review the data first  hand; pick up the Fathers and the New Testament. But don't forget that this  book is a fine place to start
