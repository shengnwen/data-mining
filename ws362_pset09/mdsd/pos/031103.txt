I admit that i bought this book primarily for the attractive illustrations fillings its pages...these inspired me a lot. Before reading this book i used to think watercolour as a boring medium -unable to achieve the strong effects I always for in my paintings. However now I have changed my mind and really am keen to try my hand in this medium -following Ms Nice illustrations one can get a very clear idea of what one can achieve using watercolour, pen and ink. However it does not really give you step by step instructions on how to achieve certain effects - i feel that one needs to be already a bit good in watercolour to try these exercises.However it is useful for those who would like to try innovative ways to achieve effective watercolour images. The pen and ink illustrations with watercolour washes are delightful. This book covers textures, transparency, wood grain, skies, trees, flowers, still life and more. Anyone who would like to add to their visual encyclopedia of fine illustraions should buy this book just for them alone! Highly recommeneded!
