I enjoyed FIREBRINGER very much.  It had all the elements of fine authorship.  The characters were stong, the plot complicated, and the setting very "real."  The book is solid and very enjoyable, but if you are looking for it to be as good as WATERSHIP DOWN it simply isn't.  Still...a wonderful "animal" book
