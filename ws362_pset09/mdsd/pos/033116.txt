I'm pregnant for the first time and I bought this book a few weeks ago. I find myself picking it up again and again. It is VERY informative and straight-forward. It includes pretty much any topic/answer that you could possibly think of. I admit that a few things in it were unnecessarily paranoid, but I really enjoy the month-by-month descriptions of changes. In fact, reading that things like cramping are normal put me at EASE rather than worried me. The diet sections list many things that I already eat pretty much every day, so I don't think it's out of line. You just have to remember that not every woman is the same and no two pregnancies are exactly alike. And that just because the book says to steer clear of sugar doesn't mean that one brownie or soda is going to kill the baby. Personally, I went off caffeine as soon as I tested positive, and put a leash on my sweet-teeth. 

This book is not a bible by any means, but I've enjoyed and will continue to enjoy referring to it. As for the sections about serious possible problems of pregnancy, I think their info. is extremely useful to know and is not just trying to scare you. It's just trying to be informative of every possible situation
