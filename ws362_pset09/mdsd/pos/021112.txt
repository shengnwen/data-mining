Early American Furniture: A Practical Guide for Collectors by John Obbard is filled with information about all aspects of furniture from this period.  Chapter one starts with an overview of the furniture trade, followed by understanding period and style, evaluation of quality, identifying period workmanship, and identifying fakes and frauds.  Each type of furniture has its own chapter (wing chair, Windsor, chest of drawers, desk, highboy, etc.).  There are many illustrations, but the only photographs are on the cover.  With all of this information covered, one can sense that this book states concepts &quot;straight to the point&quot;.  For example, on page 64, there is a paragraph which states to look for a detached shoe or two part shoe and that this is something to note with old furniture.  A beginner is not going to grasp that concept from the paragraph and illustration.  Regardless, this is a good review source for the experienced person or a good outline for a beginner.  I have spent three times the price of this book for many with less information
