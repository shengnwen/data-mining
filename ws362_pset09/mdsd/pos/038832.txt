Elleston Trevor honored me with a rare author's proof and I have a particularly soft spot for this Q caper, not least because it demonstrates his nom-de-plume Adam Hall's  absolute determination to give readers full value, starting with each story sending Q down an even more suicidal hole than the one before. 

Of all the adventures, 'Solitaire' is the one that most resoundingly drives home a lesson taught by 9/11, namely that you can wire and bureaucratise your spook setup all you like, but it counts for naught unless you have the requisite 'ferrets' working the dark side and able to deliver the right intelligence for the automatons to crunch.

This is an assignment Q wants - badly. He owes a man a death and he'll get it.  Mission: thwart a terrorist group, for which (as so often) Q needs to be drawn into the opposition's den.

The 9/11 connection takes the form of Quiller aboard a jetliner with only seconds to defuse a bomb.

My opinion is neither here nor there: everything this spymaster poet delivered was exquisite and brutal and this is one of his best.  With book trade heros like Otto Penzler doing their thing, we'll perhaps see Hall recognized for the master he is, and a new generation of readers flock to the Quilliad.

Full marks to Amazon's editors of these reviews to permit the link to the fine homage page to Trevor's work. 

Anyone who enjoys top-rate thrillers and hasn't yet discovered Quiller is in for a major treat.
