If you can get through the first chapter on &quot;selfishness,&quot; this book really does have a lot to offer.  Using charged words like &quot;become incredibly selfish&quot; and absolutes like &quot;tolerate nothing&quot; was an integral part of Leonard's in-your-face, we-don't-have-time-for-you-not-to-get-this style.  So many of us in the professional coaching industry have been touched by Leonard.  We owe him a big debt of gratitude for making the profession of &quot;coaching&quot; the big opportunity it is for us today.  This book is a good legacy to the man, as well as to what he thought was important for us to understand in our lives and in the lives of our clients
