This book proposes questions and lists readings of scripture. The reader studies the readings and responds to the questions before knowing the author's answers. Beliefs are grown from one's own understanding of scripture rather than directly from that of an author. "Understanding Bible Study for Yourself" enhances confidence in personal Bible study.
