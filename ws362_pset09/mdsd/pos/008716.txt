Get ready to be challenged to a strata of thinking rarely encountered.  Rabbi Soloveitchik inspired me to live a better life, as well as to quit smoking.  However, unless you are extremely well versed in metaphysics as well as wordly and religous philosophy get out your dictionary and keep it close by, you will need it.  The frustration of having to look up and determine "what he means by that choice of word" is worth every effort.  

It is difficult for me to express how deeply moved at times I was while finding myself lost in his thoughts.  The man was a master among us.  The book takes a determined effort to read and even though it is rather short by most standards, 137 pages, I found it to be very concise and effective, like a flash of lightening!  I believe that this is the type of book that one would profoundly benefit from reading a second time since it is so grand in scope and substance. 

It is no wonder to me that this man was so highly regarded by his peers and students.  Rarely does a person have the opportunity to encounter such a brilliant mind.  The book is a treasure house of uplifting intellectual concepts on how we can better serve God's purpose and actualize ourselves in this world, right here and now.
