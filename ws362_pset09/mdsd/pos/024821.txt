A few years ago I read a bunch of Invisibles books, but somehow always missed this one.  I might have stayed away because of the femme cover/title, and the inside art is all over the place quality-wise.  

I'm wishing that I had picked it up sooner, though, because the storylines here are among the best in the series, and maybe in comicdom.  One story I loved: yuppies at a pharmaceutical company distribute a crack that kills the bodies of users and leaves them as empty vessels for the yuppies to "joy ride."  Another: the back story of Lord Fanny and her psychosexual "spirit quest" to become a transsexual witch.

For those who haven't been exposed to The Invisibles, you need to check this series out.  I find it more twisted, more compelling, and more fringe than any of the other series I've read, including Transmetropolitan and Preacher.  In fact, this is light-years beyond anything published in drab-text "Literature."
