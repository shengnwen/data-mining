A fun book; a sort of biography mixed into encyclopedia enteries.  It's hard not to like a book based on random odd facts and, by entwining the events of his life with the entires, A.J. manages to make this as much an auto-biographical novel as a book of odd facts.  Regretably, Jacobs is pretty much a jackass.
