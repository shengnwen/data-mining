I received an Advanced Reader's Copy of this novel and not having read any of Kate Atkinson's other works I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. She is a very skillful storyteller. One Good Turn is a comtemporary crime story/murder mystery told from the point of view of 4 main characters whose lives spiral around, sometimes intersecting, but all heading to the same concluding point. It is exceptionally well done. Well worth reading.
