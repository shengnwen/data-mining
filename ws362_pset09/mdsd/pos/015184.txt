An excellent ending to the trilogy. Fast-paced without sacrificing characterisation, and a satisfying end to the conundrum of Nathaniel. A great deal has been made of the character of Bartimaeus, the wise-cracking djinn; this volume maintains the level of his characterisation, and adds some affecting glimpses of his past with the eponymous Ptolemy. However, the chilly, complex Nathaniel, and his tentative, developing relationship with Kitty Jones the revolutionary, which tracks and depends on his tentative, developing relationship with his own conscience, is what gives the climax its poignancy. It adds an important dimension to the human protagonists' actions that, as Stroud occasionally reminds us, they are still only adolescents, cast into roles and situations that would tax full-fledged and experienced adults.
