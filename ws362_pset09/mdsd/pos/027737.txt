I bought this book years ago when I first started cooking and it served me well.  I was a college student without a lot of time or money to cook, but this book had simple and tasty enough recipes that it kept me from resorting to the frozen pizza or Taco Bell for dinner routine.  This book uses a lot of convenience type foods like bottled dressings and salsas, canned or frozen veggies, and even has a few recipes that call for veggie hot dogs.  This is definitely not the book for a "foodie" or anyone looking for gourmet food that you can serve at your next dinner party, but if you are a college student short on time and cash, a vegetarian teenager that needs to fend for yourself at dinner time, someone who has no idea how to cook, or someone who just doesn't like to spend 30-60 minutes in the kitchen preparing meals this book will give you some great ideas of what you can make on the cheap, quick and easy and then it even gives you the nutritional break-down of the recipe.

Now that I have more time to spend in the kitchen and have found that I love to cook, I never use this book anymore, but it definitely had it's time and place.
