After several years of study I decided to read a text book on the current views,opinions, and changes about drug use and abuse. My choice for this book was originally based on the most current copyright date and edition.   This book with its blunt title and layout in the table of contents assured  me that this is what I was searching for. The information is spot on, and  the background, history, and unknown trivia about the use and abuse of  drugs made this book an enjoyable read.  Packed with knowledge and concise  description this book is a must read and useful addition to the book shelf  at home, school, or office for anyone seeking knowledge on the subject of  drugs and how they affect American society.  I'm glad I found it
