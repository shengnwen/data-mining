This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for a while because I passed it over for other newer books... How sorry I am I waited this long! This book is so good... the stories about the different dogs are heartwarming, and heartwrenching...they are filled with almost any dog immaginable and are a delight to read especially for dog lovers. I can't recommend this book enough..
