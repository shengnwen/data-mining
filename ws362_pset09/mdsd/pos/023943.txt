Okay, this is one of those reviews that probably won't be that helpful.

I've had a lot of fun beating up on Robert Parker for the last couple of Spenser novels that I read, and picked up this book figuring I'd do the same.

Wow.  How wrong can one guy get?

Appaloosa stampeded me under.  I picked it up and perused the first chapter and galloped over to the cash register.  I read the whole thing in a day or so.  

Did he hit the mark?  Dead bang on.  Parker is at his peak with this novel, one of the best reads I've had all year.  Everytime you figure you've got things figured out, Parker changes the rules.  It's funny and gripping and damned intriguing.  I'm recommending this book to anyone looking for a fast solid read.  Western fans will dig it, Spenser fans will dig it, and anyone looking for an honest-to-god yarn will want to pick this up and climb aboard.

Hang on tight.  This pony gallops hard for sunset, and doesn't let up for anything.

I wish I had more thumbs to tell you how much I enjoyed this read.  I recommend this book highly.

Yours in storytelling,
