  Well to be honest, I haven't read the book yet, but after having Jason and his wife speak at my school (he is a pretty hilarious guy) I just thought that if he is this good at speaking/explaining things, than his book is definitly (spell??)going to be worth my time. So don't listen to that relativist guy, he has no clue what he is talking about.
