This is a book of ninety-three poems based mostly on seemingly qabalistic principles and spiritual development. Crowley's occultism seems to be a hodge-podge of religions and philosophies, including everything from Christianity, Hindu thought to Islamic concepts and Pagan deities. Sometimes these poems even seem to disagree with each other, but are always quite inspiring. Even with all of this, this work is anything but dull. The author's wit is readily apparent throughout. I would suggest for the intellect with no prior experience in reading Crowley, to read this book. It gave me a respect for this philosopher's mind
