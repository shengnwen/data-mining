This is an 'almost done' type of book. I like the way the subject is handled. The pictures and the thoughts that go with them are really good food for thought. Still, when I read the text, I get the feeling that this book was rushed to press. One more review by the author could have helped. I get this feeling because the text does not always follow the illustrations. It neither does much to elaborate on them or to completely discuss what has been included
