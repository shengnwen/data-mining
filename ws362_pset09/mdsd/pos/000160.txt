This is a practical book, plain and simple, geared toward people who want to cut through unnecessary development clutter and get their team running efficiently.

The wisdom collected between these pages draws from years of interviews with real teams, and it shows. Crystal Clear builds on a common, essential core shared by successful teams, and helps the reader adapt these to his or her own unique situation. The author has hit a sweet spot, providing some structure without the feeling of a straightjacket.

A strength of this book is that the explanation takes place in several different styles--each presenting insights from a different perspective and filling in the overall picture so you get a broad understanding of how this can apply to your team.

Through a series of hypothetical letters, the reader first shares the experience of learning how a successful team adapts lightweight practices to their own environment. From there, you'll learn the properties a team needs to reach the safety zone and beyond. Next is a set of specific strategies and techniques that some teams use to achieve those Crystal properties, followed by a detailed look at how a well tuned process should flow through time. Dozens of work products your team might consider are described (most of these are ultra-light cousins of products generated in heavyweight shops). Chapters targeting common mistakes, a FAQ, and a Case Study round things out. The book closes on a one page distillation of the whole process, with the wonderful tag line, "All the other pages in this book only expand on this page.
