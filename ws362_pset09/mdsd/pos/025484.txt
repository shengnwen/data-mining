This cookbook is absolutely fantastic.  As are all of Ina Garten's books.  I have cooked at least half of the recipes and they never fail to get rave reviews.  The recipes use common ingredients which are easy to find and no fancy techniques are required.  It is also nicely illustrated.  Watch out though if you are "fat" conscious!  Low-fat is not her style!
