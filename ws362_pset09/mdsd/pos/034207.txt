I have read many books on diet and nutrition trying to find the answer to my weight problem. Though I have learned many things from a number of books, this one has been the most comprehensive in helping me to understand why I have been unable up to now to lose the weight I need to and to keep it off.  In the book are helpful questionaires to be filled out to determine whether or not you have problems with insulin resistance, an underactive thyroid, and/or a yeast problem.  All of these things make it difficult to lose weight and to keep it off.  Also included are suggestions on how to combat these problems as well as other issues that may be keeping those pounds from coming off.  While the diet itself is low-carb, it includes a wider variety of foods to eat than the Atkins diet making it a bit easier to stick to.  Though the benefits of using coconut oil for losing weight and overall health are discussed, this book is far more than a book about coconuts!  Well worth the money  as well as the time invested to read the book.
