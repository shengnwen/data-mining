The clarity of these quotes is quite remarkable. 

Ram Dass has the ability to very clearly and simply relate his spiritual experiences in ways that people of all religions and paths can use for their individual spiritual unfoldment. Most of this book has been inspiring and helpful to me, especially the one-liners about aging such as: 

Aging represents failure in our society, so each of us looks ahead and sees inevitable failure. 

and

We reap in age what we have sown, in our values, all along the way. 

I recommend this book and another book by Ram Dass' called Still Here, very much.
