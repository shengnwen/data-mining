I've been reading for over 30 years and I am not exaggerating that this is a terrific novel that should not be missed.  There is as much depth in one chapter as you will get in entire novels. The writing simply flows and you don't put the book down until you notice the day has gone dark and lunch and dinner time have passed you by.  Wonderful characters so rich in details they you wonder about them long after the novel ends.

Here is a description of the novel from the publishers web site -  Evelyn Hall arrives in Reno wanting only to be left alone while she waits six weeks for a painful divorce from her husband. Once there she meets Ann Child - 15 years her junior, who is both a free spirit and a lesbian.  Soon Ann refuses to let the controlled but vulnerable Evelyn ignore the powerful emotions that begin to unleash inside her... Immortalized for a whole new generation by the film Desert Hearts, Jane Rule's classic DESERT OF THE HEART is arguably her finest novel. Joyce Carol Oates called it "an intelligent and utterly believable novel". Told with all the wit and skill of this fine novelist, the book stands as a classic of lesbian literature.


I enjoyed it so much I bought the dvd!

I also went and bought the authors other novels.
