What an excellent book with many things I had never heard before!  Be prepared to rethink many of your assumptions concerning the end times.  Gives good reasons to support why I am a Christian Zionist.  God has spoken, and His Word is clear.  The book ties together Israel's prophets and the book of Revelation. If I had to recommend one book on prophecy, this would be it!  As Walid Shoebat says, "To all who seek Israel's destructiion, I say, 'Think Again.'"
