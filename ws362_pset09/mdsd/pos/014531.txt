This book was the best!!!!!  I have a book club and That was my first recommendation.   IT is one of the best books that I have seen about the Titanic.  It has a clear and easy-to-read format.  Plus, it has facts tahr are undescribable.  They are tons of interesting facts that you can read again and again.  It is a truly wonderful collection and I reccomend all to read it.  Such as did you know there were actually two Grand Staircases???  And Violet Jessop, former sewardess on the Titanic was also on Titanic's sister ships (Britannic and Olympic) when they sank?  This is a book full of fun and facts.  You will enjoy it for sur
