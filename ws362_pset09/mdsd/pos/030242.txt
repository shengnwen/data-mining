It's no denying Peter Carey is a brilliant writer. His flair for pin-pointing the nuances of the good old Aussie vernacular is spot-on, and his characters are always society's off-cuts, but ultimately likeable souls.  Theft: A Love Story was a highly enjoyable and recommended read. But unlike his brilliant True History of the Kelly Gang, it seems that Carey wasn't sure how to end this wonderful tale, and lets it fizzle out rather than leave you with the same enthusiasm you had for it in the beginning
