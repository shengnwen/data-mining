... This is a great history of social entrepreneurs, military leaders, and other great strategists who figured out how to get what they wanted.  Great short chapters on Joan of Arc, Patton, Alice Paul and the suffragists, Japan, and even Picasso and Matisse.  Turned out for me to be an excellent source of fun cocktail party chatter.  But it is a very very good and unusual kind of self-help book.  Yes, the book is NOT about military strategy, but is is about strategy in personal life.   I thought it was better than a ton of other popular history or self help books.  It helped me understand how to be more successful at figuring out how to get what I want.  On the cover General Wesley Clark calls this a "very important book" and I agree
