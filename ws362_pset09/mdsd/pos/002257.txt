I have read all of Tina's books and she is and extradinary author....&quot; Better&quot; was great, however I had to change my mindset early on to see where she was going....I keep waiting for them to find LaShawndra!  LOL I enjoyed how each of the deceased individuals mirrored the other characters and help bring them along...
