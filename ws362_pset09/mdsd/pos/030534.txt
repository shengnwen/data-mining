John Harvey has written an atmospheric mystery with a new character; Frank Elder, a retired police officer. Elder is sad, sad and has moved to the Cornish coast and is attempting to retire from life. A cheating wife, a distant relationship with his teenage daughter are what he left behind but he is also haunted by a teenage girl who disappeared over fifteen years earlier. Two young men who were responsible for the rape and murder of another teenager at the time of her disappearance are the likely suspects but the missing teenager's body is never found. The action starts when one of the culprits is released from jail. And Elder meets the teenager's mother and starts his search for the truth.

Harvey's writing is superb, as usual, but the story somehow lacks the depth and life of the Resnick series. Perhaps it is that the denouement is quite contrived and ultimately disappointing. Or perhaps it is the pervasive gloom and sadness permeating the story. 

Hopefully, this is a series that will improve. Still much better than many a mystery out there; Harvey is a talented writer.
