This Biscotti will keep your family and friends asking for more.I can't tell you enough about the Almond Crunch Biscotti, because it is that good.When you get finished eating one it is like the crunchiness and the after taste is so good that the biscotti actually has a spell on you and you just keep wanting more and more.And I am not joking when I make this biscotti everyone has said the same thing about the after taste making them want more.I love this book!!!And I try to keep some made because they go with everything from coffee to wine,so if someone stops over morning or night you have something to offer them.Plus they don't take long to make
