If business growth or commercial development is in your job description, then you will want to keep this book at hand. In the first place, it has been written for the practitioner (a point which is deeply appreciated by those of us who hate to wade through heavily footnoted academic works in order to ferret out what might be of practical use). In fact, it almost reminds me of a cookbook - a list of tested recipes you might use to prepare some business growth depending on what materials you have on hand. That is why I keep the book on my desk - it allows me to make a quick assessment of just what I am dealing with along with ways to go about it. The book does assume a certain familiarity with the activities/scenarios that surround growing a business. For a rookie, I'd recommend reading "The Entrepreneurial Mindset" first. Finally, there is a real nugget in this book, which, in my opinion, should not have been relegated to the second-to-the-last chapter. However, starting on page 181, there is a discussion on what it is really like to try to implement these market-busting moves inside a company. Having spent 17 years in industry, most of it in early stage development, I find the organizational difficulties of executing outside the normal parameters to be much harder than any technical or market challenge. This book is one of the few that even begins to address that difficulty and provides strategies to deal with it. This chapter proves that the authors know about the workings of large companies beyond the conceptual level.
In summary, this is a readable, practical, useful, and insightful book - you will not get tired of it
