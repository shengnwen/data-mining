I've been knitting for 40 years but I am someone who can't knit without a pattern, whether I design it or someone else does. That is, until now. This skill is so deceivingly simple, I can't believe I didn't already know it intuitively. It has allowed me a method to knit without a pattern and when I have limited amounts of time. I really love how loose ends are woven in as you go to diminish finishing time. 

This is a terrific addition to any knitter's skill set. I'd probably never make a sweater this way but have made quite a few afghans, pillows, hats and scarves.
