I wanted a encyclopaedia like of women artists and this comes close to it. It is not all inclusive but it has a good number of entries, including the well known ones and the not so well known. I wish it had had more international women artists. I like the fact that it had good color illustrations. I am glad it is included in my art library. It is a good bargain for the price. This is a reference book.
