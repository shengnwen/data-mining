Barbara Bordnick's photographs gives the viewer a new and extraordinary view of flowers.  Though these have always been a part of our life, the view that Ms. Bordnick gives us is incredibly beautiful.  I thought her first book was great but in her second book, Searchings II, she shows the reader even more beauty and detail.  This book is an absolute must if you are a fan of exceptional photography, Flowers, extraordinary detail or Beauty in general
