This is what anarchosyndicalists have been saying all along: the workers and the communities can effectively run the economy, and instead of capitalism, they can develop an economy based on democracy, cooperation, solidarity and enhanced creativity.

There was no centralized government either, just a decentralized federation of democratic worker and consumer councils with regional federations.
