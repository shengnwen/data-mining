I have had this book for a while but never managed to pick it up and read it until now.  I am glad that I did.  it is a facinating look at the life of a human without any human influence, a blank page, set to discover his humanity and affect ours.  Yes, the dialogue is a bit dated and you do come across some rather labored passages.  But the story itself is absolutely groundbreaking.
