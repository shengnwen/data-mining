Having just finished this book at 3;30 am few hours ago, I was glad I got my hands on it. I have read reviews here for his books and decided to give him a try. His books are crazy macabre with deep sexual overtones, but hey it's Horror and that's how these books taste best.

I liked how the characters in the small town and Patricia all had their own agendas, yet their stories came together at the end. First of all, the characters were real whackos, they did things I have never read before in books, how they enjoyd killing and raping, and  how the good ones suffered, but it just made for a more intense read. Everyone form the Sheriff, to her crush from childhood, to the Squatters and other locals was always a suspect in the gory deaths that kept occuring one after another. It was not easy to guess who did what, but Lee would describe some scenes from the point of view of the criminal, and they made for a very interesting reading. Usually you get the racap at the end,  but here you go along for the ride.

I loved the ending it was a real fast ride, and I just had to finish, there was no putting it down! 

I liked how Lee was not sparing characters, the most random main ones were in path of death, and I will not tell you if they met it, but you must check it out for yourself. 

-I would love to read a sequel, Patricia's character really intrigued me, and the last 2 pages were the best, total shocker, loved them! I would love to read more of the future unravelings
