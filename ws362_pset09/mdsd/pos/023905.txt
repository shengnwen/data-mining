Reading other reviews of this book, I had considered not purchasing this book. But I decided to go ahead and take a chance since many reviews did say that she was brutally honest. 

I am glad I did.

From the first few pages I realized that this was a good book. It was easy to read, the author had a great voice and I loved the tips throughout the book.

The book offers unvarnished advice on what will happen, what could happen and what might happen when a second child is introduced into the mix. Some things I knew intuitively. Some things I never considered.

For example, Ms. Leonard suggests making any changes to the first child's routine long before the second child comes into the picture to minimize the stess on the first child. As it a time up upheaval for the entire family, as much stability as you can give will help the first child adjust.

She tells us that jealousy is a normal reaction for the first born. To help relieve some of the jealousy, make sure that you allocate some time each day to give the child uninterupted, unorganized time with the first born. 

I will say that I always read three books on any subject to give me multiple points of view and found this book to be good, but not the best I read on having a second child. That distinction is given to Judy Dunn's From One Child to Two. In comparison, this book offered sound advice often through personal interviews that really drove home the author's points. But in comparison, Ms. Leonard's book included less information than Ms. Dunn's book. Thus if I was only going to read one book on the subject, I would suggest From One Child to Two. It is a denser book that takes more effort to read, but gives you much more to think about.
