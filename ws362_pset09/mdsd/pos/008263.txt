I picked this one up in fond memories of the Apprentice's first season and after a quick flip through the pages. Though the book presents nothing new in terms of concepts, they're certainly tried and true maxims of business.

The lessons don't appear to be "learned" from the show so much as the writers picked 10 lessons and supported them with Apprentice asides. Does this matter? No. But I was expecting much more Apprentice analysis and specific examples of actions and their resulting successes and failures.

The bottom line: a fun, quick read during spare time, but it could have been more
