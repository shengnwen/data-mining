Their from authors who teach us the truth.  Only Disney changes them and makes all the endings happy.  Happily Ever After-that is a fairy tale all in itself.  I read this when I was 6 or so.  I felt said for her too like every one else did.  I tried to save a dumped kitty in this horrible snow storm.  I don't think she made it so I bought this book to comfort me. I'm 42 and when it snows I imagine the older sick people with hypothermia and a late bill for heat.  That is creul.  I think that this book makes you understand death is not cruel, the people are. Death is a  better place to be, rejoiced and released of suffering.  I think it should be for teens.  Not for anyone younger, a good way to start to learn sympathy and empathy. You can not deny this happens
