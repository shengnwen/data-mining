I first read this book a few years ago. I gave my first issue to a member of our church. I wanted so much to read it again, I purchased another one. Believe it or not, I gave this one to someone also after I read it again. Now, I'm getting another copy to keep in my library. I have the desire to read it and the sequel "The Fourth Millenium". Even though it is written fictionally, there are many truths in it, regarding the end times. If you read your Bible along with it, it may just answer some questions to him or her who is seeking God. Excellent book
