This outstanding Broadway Playbill sized booklet, 64 pages in all, covers most of Manhattan only skipping East Harlem, and parts of Inwood. There is not much to fault these highly accurate maps containing landmark, shopping and entertainment information, except to say it is very colorful, informative, and detailed up to the point of information overload. The only one issue that can be a concern are the way Subway stations are marked, as red encircled "S"s with only the name of the Subway stop (not the subway line) listed next to it. To look up a subway station, one must refer to the included subway map. Also included in the guide is a map of the Bronx Botanical Gardens and Bronx Zoo, a map of Brooklyn's Prospect Park, neighborhood information, and a general calendar of events and festivals. rkchin. view more map reviews at http://www.nychinatown.org/bookstore/index6.htm
