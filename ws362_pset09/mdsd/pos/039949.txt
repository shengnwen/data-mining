I've read over a dozen personal accounts of fighter pilot's experiences from WWII. This one takes second seat to none. Goebel did a tremendous job of putting you there. From a young boy right out of high school, hopping freight trains and hitch hiking across the country, to a seasoned 21 year old double ace returning home and wondering how he will fit back into a world outside the air warrior fraternity, you are giving the opportunity to live those few years where young men came to define the words, Fighter Pilot Ace.
