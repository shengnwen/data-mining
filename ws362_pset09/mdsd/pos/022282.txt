The success of this book's argument turns very much on the point of whether group selection exists (even makes sense). As a professional biologist, I cannot concur with the other reviewer who indicates that the theory of group selection has been rehabilitated and is now established as &quot;fact.&quot; If group selection has been proved . . Hmmm . . . I must have been asleep when that happened. George Williams and others decades ago dealt this concept a stunning, perhaps death, blow. It has not, to date, recovered. Every time a case comes up that seems to be group selection at work, an alternative, individual selection explanation can be found which works just as well or better. It is much like Lamarckism: recurring wishful thinking that just won't die.
 
 Still, this doesn't stop the book or its premise from being intriguing
