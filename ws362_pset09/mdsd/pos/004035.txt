After romping through 27 essays (many really extended book reviews) about subjects as various as the End of the World in 2000, intelligent design (the antievolutionary version), conjurors, ufology, Freudianism, crazy congressmen and more, the inimitable Martin Gardner sort of spoils things by getting serious in his 28th and concluding essay on the limits, if any, of knowledge.

Come now. The kinds of nitwits who believe that, say, Carlos Casteneda really knew a shapeshifting shaman are never going to change their minds because they are exposed to a critical takedown, even by as skilled a wrestler with the nutty as Gardner. To treat these exposes as serious grappling with the ignorant enemy misses the point.

Their only genuine purpose is to give us smart people a good laugh. And laugh we do. Our motives are not any purer than our ancestors who visited Bedlam to laugh at the lunatics or Barnum & Bailey's sideshow to marvel at the freaks.

It may make the more sensitive uncomfortable, but the zanies and morons Gardner skewers so deftly were asking for it. Nobody made them sit down and write 900-page books predicting New York would be destroyed in 1994.

I thoroughly enjoyed these essays when they came out in Skeptical Inquirer over the years and was additionally amused by the Addenda Gardner apends about the reactions to his jibes.

But despite Gardner's 60 years of exposing crackpots, the density of crackpottery has not diminished one bit.
