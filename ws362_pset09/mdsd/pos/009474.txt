this book is not an easy read. it is full of information that provokes and ravages "comfort levels" that allow us to mindlessly tolerate the deep cruelty that goes on will not be ideas most people will want to entertain, but allowing oneself to entertain the idea that this sort of cruelty exploitation and violence can and does exist, if not in your day to day experience, somewhere in the world, should be enough to cause any person who still retains a morself of humanity outrage. As humans we have the ability to transcend survival of the fittest and exploiting the "weaker" for the needs of the stronger in our own human family, and this book removes the gauze from any eyes that may be confused about just how brutal life can be in the body of a woman in times and places where being such is not genuinely honored. This book IS like a  slap to the face, and upon first reading it can cause discomfort, but like a slap to someone in a daze, it's also sobering in it's unabashed straightforward call-it-as-it-is style. It makes  you realize how often communication especially by women is modified to be innocuous and palatable to the reader. At the very least this book is refreshing in that it is as far from that as it gets, but it's much more. It is important to the evolution of a society to name the subtle and flagrant violence and humiliation that is inflicted on some to keep others in power. This book does that. To call things as they are and point to how society is structured around a certain segment [namely males] at the expense of another is NOT doing so to demonize that segment but to name what goes on and point out that what society has allowed to be comfortable for men to believe is complicit and fine for women is not actually so. Only through truly knowing women in their own right and authenticity is it possible to have healthy relations between the sexes
