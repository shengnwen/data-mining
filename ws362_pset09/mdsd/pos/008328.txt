I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, and had never heard of Anne Tyler.  I was surprised how quickly I was totally engrossed in the novel.  While I have nothing in common with the heroine Delia, I could very easily get into her mindset and understand her.  I think most of us have had a day where we want to just chuck it all and walk away from our lives.

Well-written and believable, I enjoyed following Delia on her adventure, basically her "coming of age" even though her children should be going through that stage.  As much as I loved it, I really didn't care for the ending - the last two pages really ended abruptly and to me, not at all clearly. I felt like I must have missed something and read the last several pages three or four times to see what I'd missed, but it wasn't there.  

I still recommend this book
