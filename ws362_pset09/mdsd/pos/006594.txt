Again, the most descriptive writer of all times, Robert McCammon's imagination is outrageous!  A down and out Viet Nam Vet, in a moment of despair, kills a man and runs.  Meanwhile, a nasty man who runs a bounty hunter business sends two freaks after him. One of the freaks has a twin brother growing out of the side of his body.  They end up in the swamps where they encounter alligators and drug runners.  What a whopper of a great book and when I say you can't put it down, I kid you not.  Nobody can top the descriptions of McCammon.  You can feel, smell and taste with his novels.  Great reading!
