In his instructional book on writing fiction, Oakley Hall combines good, solid advice with self-congratulatory passages about his own writing.  The book is divided into two major parts:  "The Dramatic Method" and "Forms of Fiction", the last of which discusses the short story and the novel.  Most beginning writers will find the first part--and the bulk of the book--much more helpful than the last, although Hall's discussion of forms is worth reading for the distinctions it makes.

Within the first part, Hall breaks down his "secrets" into eight chapters:  Specification; The Senses; Words; Symbol and Indirection; Dialogue; Authority/Point of View; Characterization; Plot.  For every topic and sub-topic, he offers concrete, reliable advice followed by examples that illustrate his point.  His list of abstract sentences and their transformation to active, concrete ones is helpful in teaching the beginner the difference between bland sentences and the much more vivid demands of good fiction.  To his enormous credit, Hall includes nineteen pages on words and word choice, the foundation of writing but a topic often overlooked by amateurs.  His chapter on characterization is also strong.  Unfortunately, Hall bogs down at the end of chapters when he gives examples; too often, he includes his own writing and, even when he doesn't, he supplies little analysis to aid the reader in understanding the techniques.  The strength of this book lies in Hall's knowledge of his topics.  He provides small doses of real insight that his readers will be able to apply to their own writing. 

As a professor of writing, I have been looking for years for a good fiction textbook that is more affordable than Burroway's On Writing Fiction, and have yet to find one.  Hall's work, like many others, falls short.   Still, it offers some good lessons that aspiring fiction writers should read, even if the rest of the text is weak
