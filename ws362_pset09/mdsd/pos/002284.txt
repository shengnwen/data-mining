After reading `What Went Wrong? : The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East', I was impressed with Mr. Lewis' level of detail and clarity of writing on topics such as religion and modernity. Now, after completing `The Middle East', I'm reminded yet again of his talent to construct detailed historical account of the political, religious and socio-economic aspects of life in that region.  In this latest book, Mr. Lewis examines the major factors leading to the complexity of issues plaguing the Middle East today. 

Beginning with the rise of Islam in the 6th century and it subsequent spread to all neighboring kingdoms, the author examines the impact of a religion on the core structure of society, its influence over culture, art, the rationale behind the rivalry of Eastern states (then Persian now Iran) and the West (Syria, Egypt, then Anatolia- now Turkey), military conquests and the resulted political reforms. Readers will learn about the causes behind the low economic growth of the entire region (despite its rich oil reserves), about the 8-year war between Iran and Iraq, about the formation of the Jewish state and subsequently the country of Israel, about the numerous military conflicts in the region since 1949 and a host of other historical facts.

This book is complex in nature and requires a complex reader with deeper interests and even an advanced set of thought. It's great for history enthusiasts, students of the Middle Eastern societies, diplomats and/or businessmen planning to live and work in that part of the world.
