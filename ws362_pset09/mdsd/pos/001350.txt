Will Durant is one of the great macrohistorians and the scope of his work always gives a breadth of coverage to sociopolitical, economic, military, cultural and religious historical developments rather than simply a social or political history. He was frequently been accused of being too enamored with Western Civilization and not doing justice to other civilization in the conduct of his research, though I think this  first volume is a rather scrupulous charge. I first read this book in 2001, and have made it a frequent reference ever since. Various civilizations from Egypt, the Near East, India, China and Japan. Durant is especially attentive at drawing a picture of Mesopotamia and the early Sumerian civilizations. Persia's history is told with a storyteller's pen and Durant offers an insightful look at how the empire of Cyrus and Darius shaped world history. I found Japan's history to be rather fascinating. Durant covers the feudal developments under the Bushido code to Japan's ascendency to being a modern industrialized state that begins to challenge Western hegemony. The impact of Buddhism on India and surrounding nations is covered with remarkable clarity. Durant peels the clouded veneer of China's conservative sobriety and inclusiveness, in order to offer the reader much insight off of China. He covers hollowed antiquity from the Zhou Period onward to the grand Imperial regime. His insight on Confucian thought and Chinese philosophy is rather intriguing.

I think this book along with The Life of Greece is one of the Crown Jewels of the Story of Civilization sets. Durant is a secular humanist, so myself being a Christian, it is something you have to tolerate in his critique of the "People of the Book," though his insightfulness in other areas redeems his skepticism
