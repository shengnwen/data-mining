This was one of the best books I have ever read. The story is about a clone called Matteo Alcrán, who doesn't know anything of "real" life. Almost everyone hates him, El Patron wants to use him for transplants, and Felicia wants to kill him. Life couldn't get much worse, could it? Matt thinks he is different from other clones, and will not be used for transplants, but that would ruin the book... This is a great book, realistic fiction, and something or other.
