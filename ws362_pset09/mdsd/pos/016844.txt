Creative Nonfiction is an invaluable resource for writers of reality-based material.  I am a television producer and college film professor who specializes in documentary production.  While this book is crafted for a print writer, it is by far the best resource I have found for a complete review of the nonfiction creative process.  No film or television how-tos come close to the depth and insight of Gerard's work.  From formulating an idea to conducting an interview, from structuring a story to creating suspense, Gerard has articulated priceless insight to a process that is too often intuitive and hard to communicate.  A stunning achievement
