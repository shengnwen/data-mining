The Indian film industry is the largest film industry in the world making over 700 films every year in over 20 different languages. This book is a compendium of some of the greatest names in the Indian film industry along with summaries of some of the best films made in India from as early as 1897. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it as a reference book. It is a must for any major library
