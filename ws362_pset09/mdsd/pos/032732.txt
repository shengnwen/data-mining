I thought that The Nightingale Legacy was really good.  I preferred it much better then the first book in this series, The Wyndham Legacy.  I really enjoyed the characters in this book.  At the start of the book Caroline is an innocent girl who is about to be attacked by her uncle.  While on the run from her uncle she meets North and quickly realizes that she wants him.  Although North had decided that he didn't want to marry for several more years he couldn't resist the charms of Caroline for very long.  There are many secrets & mysteries in this book that will keep you guessing until the very end.  I was happy realize that my guess was right as to who the villain was but there's more to it then what you'd think.  I was also pleased to see Marcus & The Duchess return in the last half of the book.  It was quite enjoyable.  The only thing that I really didn't care for was the bit of magic at the end of the book.  I don't like any magic in my books but it was small enough that it didn't make that big of a difference.  I would recommend this book
