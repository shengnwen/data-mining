This book is a pretty good read. It is not a first person account but stands alone fairly well.  It wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the battle of Iwo Jima. It's well written, well documented and has a host of photographs that are not that common in other books on the subject. 

I did have some minor technical issues with the book, but I think they were based on the fact this book was written by the nephew of a combat veteran and not the man himself. These in no way overshadowed the value of this book. 

Accounts of the Pacific War aren't as common as those from Europe so I will recommend the following. Goodbye Darkness, Helmet for my Pillow, With the Old Breed, and Flags of our Fathers.
