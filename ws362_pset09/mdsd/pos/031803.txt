I love to read anything Chuck Klosterman writes, even if he can sometimes be inconsistent.  That being said, this book is frickin' great and is not the reason I find his writings occassionally inconsistent.  I always recommend this to people who enjoy anything about pop culture and or just generally funny reads.  So far everyone I have recommended it to has become Chuck fans!
