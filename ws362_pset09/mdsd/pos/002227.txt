Wow.  Radical, indeed.  The etymology is apropos;  radical comes from the Latin radix, meaning root.  Mosher gets to the root of all sorts of subjects with his witty style and erudition.  This guy knows his stuff.  If there is any grain or sugar or spice or herb in this world that has ended up in a brewpot, Mosher has probably written about it.

At the risk of turning this review section into a lovefest, I agree with the other reviewers.  If you've never brewed before, get a good basic text;  you can't do better than Palmer's How to Brew, and he's generous enough to put the entire text on line for free perusal--although you'll probably want to go ahead and get a hard copy just for convenience. Others will have their own preferences for a basic brewing book.   I started out a couple of decades ago with Papazian's book, and it's fine--but I think Palmer's is a tad better.

One theme Mosher stresses is how the homebrewer can afford to use the best ingredients for his brew, something a corporate brewer can't.  So what if using Maris Otter malt and lots of noble hops might make that batch cost a few cents more?  You can afford it, and can make a brew that no big corporation would ever make.

If I were just starting out today,  I'd probably spring for Palmer's book and this one by Mosher.  Between those two you'd be able to brew virtually any style you want to.  Plus, after reading Radical Brewing you'd have more esoteric beer knowledge than any sane person needs. But who ever said that homebrewers were sane
