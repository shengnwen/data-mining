&quot;Putting on the Break&quot; has helped several of my students/clients understand what is really happening when they can not stop.  One student's  mom said, &quot;This is the first time I see Laura interested in a book,  any book.  She explained why she has trouble paying attention like a pro.  Thanks.&quot;  The book gives the children a perspective they can relate  to.  Adults can be too wordy, the books helps them &quot;see&quot; and  &quot;feel&quot; about ADHD.  Thanks for making the book available in  Spanish.  We need more for the Spanish- speaking population
