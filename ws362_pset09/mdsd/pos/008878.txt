I rarely read the work of lesser known authors, but this one came recommended by a friend. The Time Keeper was a quick read and impossible to put down, a perfect book to have when travelling. The relationships between Corey and his friends, his coach, his father and most importantly his mother, aren't always comfortable, but they are REAL. Everyone's human experience is different, but I was glad I had an opportunity to catch a glimpse of Corey's, or maybe it was Kevin's if this was at all based on his own life experience. Thank you for the wonderful read Kevin!!! I look forward to your next work
