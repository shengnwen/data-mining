William Gibson burst onto the scene with slick writing and a dismal view of the future.  His protagonists were all flawed and the endings resulted in bittersweet Pyrrhic victories - a world were pain begets pain.  Mostly set in the criminal underground or the criminal corporate world at war, he explored the darkness in his future worldview and the darkness within each of us.

What I liked best about this collection is what I like best about all of Gibson's work, the fluid prose.  Like liquid poetry injected directly into the consciousness it raises your pulse and quickens the anticipation.  He's brilliant at creating a mood, a true master.  

The highlight of this anthology was the title story, Burning Chrome.  To describe it with words like octane and infused would be to weaken its impact, a pure rush of language that conveys the story of desire: wealth, sex, life.  There may be no better story in the genre than Burning Chrome.  

Of the other stories, Johnny Mnemonic and Hinterlands stood out as exciting rides of fictional craziness.  Hinterlands was half-horror, half cyber, and full out corporate espionage.  Johnny Mnemonic foreshadowed Neuromancer with the introduction of Molly and the ill-fated Johnny run cross of the true corporate power in Gibson's stories, the Yakuza.  

The rest of the collection is a fine sampling of Gibson's writing.  Some better than others.
