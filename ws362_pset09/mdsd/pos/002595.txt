I think  this book is great, it addresses the children involved in infidelity much more than any other book I have read.  It also explores how people can react when you confide in them.  I honestly think this is the very first book people should read upon discovering an infidelity.  It can act as a great guide post keeping the situation from getting any worse than it already is.  Pretty quick read, and VERY helpful.
