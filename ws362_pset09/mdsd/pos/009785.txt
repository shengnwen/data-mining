This text was required reading for my college freshman year critical thinking class (over 15 years ago) and I highly recommend it for students. The approach to problems and issues is very methodical and forces one to consider styles that may complement the habitual.

I've found myself coming back to the book when feeling "stuck" with a problem and feeling like I was not tapping the full range of creative solutions that could at least be considered.  Our minds are naturally lazy and reach for the common or habitual answers - it's not a bad thing, it may just be the result of successful evolutionary survival to have gotten us to this point.  Putting the discipline this book will teach you to use consistently will give you a structure to guide extra effort towards solving problems for which the same old answers fail to satisfy you.

Contrary to some of the criticism I've read here, I believe the author addresses how emotions can be used and incorporated in the process rather than being suppressed or ignored.  One area that I believe the author can improve, is in the use of visuals* such as a process map or visual overview for the problem solving process.  This would make the material more accessible, powerful and memorable. I've found in the workplace that creating visual flowcharts for business processes can enhance communication, absorption and adherence to the "best practices" you recommend.  I plan to contact the author with this suggestion.

Hope you enjoy the book,

*I have an older edition and this gap may have already been addressed by the author in subsequent versions.
