Steven Woodworth has produced a book about the Union's most successful army that will stand the test of time. He has managed to show us both the big picture - the grand strategy and the movements of the armies, as well as the lives of the individual private soldiers. There is enough detail in "Nothing But Victory" to satisfy even the most detail-oriented Civil War buff, but the great sweep and panorama of the war are not lost in a morass of minutiae.

Most of all, the Civil War is a great story - and Steven Woodworth is a great story teller. "Nothing But Victory" is beautifully written and will take its well-earned place on my bookshelf next to Catton's Army of the Potomac Trilogy and Freeman's "Lee's Lieutenants"
