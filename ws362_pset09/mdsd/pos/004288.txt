I became interested in &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; when I found out his mother was distantly related to my family and I was researching my family.  He was raised 25 miles from where I live until his family moved to Oklahoma.  There was mention of the town in the book and some of the mischief he got in to.  The house they lived in still stands.  I was able to use some of the information from the book to go in my family tree.  The book was very well written and seemed to be accurate in the account given of his life.   I felt like I had known him from the reading of this book and feel he was unjustly killed at the end.  His mother was treated unfairly about the way the funeral took care of his body.  The pictures in the book of his family in the younger days were very good pictures.  I didn't especially care for the ones at the funeral home where he was more or less put on display. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the history and hardships that occurred during the early part of the century.I am sure I will read this book again. It was hard to put down when I read it the first time
