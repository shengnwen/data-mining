I think this is the best of the series. It is real easy to read which I like because you can finish it fast. It has some great lessons and makes some wonderful points about investing for future retirement. Anyone can learn something from this that they can put to good use. 

There are a lot of generalities in this book but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. If you had to choose between this one and the first one I would choose this one. They both will get you thinking in terms of the big picture instead of the minute details of everyday life. I am currently investing in rental property and agree with the author that you must have positive cash flow in order to invest, which in a lot of markets you can't do right now. 

Anyway this book will get you started down the road in the right direction which I must say a lot of them won't
