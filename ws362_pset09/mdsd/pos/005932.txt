Saying typical Georgette Heyer is an accolade that most authors will never receive.  Ms. Heyer writes her Regency romances with grace, wit and humor.  While this is not my favorite one of her books, it contains all the elements to make it an outstanding romance novel by any other standards.  Her heroes are always attractive, strong and compelling and her heroines are spirited and  lively.  Always a "fun" read
