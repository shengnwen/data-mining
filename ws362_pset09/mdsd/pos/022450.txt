Excellent book! I had no idea that provenance could be so exciting!  Ms. Ulrich is detail oriented and that is definitely a plus.  She'll begin talking about a seemingly simple basket then launch into a social history of the place, people and time that basket was used by examining articles and announcements in the newspaper lining the basket.  Brilliant!  I learned so much about our America that I didn't know.  Lemuel Haynes, revered 18th century black Reverend, wow! I was shocked and amused to find that people were struggling with what to do with the homeless back in 1795! What a complex and interesting place we live in.  As a huge fan of American history I found this book to be a treasure.  Read it if you want to know more about your American self
