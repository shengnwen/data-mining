i believe it is in this book that mr. hornby states that he hates [...] reviewers. well, i, fluffy the human being, am one of those, and if mr. hornby hates me, then he hates me. such is the universe. fluffy the human being has a huge forgiving spirit though, and i forgive the man. i happen to love this book of his. i love reading about what other people are reading, and i am not kidding at all. this little book is a breezy, sweet read. if i keep living, i will probably read it again someday (yes, i liked it that much)
