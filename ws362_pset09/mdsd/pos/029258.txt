I found this book very helpful up until I was given then news that I did not get pregnant.  In this book four couples became pregnant the first time out.  One couple eventually gave up.   Another couple was introduced off the cuff as the "try again" set they were not even given names, but referred to as wife and husband.  It seems that a good quarter of the book is devoted to the pregnancy, which I never got to.  I am glad that this book is out there.  It covers the process and is helpful for positive outcomes.  I did not find any solace in the negative outcome here.  Also, all the couples are childless before IVF.  As a person with secondary infertility, I would have liked the book to cover children during IVF
