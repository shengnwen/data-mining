This is by far the single greatest, most inspiring piece of literature in the history of the world. If you haven't read it, buy it and read it NOW. If you're a stiff who can't think past when the next Jerry Springer episode comes on, don't even bother. Otherwise this is it. Nothing beats it. ever. buy it. read it. love it. live it
