Peter Hessler's book, Oracle Bones: A Journey Between China's Past and Present, gives the reader a wonderful look into changing China.  I recently spent 3 weeks touring China--I had not been in China since 1994 and was amazed at the cultural and economic changes.  On my travels, I read Hessler's book -he explained those changes.  His words and stories rang true as I attempted to discover and understand this Asian giant.   Hessler does a wonderful job connecting the past to the present.    He uses the life stories of scholars  connected to Oracle Bone research to tell China's tumultuous history.  Hessler also follows the lives of his former students and other Chinese friends in China's new economy.  Their lives not only teach the history of this ancient land but also gives us insight into the impact that China's changing economy and culture has on its people.   Hessler's book weaves the stories of these scholars, and people trying to gain success in China's new economy,  to describe China today.  

I have read many books on China and this is one of my favorites.  The only reason I am rating the book a four instead of a five is that I believe it may be difficult to follow if the reader is not familiar with basic Chinese history and important political figures, especially the post-1949 period.  But, if you are interested at all in the China preparing itself to host the 2008 Summer Olympics--the China ready to show itself to the world as a "first class nation"--I recommend this book for your reading list
