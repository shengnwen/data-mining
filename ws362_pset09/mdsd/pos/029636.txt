While I greatly enjoyed reading ZORBA and loved its title character, I could not help but think that its author is in some way twisted in his thinking. The villagers' treatment of Madame Hortense and of the widow is shocking in both the book and the excellent movie by Cacoyannis. If Kazantzakis is himself a Cretan like the villagers, why does he present them as so vile?

The author is also markedly anti-clerical. Zorba's dealings with the monastery above the village are nothing less than aiding and abetting in the crime of arson: He works on an addled monk to burn down the monastery, and provides him with paraffin to make the flames burn more intensely.

While I am on this negative train of thought, I found the author's treatment of his women characters uncomfortably misogynistic. Curiously, Zorba is much more open-minded than Kazantzakis appears to be. 

On the other hand, Zorba is a vital character whose every word and act makes for excitement on the printed page. I could easily have read another 500 pages in the same vein, but such is not to be.

The pictures I have seen of Kazantzakis show him to be a rather forbidding looking individual. I wonder how it is that the strange mixture of attraction and meanness could appear in the same face, and yet it does
