The book on elvis presley was a interesting book. I enjoyed it, but there was somethings that i did not like about too much. One thing that i did not like about the book is that it first starts talking about him preforming and becoming a rock and roll king in the first chapter and than in the second chapter it talks about when he was born and the rest of his life. This way of talking about the facts of his life were confusing to me and probably other people that have read this book. That is preaty much all of the things that i dont like about the book. The book has a time line in it which is very good thing. The book on elvis had alot of good details. Some of the details that the book included was that he was born on January 8, 1935 in tupelo mississippi, that he moved to memphis tennessee in the year of 1948, that in 1954 he becomes the "King of Rock and Roll", 1956 he has his first tv apperacne, 1960 he complets tour of duty and returns to the united stateson march 2, 1961 he preformes a concert in Honolulu, Hawaii, He was devoriced on October 9,1973, and then in 1977 he gives his last concert on june 26 but he also is killed by overdose in the same year. Some of major chracters in this book were Elvis and his mom, dad, his wife Priscilla, his only daughter Lisa Marie.
He was devoriced on October 9,1973, 1979 his father Vernon dies and his ex-wife priscilla and daughter Lisa Marie inherit the presley estate
