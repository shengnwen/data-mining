My kids are big fans of "Artemis Fowl" and "Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches." My youngest is always read or re-reading one of the books. I picked up Half-Moon thinking the kids would devour it, but they didn't (at least not at first). I read it and it reminded my of an old Columbo detective story with a bit of Encyclopedia Brown thrown in. As an adult, I thought it was a good story for kids and quite fun
