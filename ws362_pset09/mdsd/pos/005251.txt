This book is very well written and someone with a highschool education can use the money saving concepts in their current job, to secure their future tomorrow. It's all about taking you back to the basics of retirement planning! If you think about how your parents worked, saved, retired, this book gives you the "inspiration" that you can create a nest egg in todays world, and you can retire equal or better than you lived.

Brain talks about success stories and examples of how people achieved financial security while only holding mid to low paying jobs. If you make a middle to low income, it will show you how pennys today can secure your future tomorrow!

Never think that you are below others based on your occupation. You can read how a janitor or disabled person and retire without worry when they come of age.

I hope you enjoy it, I found it inspiring
