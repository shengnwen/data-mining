Selove's memoir is short and sweet. I especially liked the style of writing, which seems to match and convey her nonchalant but passionate outlook on life. The book is short and to-the-point. It's honest and thought-provoking. 

The obstacles that she faced as a physicist may not be as pertinent today, but they still do exist. The book would provide an excellent read for male and female students and faculty members at major science institutions, especially physics departmental personnel.

I recommend the book to anyone who has the chance to read it
