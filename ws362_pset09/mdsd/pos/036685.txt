I did not expect to like this book.  Even though I bought it.  I'm the type of person who has to read the complete series, so I ordered it, read the back then decided I didn't want to read it.  It sat on my TBR pile for about 2-3 weeks.  Finally, after finishing a contemporary series I decided to return to Regency times.  

I liked it!  It was a very nice addition to the Boscastles, who aren't always the nicest protagonists. It is both fun and funny.  

I've never really liked Devon in the other books, and didn't think he would make an engaging hero, but he does.  It helps that he is immediately attracted to Jocelyn.  He took his commitment to her seriously, once he'd accidently compromised her
