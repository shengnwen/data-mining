I enjoyed the novel very much.  Mitch Rapp is an excellent author, but he needs better proof readers.  I could not believe the number of errors that I noticed as I was reading.  I would love to offer my services, but I do not know where to make that request.  I did go to his web sight and found an email address but no response from it.  I taught high School English for thirty-eight years and read thousands of essays for seniors.  This is not the forum for this complaint, but I know no other.  Thanks.  Dale B. Hage
