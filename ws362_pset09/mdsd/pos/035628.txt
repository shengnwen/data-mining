I'm lesbian, not gay but I have mant gay friends.and being 73 now I lived thru the McCarthyite era, the witch hunts, being scared to go to gay bars which were likely to be raided (REALLY!) and the fear of losing your job if you were discovered. It was a chilling time and the author tells it like it was.  We HAVE come a long way, baby!! Read this book to discover how it was like to be gay/lesbian back in the Dark Ages when homosexuality was a psychiatric disorder.  BORN TOO LATE!
