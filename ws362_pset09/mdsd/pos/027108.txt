My daughter really likes this book. She likes all the books that we have by Eric Carle. My only complaint is, I wish it had more words. There isn't any story to it at all. It's just counting. But maybe it's that simplicity that my 2 1/2 yr old likes. Overall, I have to say good book because it is something she will sit and listen to
