The Last Algonquin is a sad but heartwarming story about a man and his attempts to come to grips with his place in the world.  The fact that this man, Joe Two Trees, is the last of his tribe of the Algonquin's makes his journey that much harder and more interesting.  If you are looking for an official history of the American Indians, this isn't the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a deep and touching story of one American Indian, and what we as a nation have lost by ignoring the heritage of American Indians, then you will enjoy this book.  Mr. Kazimiroff has done an excellent job of preserving the story given to him by his father and keeping the memory of Joe Two Trees and the Algonquin Indians alive
