The Ides of April is a historical fiction story by Mary Ray. Ray uses her unique skill to write a beautifully laced murder mystery in Rome 62 AD. Hylas is a young slave in the household of Caius Pomponius, a Roman senator. One horrible night, Caius is murdered in his sleep and all the slaves are rounded up and sent to prison to be murdered, except Hylas and Assinius, who disappeared right after the murder. Camillus, a military tribune, Varro, a porter, and Caius's aunt, Matidia, befriend Hylas. Together they race against time to find the murderer, bring him to justice, and free all the slaves kept in the dank and rotting prison. Ray creates an interesting ancient murder story by intertwining the glory of the Roman Empire with the death and destruction that comes with it, but, unfortunately, she introduces too many characters with similar names all at the same time which causes much confusion to the reader and makes it hard for them figure out who is who and who did what. Ray also creates the characters as though to make them distant from the reader. She creates them without any feelings so that the reader cannot say, "Yeah, I can relate to that." But, all in all, this is a good book because of the way Ray adds a gripping plot and twists and turns at every page. This story will interest younger teens and adults. I highly recommend it.
