If you're looking for unusual, beautiful mittens to make, this is the book for you. The patterns are adaptations of traditional styles and designs from around the world, with well-written directions and explanations of various techniques. Most of them, however, require time and patience to complete, so if you're trying to whip up a few pairs as gifts, these are probably too complicated. But any of them would make a very special gift. Lovely collection
