A fascinating description of the innovation process, carefully written with warmth & personality to avoid the cookbook style of traditional 'how to do it' books.  Robert has crafted a serious message interspersed with real world experiences (both personal and the grand masters of innovation) in small and large organizations.  When you're done reading this, you'll improve your own creativity, and you'll know how to work with others to accomplish innovation as you've not considered reasonable before.  Overall, a pleasant read with a valuable message
