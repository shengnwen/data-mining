I have read countless self-help books; some I have taken to heart and others I have not.  This work I found to be very interesting and enlightened me in many ways. The author gives you some clear  revelations concerning conflicts that you will encounter in life; the emotions you will deal with and the why's of feeling as you feel. 
He explains the concept of the 'power struggles' that we have within ourselves, and how important it is to work to understand them and make the necessary changes.
It is always hard to see ourselves as others see us, our flaws and weaknesses; but with understanding, comes the ability to change.
 
I enjoyed this work and plan on doing a little more study with this book and some self-examining.  I think this book would profit all that take the time to read it and put into practice what is being told them.  An interesting spin, not boring, but very insightful.
