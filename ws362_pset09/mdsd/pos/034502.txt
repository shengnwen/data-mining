This book provides a nice method for picking two kinds of promising stocks: rule-breakers, the next cisco, microsoft, or amazon; innovative, up and coming companies with enormous potential for growth: and rule-makers, solid, established companies, leaders in their fields, that promise steady profit and earnings. The authors give a list of the attributes to look for that identify each kind of company. It's valuable advice, but the book is full of that "irrational exuberance" that characterized the late 90s.
