I couldn't wait to receive this book after ordering it from Amazon. From the other reviews I had read, I was excited about seeing all the mouth-watering recipes. After all, one needs to have some incentive to eat raw food over and over again. And, I wasn't disappointed.

The first recipe I concocted was on page 186 'Orange-Date Dessert Bars'. YUMMY. Fun to fix and delicious to eat. As a matter of fact, the taste was very similar to some health-food bars for which I pay $2.85 EACH. So, right away I probably made up for the cost of the book. (Not including ingredients)

Anyway, the photos are, indeed, incredible and will easily help you decide which recipes to try first. There's such an assortment of salads, soups, and drinks that anyone can find something they like.

I don't have an expensive professional juicer. I use a Juiceman Jr. and I have a Cuisinart Blender/Processor Combo, which I found sufficient for use with the recipes found here. After using the blender, I poured the puree into a sieve and mashed it down with a wooden spoon to release as much juice at possible.

I'm very happy with the purchase of this book and plan to share it with others ( at least temporarily) to motivate them into getting 'healthy', too.
