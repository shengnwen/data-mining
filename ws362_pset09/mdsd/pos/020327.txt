If nothing else, this book brings a new awareness of the struggles that the Chechen people have faced over the last decade or more with Russia.  I do not claim to know anything about Putin, but this book does not paint a very flattering picture of the man behind the war.  A lot of food for thought and insights into the plight of the oppressed Chechens.  An excellent book but not the best one on the market about Chechnya
