This cookbook has some good recipes, but a good deal of it is too involved for day to day use, unless you're the type of person who lives to cook.  Many of the recipes use imitation cheese, which always turns out tasting second rate.  Others require many different ingredients but use only a little of each, so you have to figure out what to do with all the excess you didn't use.  In addition, some of the recipes such as the hummus and miso soup include modifications that make them more complicated than normal for beginners.  Overall, not a bad cookbook, but it can be frustrating for beginners or people who don't generally like to cook
