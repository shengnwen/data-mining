Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor is probably the best book on investing available, but buffetology is the easier version of Graham's, so i love it three times as much. it's so easy that i could read it while laying on the Bali beach in a recent holiday. caution though, maybe because it's so simple it's probably too simple for sophisticated ones out there.
