What's good - great fun to read, good insight into tactical desicion making, some nice historical perspectives, interesting characters and great presentation of conflict

What's not so good - the evil kid (Achilles) does not have enough background to adequately explain his actions.  Peter Wiggins is also poorly explored.

Other :  The Ender series is loosely based on an idea that very, clever children are capable of providing answers to questions that adults can't.  This mindset has become very popular of late.  When you run out of ideas - let someone or something else make the decisions.  

Card is well bright enough to provide an aged nun, Sister Carlotta, to temper the ego of child genius.

Children will love it and adults should hope to learn from it.

Engaging, clever and timely; we are lucky to have Orson spinning fine yarns.
