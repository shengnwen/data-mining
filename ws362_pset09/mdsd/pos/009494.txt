Before I begin, I must state, that I have read this book... unlike many Amazon 'reviewers.'

With that said, it's a fun book... but doesn't read like a novel. I kept this book in the bathroom, and feel that it's a great bathroom book. No, not because it's full of crap... har har har... lame. But because you can read about one or two people -depending on your, let's say, ahem... schedule- and come back to it later without feeling like you've lost your place.

Goldberg profiles people humorously, but with clear purpose and lighthearted seriousness... if that makes sense. He is clearly to the right of center, but doesn't list or demean people, just because he disagrees. He saves that for the people who do things that are so far out of the mainstream as to be offensive. The list is most often comprised of people guilty of the same crime; whether it be un-apologetic America bashers, over zealous feminists and abortion activists, and those celebrities (including actors, politicians, and news personalities) who've no longer fight for a cause, but instead fight against those whom disagree, or deny all their biases altogether.

Bottom line-- It's best read in small doses, and with the understanding that it's meant to be a fun book, rather than words to live by
