I'm still looking through this book but I mainly like the styles to play with. (I didn't have to pay for this book, it was given to me but I don't normally buy these "instant effects" things....I have to know how an effect is created and why)

In my opinion, this is a "fun" type of book to have especially if you want to get right to doing fun/cool things without having to do any hardcore thinking...it's for those who don't really need to know "how"...just that they "can".

It's fun =
