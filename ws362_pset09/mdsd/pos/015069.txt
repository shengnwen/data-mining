This book is hard to put down, and yet it is hardly high literature. In most parts it is badly written and/or translated. Junger also has little time for describing other humans beyond a cursory description. Not that he spends much more time describing his own character. The impression one gets of him is a (one dimensional) caricuture of a German typically found in British or American war comics. 
And yet I recommend you read this book because I doubt Junger has fabricated anything in his account. The action sequences are represented brilliantly. It is only when one of his comrades die (and that is often) that one realises how much is missing from his remembrance
