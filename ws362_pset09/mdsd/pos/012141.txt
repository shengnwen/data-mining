What a great book!

The book, newsletter, and website are all very interesting and useful. The book is 48 chapters (about 1000 pages) full of corporate finance. I have to agree with the authors "It is a book in which theory and practice are constantly set off against each other...."

I really like it. Especially the emphasis not so much on techniques ("which tend to shift and change over time.")

Moreover, the authors also put out a monthly newsletter and have a web site that could stand alone as one of the best in the business
