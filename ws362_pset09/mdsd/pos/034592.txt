This book with mainly two things in mind: communication and understanding. The author's adopt their longstanding research about the world of typewatching into an intelligible book about the main areas of the work environment such as problem solving, conflict resolution, time management, etc.

Any manager that has direct reports would do themselves a favor by reading this book. This book will also provide support for a subordinate that doesn't quite "fit in." For those hurried types, each chapter ends with guidlines in a charted format for working with those of other preferences. Although this is somewhat useful, what I don't like about the approach is that they focus on the four preferences instead of focusing on the four major groupings, forcing the reader to combine and study the effects. For example, the charts will explain how an E should lead an I, etc. I believe that it would be much more useful to categorize the charts by the four major groups (e.g. NF's, NT's, SJ's, SP's) and how to interact with other types in each subject area.

To the author's credit, the book does provide an overview on the major strengths and potential weaknesses of each of the 16 types in the workplace, for those who aren't familiar with the MBTI. However, it does not really provide a concrete method of determining type, leaving the reader somewhat guessing with the use of anecdotal phrases.

Overall, I find this book well worth the investment. However, I would not recommend this book as an introduction to typewatching. If you are familiar with type, the specific chapters will be meaningful, if not, pick up either the precursor to this book by the same author's or one of David Keirsey's works prior to reading this
