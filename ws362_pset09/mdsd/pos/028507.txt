"When a woman's fed up 
There ain't nothing you can do about it 
It's like running out of luck 
Then it's too late to talk about it."

Kim is a woman fed up.  She's been with Alan for over a year.  Things are good, but for Kim, they could be better.  They enjoy each others company.  The sex is good.  They travel around the world together.  She even has clothes at his house.  But Alan won't give her the one thing she wants...a commitment.  At a cross road in her life, Kim is fed up and must decide if she's willing to settle for what Alan is giving, or if she wants more, even if that means moving on.  What is Kim going to do?

"I'm standing here looking in the mirror saying damn to myself
I should have known the day would come that she would find somebody
else
And all the things I took her through ---- I shouldn't have lasted
this long."

Alan has goals and aspirations and right now those don't include a committed relationship with Kim or any other woman.  Afraid of making the same mistakes of his father, Alan is about business regardless of Kim's feelings, wants and needs.  If Kim can't deal with what he's offering, then maybe she needs to do her own thing.  Is Alan ready for Kim to do her own thing?

Being the R.Kelly fan I am, the title alone had me.  Having read Darrin's previous novels, I knew R would be tied in here somehow.  When a Woman's Fed Up made for a quick and tantalizing read.  I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I would have liked a little less sex and a little more story.  Also, at times, the book seemed a little rushed, particularly towards the end.  But as always, Darrin captures readers attention from beginning to end.  Chicago's favorite bartender Adrienne makes a guest appearance.  The soundtrack was nice.  Look forward to his next book
