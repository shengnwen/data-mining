Well versed and thought out, this book stands out and has been used in many of todays religion studies.  Though some of his points can be perceived as "stretched", he is still a scholar in his field.  It seems that the people that often criticize him and his works have little to no experience or education on the subject at hand and do it solely on the fact that it sometimes criticizes the monotony of modern and ancient religion.  I recommend this book to everyone. Read the book and make your own educated determination. It could open your eyes and your mind.  Or you can close your mind, avoid the book, and start a "crusade" against the author for speaking his opinion.
