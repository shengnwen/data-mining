Whether or not you started with Daggerspell or if you have just recently started reading the works of Katharine Kerr, you should definately read this.  I found the book entertaining with all the old characters mixed with the new and their wonderful skill at getting wound up in problems that seem  to large to remedy.  You get to see parts of her world that you do not see  in the other books which is always exciting with this author.  She  transends into the world &quot;high fantasy&quot; well and the ending is  rather different from most of her others because it is sudden and leads  into the next book
