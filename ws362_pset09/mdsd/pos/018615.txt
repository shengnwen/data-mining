Fletcher's Conversion of Europe is a treasury of &quot;strange but true&quot; stories.  For instance, St. Patrick was not Irish - at least not by birth. He probably came from Britain.  Also, despite the best intentions of Papal messengers, only one country, Portugal, abandoned &quot;pagan&quot; names for the days and months (e.g. Thursday = Thor's day; March = month of Mars).  And the piece de resistance: those who brought the True Faith to Germany were reluctant to teach ALL of the bible to the Hun, for fear that the gory bits in the Old Testament - especially the Wars of David - would arouse their savage instincts.  Every corner of Europe is explored - including Iceland (assuming we can call that Europe!).     This is a terrific resource for those interested in the Dark Ages and early Medieval period
