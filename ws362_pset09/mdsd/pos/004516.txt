My little guy is 6 months old and has adored this book for at least two months. The rhymes always make him smile. I agree that it is a bad message about being too big or too small for activities, and that broccoli stew is "ew!", but I use it as a learning experience (hippos don't like broccoli stew, but it is yummy for bunnies and little boys!). I have it memorized so if he gets upset while stuck in traffic, I can recite it to him and make him smile. I am ordering more of Boynton's books now
