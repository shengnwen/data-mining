I enjoyed this book and found that although I have lived through much of what was discussed, I now have a much greater appreciation of the totality of Prem Rawat's work. (I have been inspired by Maharaji since 1978). The book shows how hard Maharaji has worked to fulfill his father's wish, to bring a knowledge of inner peace to anyone, anywhere who is interested. The style is easy and straightforward, the index useful
