Timothy J. Gilfoyle's City of Eros looks at New York City in its &quot;century of prostitution&quot;, roughly from 1820 to 1920.  He gives much more than a narrative history (although certainly many personalities and stories do shine through) as he looks at the broader picture and includes a taste of nineteenth sociology, a dash of its politics, and a smidgen of its literature and culture as it pertains to sex.  Through the entire book, the most strongly drawn character becomes New York City itself as the reader is almost invited to see a city that is teeming with commercial sex throughout the entire island of Manhattan.  The commercialization of sex, despite the efforts of vice puritans, changes more because the city changes.  It was interesting to see the commercialization of sex tied in with other forms of commerical enterprise.  A fitting companion to this book would be The Murder of Helen Jewett by Patricia Cline Cohen.  Read Timothy Gilfoyle's book for the broader picture and Patricia Cohen's for some of the finer, more personal details.  A wonderful read with much information
