First, all these Soho mystery paperbacks are excellent,including the book design! Murder in the Sentier belongs among the top European mysteries, and C. Black's series is right up there with Simenon's Maigret, from decades back. Higher praise does not exist! Our odd and flamboyant German/French late 20's Detective/Computer Expert Heroine meets a shady lady, who may have some secrets about our heroine's mother, and any part she played in a near defunct 1970's Terrorist group. Unfortunately, the shady lady is shot dead while waiting to meet Aimee at a Paris Cemetary. The rest is a fine whodunnit, plus very fine scenes in the Sentier neighborhood, along with a motley crew of  Parisians of many sorts, from Bourse traders, Coffee House Turks, and Street People of all sorts. Stylistically, this is way above many competitors in the Euro-Mystery field, and really a pleasure to read thruout! One of the final scenes may have been a bit predictable to an old mystery hand, but still done with real polish and flair throughout! In fact, this is one of the few mysteries good enough to merit a re-reading, which I might do soon
