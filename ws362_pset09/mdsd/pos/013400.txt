Patriot Games is a fast-paced, for the most part, book about the world of international terrorism. This book by Tom Clancy is a worthwhile read.

One of the best yet slowest parts of this book is work done in the CIA. This book does a great job of showing you how the job of antiterrorism/counterintelligence is done. It shows how the CIA functions by using the satellites, luck, and the smallest details to break a case, as with Action-Directe. 

This novel goes into detail about how split-second decisions are made. It also talks about the conscience effects of these decisions hours, days, and months later. It does a great job of analyzing both the decision making process and the effects of these decisions.

The action in this book is also very fast and intense. Not only is the action captivating; it teaches you how and why terrorist attacks are made. This book describes the planning and the process of a terrorist attack, not only the shooting part but also the intelligence and timing aspects. The action also shows how police and other agencies respond to a terrorist attack. Not only during the attack but also after the attack.

Perhaps William H. Webster said it best, "Behind all the political rhetoric... we are bringing home one unassailable fact- terrorist is a crime by any civilized standard, committed against innocent people." Now more than ever, the world of international terrorism is encompassing all of us
