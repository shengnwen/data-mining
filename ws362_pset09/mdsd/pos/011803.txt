This is an extraordinary book, on many levels.  It is a concise abridgement of a much longer work and a fine, readable translation of the original 16th century Italian.  More importantly, the substance is  priceless.  This is nothing less than a guided tour of the amazing events  of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, from a clear-eyed, surprisingly  objective reporter who knows whereof he speaks.  Guicciardini was, among  other things, Machiavelli's assistant and an adviser to popes.  Writing  from the vantage point of his personal observation of the events of his  lifetime, he discusses:  the Medici, the building of the dome of St.  Peter's for the jubilee of 1500, the related sale of indulgences, the  ensuing &quot;Lutheran heresy,&quot; the discovery of the new world, Henry  VIII's divorce and the ensuing separation of the Church of England, and the  arrival of syphillis in Europe, among other topics.  Be warned that it is  dense material, but it is worth the effort
