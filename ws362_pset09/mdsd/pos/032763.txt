Okubo's book is a valuable eyewitness account of a sad period of U.S. history, the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans during WWII.  I don't know anything about Okubo's life, but her book suggests she was one of  those relocated.  The book is illustrated on every page with great,  expressive pen-and-ink drawings, and each picture is accompanied by a  caption thoroughly explaining the scene depicted.  The story begins with  her family awaiting relocation orders, being sent to two different camps in  the interior valleys of California, and concludes with her release.  She  does a great job documenting daily life in the camps, like the ways the  prisoners created a community by organizing school for their children,  publishing a camp newspaper, staging performances, etc.  Perhaps the most  unusual aspect of Okubo's book is her lack of anger and bitterness.  One  would think forced relocation would spawn a lot of anger, but she  emphasizes positive aspects of life at the camps, and even expresses some  wistfulness about leaving upon her release.  I'm not sure how we should  read that--is it the genuine response of a young, resilient woman who was  able to see the whole experience as an adventure?  Her attempt to dignify  the prisoners by emphasizing how well they made the most of the oppressive  conditions?  Or, seeing that the book was first published in 1946, a  conscious effort not to voice more outrage than mainstream America was  willing to tolerate from a Japanese-American woman so soon after our war  with Japan?  I wish I knew.  In any case, Citizen 13660 is a very important  document, which deserves a place next to other illustrated accounts of  prisoner camps like Art Spiegelman's _Maus_ and _The Book of Alfred  Kantor_
