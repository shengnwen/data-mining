I found this book very informational and helpful in dealing with my family member who has a borderline personality disorder. I learned a lot about the illness and how to deal with both my feelings and thiers without being the bad guy all the time. They are now reading the book and learning about the disorder and how to deal with the feelings as they come up. I would recommend this book for anyone that has a relationship with a borderline personality disorder person
