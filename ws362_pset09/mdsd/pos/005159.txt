While I would never, ever, ever recommend this book for girls under tge age of 9 or so, I feel this is an appropriate book for girls ages 10-16.

Yes the book talks about things that may make a parent squeamish, but the book is there so your child gets the information you may not want to come out and say because you are uncomfortable with it.

At times the book is a bit more detailed than I prefer, such as the description of foreplay, however the book is never suggestive or graphic.  The information is quite accurate and presented in a mature and gentle fashion.  

This book is everything I wish I had known as a preteen and teen that my mother didn't share with me, instead I learned falsehoods from my friends at school. I am much more open and upfront with my daughters but I know there are things they want to ask about but don't know how to ask.  It is for those things that I am glad this book is available
