I have been a fan of Red Skelton since a child watching him on the black  &amp; white TV.  So when I had the opportunity to read this book, I jumped  at it.  Maybe I'm to big a fan and had Mr Skelton on a pedistal and was a  little shocked by the content of this book.  It was often hard for me to  read some chapters.  He was human and had frailities like all men.  The  book gave a great deal of detail to his struggling years, both  professionaly and personally.  There are many quotes from coworkers that  show a different, behind-the-scenes Red Skelton.  This man among clowns had  a life quite different for what the public saw through televison.  I'm just  glad he surrived and became a master comedian
