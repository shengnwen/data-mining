Given that the text in the book description field comes from the back of the book, I wasn't looking for something deep that would wring new depths of emotion from my tattered soul. The book was predictable, based on the back copy, and it was exactly what I was looking for. I enjoyed the character development, cared about what happened to them, and even knowing that things would have to turn out ok, I found myself crying over some of Megan's problems. I enjoyed Sutter's elderly aunt, who "seemed to have a great deal of trouble keeping things straight sometimes", but who cares about Sutter, and wants what she believes is best for him. I enjoyed the canine characters, and especially one of Megan's more exotic patients.

My only problem, and it's not uncommon for me, is that I'd really like to see some of the "happily ever after". Trouble is, there wouldn't be much plot at all. Maybe Fox could develop one or both of the supporting characters and I could peek in on how things are working out here while I enjoyed a new plot line.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the predictablility. I don't know why that should bother me, when it's just what I wanted. I suppose I'm just unreasonable
