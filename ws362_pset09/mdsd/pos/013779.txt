I must be in a masochistic mood, since this is the second book that I've recently read that has to do with probability and statistics, neither of which are my strong points.  I was drawn to the book by its seductive cover (for me, don't ask) and by the promises on the jacket.  Having recently read books about tough subjects - Freakonimics (about, economics); and Stumbling on Happiness (psychology- the tough to understand kind)- tailored for non-experts, I expected a layperson's ramble throught the thicket of probability.  Not so.

In contrast to these other works, the language initially seemed pretentious and sometimes impenetrable.  As I read on, however, I upped my reading gears to the level of the authors, and was able to better enjoy and somewhat better understand the propositions.  Of particular interest are the historical and biorgaphical coverage of the birth and development of various concepts.  Nevertheless, for me at least, I am probably (hee, hee) better off starting with a "For Dummies" treatment of the subject.
