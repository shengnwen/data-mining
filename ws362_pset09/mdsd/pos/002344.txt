Rophie presents some difficult new ideas in this book.  Although she is severly conservative and sometimes too stubborn to stop ranting, this book supports women.  Rophie encourages women to take control of their sexuality and be responsible for it.  Ultimately, this book is about the "double standard" sexually active women face (even in their own minds)
