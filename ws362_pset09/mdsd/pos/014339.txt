This book was recommended for me to read by my Sociology Professor instead of John Gray's work, Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus, and I love it!  I've delved a little into both texts and enjoy Gottman's work better since its suggestions are backed by years of clinical research on how  thousands of couples communicate and presents the strategies that worked  best for them, where Gray's are more based on observations.  This book  gives practical step by step knowledge of how to communicate with your  partner and the little snags that you run into day by day without even  knowing it.  I consider my partner and I very open and able to communicate  with each other, but reading this book showed us that even we could use  some improvement; it has helped me to see where my ability to communicate  goes astray and gave me ways to work on them.  The language is easy to  understand and there are even practice exercises you can do with your  significant other to review the information he presents.  The book presents  a whole program that you can do to help you communicate better with your  mate or even anyone you come into contact with.  If you are the kind of  person who constantly is searching to improve your life, then this is a  book for you
