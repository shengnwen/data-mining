This book would be a good "first" book to have on the subject of organizing and home management, but it might be a little light if you've read a few and are more than a novice.

Even though I don't like to visualize what this space would be like and other "pie-in-the-sky" planning, I found that when I actually answered those questions and determined what would be ideal, it's easier to get there and maintain it.

I really like organizing and home management books and I've written some reviews and comparisons of these kinds of books on my website:  www.momsplaceonline.com

This book is good for the money and it has some good ideas, even if it's not the best on the market.  It's all a learning process.
