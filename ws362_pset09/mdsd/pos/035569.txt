This is a great little book if you're a new goth, an elder goth, or someone curious about the subculture (a parent, friend, or outside observer).  But a sense of humor is imperative, or you will be offended.  This books shows that not all goths take themselves THAT seriously, we just pretend we do.  It's all a facade!  I really like the "anatomy" of different types of goths, I wish there had been more than Romantigoth, Deathrocker, CyberGoth and Rivethead.  But I'll take what I can get.  Voltaire's humor can be very droll and witty at the same time, and I was laughing out loud in places.  A very entertaining and educating book
