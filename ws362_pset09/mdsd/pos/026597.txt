This great mind tries to explain to us laymen the principles of space and time, and he does it quite well.  There are of course theories intermingled in amongst the hard science.  It is so easily read and understandable that it is a joy to read.   Black holes and quarks I find to be especially fascinating.  This book is a good starter for understanding the particle science, the universe and the unknown.

Wish you well
