I was so happy to read about feelings and experiences from this couple who are also having problems with their own teens.  Even though they are experts at counceling other people with problems as therapists, when they started having trouble with their own kids and the &quot;shoe was on the other foot&quot; they could see that they needed a SOLUTION.  As therapists they'd tried to find for other families, the root of the childs problem.  After having their own teens become unruly, they are honest in saying that they needed a SOLUTION, not to find blame or the root of the problem. It has helped me to stop blaming myself and my husband for my kids bad behavior.  That in itself has given me more strength to deal with the kids when they manipulate us. I got a lot out of their book.  I feel like I'm not alone with this problem.  And it gave me a whole new outlook on how to deal with the problem.  The only thing that dissapoints me is that there is not a toughlove group in my state.  And that is what is so stressed in the book, to get support from the group when you are using toughlove.  Even so, I am very happy I found the book to read.  If you are having problems with your teen, you should read it.  I only wish I'd read it a couple years earlier
