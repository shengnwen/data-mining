Seeing that this paint book is for children, it's the little one's opinion that counts. My daughter was so excited to begin painting, and she loved it! When you first look at the paint colors, they seem dark, but once she added a little water with the brush, they were perfect! The pink was just the right shade for Stephanie's hair and clothes, as well as the aqua-blue for Sportacus. The other reviewer said her paints were cracked - well, ours weren't, just a little creased which it normal. Anyway, a little water on the brush blends the paint back, so it was fine. The pages are porforated so you can remove before they paint if you'd like, and the story is very cute. The only thing is that the paint runs out quickly, but I'm sure that most households with children have plenty of paint on suppy. I recommend this paint book to all your little Lazytown fans out there.
