What a fascinating book!  While Westerners of today often imagine the Middle East as a place where women are oppressed, European ladies of the 18th to early 20th century went there for freedom from the restrictive Western culture.  The book quickly acknowledges that many of these women saw only what they expected to see in the land of Arabian Nights.  Most of these women would have been deemed Orientalists by Edward Said.  Nevertheless, their journals provide an interesting perspective on European as well as North African/Middle Eastern culture.  

Many of these women were early feminists, cross-dressing as men to gain freedom, exploring where few other Westerners, let alone women, had before.  This book paints a fascinating picture of these early female travellers to one of the most interesting areas of the world
