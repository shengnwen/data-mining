This book is an excellent resource for group facilitation -- it's been invaluable to me in the groups I work with.  There is a wealth of information on group dynamics, dealing with conflict, structure and group agreements, interspersed with Middle Eastern myth and some beautiful poetry.  As you might expect, Starhawk has included many exercises and questions to work through with your group -- helping you build the kind of group that will be nourishing and effective.  This is a book I find in the library of many successful priestesses -- it makes a great companion to Amber K's &quot;Covencraft&quot; and Judy Harrow's &quot;Wicca Covens.&quot;  Still, if I had to have only one of the three, it would be this book, hands down
