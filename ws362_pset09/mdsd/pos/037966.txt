I have been having mysterious health problems for over 3 years.  My symptoms included debilitating fatigue, low body temperature, the inability to concentrate, brain fog, heart palpatations, cluster headaches, mood swings, and unexplained weight gain. I even gained weight while dieting.   To make an incredibly long story short, this book changed my life.  By  reading this book, I discovered my problems were due to IgG food allergies.   I was so grateful to find that I wasn't alone and that there was a name  for my condition.  With further testing by ALCAT Labs, I avoided the foods  I had intolerances to.  In a short time I began feeling better and the  weight began to drop off.  Since then I have taken this a step further and  have had NAET treatments,,, and have permanently eliminated my  food sensitivities.I recommend this book to anyone with the inability to  lose weight, abdominal bloating, and any unexplained illness.  The small  cost is certainly worth the chance that this book will do for you what it  has for me.In my case this knowledge was the beginning of a second chance  at life
