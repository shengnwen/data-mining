A well written story about the first centuries of Christianity. The author is both a sociologist and an apologist of Christianity (a rare mixture). To me, among the minuses of the book was its obsession with quantitative stuff (the fact is, we have few reliable statistics about the Roman Empire, so does it make sense to try to get the r-statistic for a number of things?). The book is much more interesting when it tries to narrate how was that a very small, marginal sect by the late first century, turned out to be one of the world's major religions just 200 years later. Among the interesting stuff is how plagues cemented the rise of Christendom (pagans fled the crowded cities, while christians, who did not fear death, remained to attend the sick, rising the faith's reputation), the position of women in the christian movement (much more exalted than it was usually thought), the class basis of early christianity (not at all the province of the poorest men of the Roman Empire, according to Stark), the fearlessness of the christian martyrs, how hellenized jews were the bulk of converts to Christianity in its first centuries, in contrast with what is usually thought, etc
