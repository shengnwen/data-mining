It's easy to forget sometimes, based on the flair and panache he exudes on the television screen, just how educated Christopher Hitchens actually is.  In this book, you'll be treated to a lifetime's worth of insight and scholarship as he provides the reader with some of the best citations you'll ever come across, including, "Here I stand I can do no other" by Martin Luther.  

Hitchens is a contrarian but these Letters will appeal to anyone as they are the celebration of the mind via reason. When he first heard "the personal is political," he knew it was poison and he rails against the emotional approach to deciding issues in these pages.  I am very glad he did.  I couldn't help but think what I've thought about him so many times, "This is such a brave man."  

Regardless of what one believes regarding his arguments and positions, the author always puts forth sound rationale for why he thinks the way he does.  His critique of conformists is absolutely precious and I would be only too happy to give this book to any young person.  It's an education in itself
