This book does not get enough credit.  It is amazing, unforgettable, truthful, and, at sometimes, vulgar.  But, although some scenes are vulgar, they all make sense and lead to other scenes that are each so empowering!  The book contains no dialogue, but the description is so strong.  Honestly, this book is one of the best I have ever read.  The story is strong and Kosinski so brilliantly portrays the life of a Jew during the Holocaust.  This is a must read, and should be regarded as a classic
