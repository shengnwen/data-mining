In this seminal work Lewis identifies what he calls "men without chests" -- or human beings divorced from the Tao, the collected moral and philisophical wisdom of humanity.  Partly religious, partly practical, the Tao confronts the individual with a collective wisdom and a way that guides...  

In a modern world where technology now messes with genetic pre-dispositions, created human beings will not be in many senses human beings.  If vices are eliminable, diseases conquerable, pain controllable, will this radical disruption in the incentive systems of humanity change what it means to be human?  And is modern thinking -- already accomplishing a divorce from the traditional wisdoms -- going to complete the project of creating a new man?

Written in a manner that will engage, this short book captures the fears of many, atheist or theist, believer in humanism or God, that some central irreducible element of what it means to be human is now in play, at risk, fungible, and controllable, by technologies or even what Simmel called the modern defining categorical view of living -- the decision to forgo categorization.  The will to ignore the Tao, to find work arounds, to locate a new human software, now colors who we will allow our children to be.

As a corrective to the fans of the concept of a Singularity, there could not be a better book.  As we change man, we create men without chests, and wander afar into the world of unintended consequences.
