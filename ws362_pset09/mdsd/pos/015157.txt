This collection of Crane's work is a poetry lover's dream.  Without going into a critical analysis, (an excellent example is included in the  forward of the book) I found his work engaging both intellectually and emotionally.   Perhaps one of the most human and honest of poets, from his early work to  his last poem, &quot;The Broken Tower&quot;, his imagery is consistently  refreshing, stimulating and, ultimately, very moving.  Of particualr note  are the lesser known poems of his youth.  They are perhaps the most  accessible to readers unaccustomed to poetry of this depth and density.   &quot;The Hive&quot; is a wonderful expression of his own struggle as an  artist.  Also, the series &quot;Voyages&quot;, written about his love  affair with Emil Opffer, is a beautifully rendered poem using the power of  the sea as a metaphor for their love.  For readers familiar with the first  edition, I found the new introduction a bit too dry and analytical.  The  original intro told more of Crane's life and the human struggles he went  through and explained more about his suicide.  I found that to be an  invaluable guide to understanding much of what he expresses in the poetry.   The new hardbound edition is beautifully layed out and gives justice to the  sensitive work within it
