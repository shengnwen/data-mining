First, let's ignore the oxymoron of the "ultimate" guide's fourth edition - if that first edition was so "ultimate," how come three (so far) came after?

The format is straightforward: two or four pages per winery, with glorious photos of the vineyards, buildings, or other distinguishing features of each winery. The tourist's basics are spelled out on the first of that winery's pages: address and contact information  hours of operation, tour arrangements, typical offerings in the tasting room, and tasting fees. A brief, enthusiastic description follows, often with a sound bite or two from the owners.

It's a great help in planning your wine country vacation, or reminder of the good times you had in the Napa valley. Don't expect serious criticism or comparison of the wines - that's for a different book. Do check the information presented, since it's been at least three years (as of this writing) since the most recent edition came out. But dig in and enjoy, since that's what wine and travel are all about.
