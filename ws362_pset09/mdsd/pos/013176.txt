Women have become so polarized in the past 30-40 years that we are our own worst enemies. Some women have had to work in every generation to support their families and some women hire other people to raise their children so they can play golf and have their hair done. FINE! Perhaps if women stopped being so critical of choices made by others, we could find more constructive ways to help children to grow up in loving and attentive environments. 

On a personal note, I left my career to raise my two daughters and have never regretted a moment. They are wonderful, funny, competent women and they are looking forward to being parents. Parenting is the most difficult job in the world - no pay, no sleep, every penny goes to them and no vacations. (Holidays are working days for moms.) So much work, so little time. Best job in the world
