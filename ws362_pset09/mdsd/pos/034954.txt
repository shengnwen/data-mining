Throughout Cortesans Hickman makes it clear that she is not only facinated by her subjects, but is deeply invested in making sure the reader end the book with the same admiration for them that she has. She fails. Hickman repeated lauds the five prositutes whose stories she recounts as &quot;independant&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot;, but it becomes painfully obvious to the reader that Hickman has an agenda, she's determined to paint these women as proto-feminists, as opposed to the opportunists they were. Despite their &quot;independance&quot;, these women were solely dependand on the fortunes of thier male protectors for money and not one made sound personal or financial decisions. Despite their &quot;power&quot; these women were almost all entirely at the mercy of fashion, thier careers ended aburptly as the women themselves went out of fashion. Elizabeth Armitage was the exception, and her story is particuarily intersting. An interesting read all the same, but too little academics and too much opinion for my taste
