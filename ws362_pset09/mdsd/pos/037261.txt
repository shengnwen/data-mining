And this is why God has created a special place for his homebodies to keep "half heart on earth and half in heaven".
God has created a place for his homebodies called The Heavenly Village.  God's homebodies are second-guessing themselves about going straight to heaven.  His homebodies didn't finish their story on earth.  This comforting and well-written story by Cynthia Rylant has a great moral -enjoy things while you have them and to live life fully.

Cynthia Rylant has a way of writing in this book that you have such a great picture in your mind when you read this fictional story you get a comfortable feeling that everything is going to be ok.  Cynthia Rylant has also written Missing May and The Blue Hill Meadows.

I recommend this book to mostly girls, although some boys might like this. I recommend this when you are younger than eleven.
