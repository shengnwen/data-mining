I could not put this book down! It was easy to read and informative. I had an analysis done and sure enough, I have a copper overload. Finally I know why I am tired all the time. This book is a must read! I plan to give a  couple of these books as gifts. This seems to be a major problem and people  don't even know it. Doctor's should read this book, it may help their  patients. Being tired all the time is not all in our heads....
