Okay I watched the movie Sahara, based on the Clive Cussler, Dirk Pitt novel.  Movie wasn't all that great, but I figured the book must be good if they were willing to make a movie about the character.

Well I started at the begining of the Dirk Pitt adventure series and I haven't been dissappointed.  They just keep getting better.

Vixen 03 is the fifth book in the series.  Once again we find our NUMA special projects leader diving in over his head.  From a South African civil war brewing, to a plague capable of wiping out entire civilizations, and an attack on the nation's capital this book keeps you rocketing foward.  Pitt's Sherlock Holmes mind, his way with the ladies, and his overwhelming desire to solve any problem he is faced with gives you a real page turner character.  Fans of his side-kick Giordino will once again enjoy his unwaivering loyalty and his quick one-liners
