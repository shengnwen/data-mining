I am a student of Medieval history, and I understand that some people feel the need to make everything historical authentic to within an inch of its life.  But, I believe that this is one of those novels that is excellent, despite a few anachronisms.  Just shut off the part of your brain that says, "That's not what such-and-such wrote in his annals about rural life," and enjoy a good story with a very strong Medieval feel.
  
Every time has had people who live a day-to-day mundane life without respite.  Try reading women's letters from the Victorian era if you think Marion's life is boring.  
Not everyone had fairs, markets, pilgrims, and visitors.  Even today, you are lucky if you find someone in my home town with cable TV.  There will always be communities that are isolated, or even just a bit more out of touch than others.

Just stop over-analyzing and read the book
