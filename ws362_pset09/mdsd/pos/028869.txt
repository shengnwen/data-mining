Yes this book may be dated and has non-vegetarian recipes included but that does not exclude it from a good vegetarian cookbook library.  I have some of the biggies of the cookbook genre and with internet access so easy I rarely use any cookbooks at all.  However this cookbook is the mainstay of my library for a few reasons.  One it lists vegetable chapters alphabetically and if one is not listed it is easy to locate in the index.  Two before the formal recipes are given for say carrots it tells you all about carrots and gives a number of quick ideas and methods for using carrots that involves 1 or two steps only.  Three and I could go on, the recipes go from basic, to country, to sophisticated and everywhere inbetween with substitutions often suggested.  If I had to keep one cookbook, besides the one I bake with, I would keep this one
