Just a great story by one of the old guys. You know, at the risk of blaspheming, there are other programs out there. Not for me. But others may have had successes in the attempts to moderate and live with this disease. Bill Wilson and Bob Smith couldn't, thank God, and we are here today to listen to the founding people, and their experience, strength and hope. 

AAers get criticized by those who feel it's too religious. Too cultish. That we're all automatons. Did you ever hear someone who has had consecutive years of sobriety say those things? "Well my whole life has changed, I have less but I have more. My wife trusts me. I haven't missed a day of work in thirteen years. My daughters-in-law let me take my grand kids out for the day. But the AA Program is just too damn cultish!" 

"We think not."

Great stuff by an old guy. These are transcriptions of conversations so they're not necessarily seamless. But all in all, great life-saving stuff. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur
