Fans of the previous volumes of this series should enjoy this one, also.  However, there were a few things about it that bothered me, just a tiny bit.  They have a new translator this time, who translates things differently, so characters have different speech patterns than they had in previous volumes.  Also, a bit too much of the book is taken up by magical battles for my taste.  Although the fights are well done, I would have preferred more comedy than we get this time around.  But, that's just me.  Other fans of the series may feel differently
