Christine is one of those Stephen King novels that you shake your head at after you finish the last page.  There's a bad taste left in your mouth that may be a little hard to identify.  What is it?  Mediocrity?  Perhaps.  Maybe it's just the realization that your hero has just flubbed a little and shown that he is human after all.  Is Christine Stephen King's best work.  Definitely not.  Is it his worst?  Far from it.  This is the first stumbling point in his long and illustrious career.  Nestled in between Different Seasons and Pet Sematary, Christine fails in a few areas.  Superbly written, the characters are just flat and a little too cliche.  

Arnie Cunningham, high school geek extraordinaire, falls in love with the beastly old wreck of a Plymouth Fury affectionately named Christine by her former owner and the wheels start spinning.  Tortured and tormented by the usual band of high school bullies, Arnie begins to obsess upon the car to the point where his best friend Dennis (the football hero and unlikely yin to Arnie's geek-reeking yang) starts to have some serious doubts about Arnie's state of sanity. Enter Leigh, the hottest new chick in school, and suddenly Arnie is dating her.  Whoa!  Must be the car.  But Christine is a jealous girl and she deals in revenge.

Edgy and cool in places and downright annoying in others, Christine is choppy.  Written in thrid and then first person, this seemed like experimental King.  I couldn't give a sh*t about the characters and that's not a good sign.  Like I said.  King's best?  Far from it. King's worst?  Far from it.  This is middle-of-the-road Stephen King.  Definitely worth a read or two, but that's about all the attention Chrinstine needs to garner.

Dig it!
