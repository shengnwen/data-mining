I bought this book because I was always facinated by Sharon Osbourne. she is a truley exceptional woman. I relate to her in so may ways. This book far exceeded my expectations. It is a great read and very amusing at times. If a great read is what your craving and a little pick me up is in order for your life then you will definately want to add this book to your collection. She is an inspiration to every woman who has a dream of being successful without putting up with other people's crap. She is truely an inspiration. She takes the reader into a personal part of herself that not may people see. Sharon Osbourne is brave enough to tell of her own harsh life experiences without feeling sorry for herself and putting a little spin of humor to it. GREAT READ!!!
