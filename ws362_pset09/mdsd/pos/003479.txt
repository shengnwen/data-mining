I highley recommend this book to anyone.  It's written very well and  clearly.  It has given me some great ideas on how to market myself and  projects I have in the works. Plus the added interest on how other famous  and not so famous people came up with imaginative ideas like (Mischief  Marketing). Anyone interested in creative ways to market should buy this  book.  5 star rating.  I'm very pleased with this book and I'm glad I  bought it.  Thanks for taking the time to read this
