This book gives you the latest update on what's going on in real options theory. Brilliant throughout, but its really too hard mathematically to be of much value for someone who's not a math-person. I found the chapter on  the Antamina mine to be immensely interesting. It was originally used as a  case study on options theory at Harvard and shows you how these academics  went about valuing a peruvian mine. It's a very valuable chapter because it  is focused on the practical side of real options theory. The chapter on  &quot;Rules of thumb for capital budgeting&quot; didn't make much sense at  all to me. The rest of the chapters are no easy read, but if you feel up to  it mathematically, you're going to find this a very interesting book. If  your not that much into mathematics, I think it's going to leave you rather  frustrated. This book cannot have been meant as a guide for practitioners,  it's more of a field day for academics, that's my impression at least
