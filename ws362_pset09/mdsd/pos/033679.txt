  The Spiral of Memory and Belonging is a good book but it is not a great book by any means.  I was at first riveted and then the fire died down as the author plunged into fluff and repetition without going anywhere.  Then the book redeemed itself at the discussion of the three spirals.  I was slightly taken aback at the description of the downward spiral.  I believe there are many reasons why someone could head downward.  The threshold and upward spiral were also useful.  I found the section on healing family/ancestral wounds also pertinent.  Although I wanted more.  I think the author has experienced much more and has a LOT to offer but this book only hints at it.  Definitely worthwhile reading for anyone new to shamantic practise but it is still vague and full of fluff for those familiar with these experiences.
