This is a fabulous addition to the Endurance myth.  In the last several years Shackleton has gone through a bit of a revival with a big movie and release of several books.  This biography of the man himself is a must read for anybody looking to get at the reasons for why a man would trek out into the dark, lonely, uncharted waters of the Antarctic.  Perhaps the vougue comes to us as we look around to find our own uncharted lands and discover we have very little of it left.  This is a life that literally could not be led in todays world of Global Positioning and Gortex.  It brings to mind the question of the next great frontiers, the mind, space or underseas adventure all could be next.  To match Shackleton one would have to build the rocket ship themselves out of duct tape and soda cans and somehow save his crew from aliens in the meantime.  All the while Shackleton never really lets on that the true mission is to become a hero at any cost.  Truly inspirational
