I am an avid history reader and in general I found this book excellent. I am troubled by the fact that this book covers the period from 950 to 1350 and the author repeatedly refers to corn as a crop. My understanding is that corn came from America and therefore could not be introduced in Europe until the 16th century. Is not the author in error or am I missing something
