Mary Anne is such a crybaby. I mean, she's 13 and hasn't grown out of crying IN PUBLIC. She's scared when Dawn pulls this dopey prank on her, and she's so spoiled! In the chapter when she and Richard move to Dawn's, MA crys over little things like cleaning supplise, not to metion is way overprotective of Tiger! Of course the movers wouldn't drop a chair on him! Furthermore, MA blames everything on Dawn. I agree with Dawn - Mary Anne is the wicked stepsister of Stoneybrook! 

I gave this book 5 stars, however, for Dawn. She tried her hardest to put up with her wicked stepsister and played an incredible prank on MA. Way to go, Dawn!
