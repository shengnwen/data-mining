Even though this book was written in the mid-90s, it remains as gripping and timely as ever.  I just got around to reading it due to a recent interest in public health and epidemiology.  It is truly an enthralling story that grabs hold of you and keeps you turning pages long after you should have gone to bed or started your chores.

In addition to telling the absorbing, true story of the discovery of the nature of the "thread" viruses (primarily Ebola and Marburg) the book offers some intriguing tidbits about the African environment where these viruses and the HIV virus first arose.  For instance, Richard Preston talks about a cave on Mount Elgon in East Africa called Kitum, which may be the original site of the Marburg virus.  After outlining the various ways that Marburg might live in the cave within a host creature, Preston tells readers of a fascinating theory about the creation of Kitum Cave.  It seems that elephants may have carved the cave out of solid rock over the millennia in their attempts to find salts and other minerals.  The elephants chip away at the cave walls with their tusks and then chew up pieces of rock to get the minerals they crave.  This type of "bonus" anecdote makes reading the Hot Zone even more interesting that it would be otherwise, which is really saying something, as this is one of the most captivating books I've read in a long time.

One last point:  The fact that this story is true and that it includes a good deal about the science of public health and virus hunting shows that really great writers like Preston can and do produce intelligent books that are also page-turners
