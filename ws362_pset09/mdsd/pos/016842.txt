The Dark Tower Boxed Set (Books 1-4) are the first books of seven that comprise the Dark Tower epic. Stephen King wrote the seven books over a period of 33 years, the last three written 2000-2003. I'm a big Stephen King fan and have read about 80% of his work. These four books are on a par in excellence of all of King's works. I'm looking forward to reading the last three books of the seven! The entire seven volumes consist of 4,555 pages
