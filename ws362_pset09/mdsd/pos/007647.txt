A former university professor attempts to secure British coal for his government, which is enmeshed in civil war.  He must contend with both the enemy and untrustworthy agents on his own side.  Graham Greene presents an unlikely, introspective hero who pursues his goal doggedly out of duty rather than passionate ideology.  Shell-shocked and traumatized by his war experiences, his emotions and sense of outrage gradually begin to stir as he witnesses the human cost of his own mission.
