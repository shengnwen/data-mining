Blackjack For Blood is the best book on blackjack I have ever read -- and I have read just about all of them. According to all the experts, Carlson's Advanced Omega II System (included in the book) is much stronger than Hi-Lo or K-O, and I have found it surprisingly easy to master. It definitely gets the money; that's for sure. I also like the author's writing style. He explains things very well, and he intersperses the hardcore stuff with entertaining stories about his high-rolling experiences in various casinos around the world.  All in all, a terrific book on how to beat casino blackjack.  I highly recommend it
