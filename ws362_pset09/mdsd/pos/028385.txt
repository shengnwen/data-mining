I visited the Comfort Diner when I was visiting NY recently and really enjoyed the pancakes and vanilla shake (best ever). We have only tried the pancake and french toast recipes in this book but they were both great. The snippets of info along the way are interesting and so are some of the twists in the recipes. I have bought 3 more copies as gifts.
