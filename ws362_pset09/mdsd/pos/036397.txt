This edited volume brings together some of the central studies in the field of conversation analysis.     Chapters in the various sections address such foundational topics as: Methodology; 'Preference organization'; Topic organization; non-vocal interaction; &amp; 'aspects of responses to other's talk'.     The chapters are written by scientists who are leaders in this field of research (e.g., Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson, Pomertantz, Drew, Goodwin, Heritage, Atkinson, Button, etc.).     This collection also includes two classic lectures by Harvey Sacks: one on 'methodology' of conversation analysis; the other a brilliant analysis on the ways in which one's viewing, experiencing, and subsequent reporting of events has 'built into it' the task of presenting one's self as a reliable, reasonable viewer of more or less typical events in the world.     This book is an *essential* volume for anyone doing research on (or interested in) how human interaction is structured
