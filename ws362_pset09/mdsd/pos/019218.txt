. . . and comes out shining.  This is a fine introduction for the mathematically uninitiated. The fact of the matter is that these are the HARDEST seven problems out there--problems so hard that a graduate-level education in mathematics is typically needed to even begin attempting to solve these problems. As someone who's been in college sinfully long, and had some college calculus, I can say that the math required to understand these problems is way beyond that of the average college graduate.  That said, Devlin's genius is that he boils the math down into basic functions that are more or less easily understood.  He also places the problems in their proper historical context (discusses their etiology) and he also looks at some of the ways that the problems have been approached in the past.  I didn't expect to like this book; I was pleasantly suprised.
