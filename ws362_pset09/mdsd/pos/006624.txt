Allen Wyler has written the kind of story that changes the way people think. At least THIS person will never look at a hospital the same again. It's scary enough to go under the knife, to let let someone gas you to sleep, to trust the people in charge of your well being... now, we find out there are a thousand other glitches that can arm well meaning staff and docs with inaccurate information about you.

Little turns of phrase and observations change simply reading about hospital environments into experiencing them. I learned a lot--good and bad, actually--about physicians, hospitals, medical procedures from this truly gripping book. Can't wait for the next one
