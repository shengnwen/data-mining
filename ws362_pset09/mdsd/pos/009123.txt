Please, remember this is my first review.

This book is a succinct view of humanism as a philosophy of life.  In reality, humanism is extremely diverse and encompasses a vast array of ideas and opinions and so this book may in some ways seem foreign or even arrogant at times.  However, I found that at the core of this work it was extremely well thought out, providing both the philosophical truths of the past, and the humanist counterpoints.
If you're interested in humanism, and what that basic philosophy entails then this is the best book with which to start.  Or, if you're looking for a summation of humanism then this is also a great book.
However, if you're looking to be a humanist, this is a good place to begin and a terrible place to end.
That last comment should not take away from the overall quality of the work, and of Corliss Lamont's supreme scholarship
