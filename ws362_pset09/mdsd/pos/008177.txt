Chuck Pfarrer does an amazing job in telling his story (which he was apparently reluctant to write).  I had a hard time putting it down and would get down right nasty with my officers when they would call me with radio traffic.  I have read numerous books in the military genre and have to say that Chuck's story is without a doubt the best self told story I have ever read.  He brings you into his world with amazing clarity, making you feel like you are sitting on the plane getting read for the jump or hunkered down in a bunker eating mre's while Wally shoots around you.  His honesty about his feelings for what happened in Beirut and afterwards reminds us how much the men (and woman) of our military go through while we are allowed to sit at home in relative comfort and watch from our t.v.'s as events unfold.  Thank you Lt. Pfarrer for taking the time to share with us your story.
