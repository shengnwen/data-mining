I've read the first two Repairman Jack novels and enjoyed the first a great deal, the second somewhat less. This one, however, is by far the best of the series, and is almost worthy of the best of H.P. Lovecraft. Best of all, it is open-ended. This is is some pretty creepy stuff; horror, really, with a touch of science fiction. The SF is irrelevant; Wilson should have made the book srraight horror. And horror it is, being a contest between Evil and, well, not necessarily Good, but something that wants to keep Evil off of its turf. A tiny part of that turf is the Earth and the human race. Scary stuff, that just might keep you from going to sleep...unless you leave the lights on
