We spent a week on Maui and covered most of the island by car.  We used this map religiously and had it with us constantly.  It is up to date and we didn't find any errors.  The blow-up sections for the individual towns were very helpful too.  It's a fabulous island and there's lots to see and do.  This map will help you get around to see it all
