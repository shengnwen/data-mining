I've purchased several copies of this book and read it several times. It has also been required reading for my Shotokan karate students for years.  The insights of Nicol of his experiences in Japan, training under karate  legends Masatoshi Nakayama Sensei and Hirokazu Kanazawa Sensei, are  priceless.  What an absolute shame this classic work is now out of print
