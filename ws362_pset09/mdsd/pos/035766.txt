The feisty Father, the parasol-loving Mother, affectionate doctor Nefret and phlegmatic Ramses.  A well written novel of historical mystery and romance.  I wouldn't say it's a thriller, since the the romance part is the majority of the story.

Set in Egypt during the height of World War I, a husband-and-wife + son-and-daughter-in-law Egyptologists adventures were told in a very interesting way.  Being my first Elizabeth Peter's Amelia Peabody adventure, I found this lady writer has developed a romance story, while enveloping it with history and adventure quite well.  There are many mundane daily things which are missed in current thriller novels which were not skipped by the author.  Which, by themselves are quite interesting since the reader can try to relate how people during the early 1900s era might lived their lives.

Though it was written quite excellently, I did not find the edge of plot too convincing.  The author left the end dangling, which is what she had in mind to prolonged these series.  The culprit in this novel, Jamil, was nowhere to be found.  Waiting for the next novel to pick up the saga.

Anyhow, an excellent read for anybody interested in romance, adventure and Egyptian hystory novels
