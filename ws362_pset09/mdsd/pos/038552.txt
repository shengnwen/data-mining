I have read all three of Mr. Savage's recent books, Savage Nation, The Enemy Within, and now this one. These books enrage the self-styled "trendy" leftist mainstream, because they are based on fact. The so-called tolerant left have resorted to anti-Semitic remarks, for lack of any rational criticsm for Mr. Savage. 
There was a time when I was younger, when I almost became a leftist. However, I am one of the few people who read and research both sides of an issue, where too many others simply rely on what they already think that they know. I attended meetings of leftist groups, I read their "literature", and all manner of publications.

Under the principle's of Western culture, we follow Voltaire's philosophy of "Although I hate what you say, I will fight to the death for your right to say it." Under a leftist "politically-correct" regime, you will find yourself in a concentration camp if you speak contrary to the leftist dogma. I am a military veteran of 15 years service, and a patriot
