A wonderful book on a fascinating subject.  Russian architecture is so varied, I really had no idea and this book is exhaustingly thorough.  I especially enjoyed the section on Imperial Russian Architecture and the later Soviet Architecture.  It is obvious how Speer influenced Soviet architecture, his Third Reich Berlin may have never been realized, but his spirit it is alive and well in Soviet buildings.  If you have any interest in Russia or architecture or just well researched, scholarly books, then i cant imagine you being disappointed
