Gosh, I hate the word DUMMIES. The information in this book is basic but is written in a bit of a condescending manner. The delivery is often simplistic, if not silly. (For example, they say my ovaries were dozing and asleep. That's why my period was late some months. Silly.) The Dummies book reminds me of how a mother might explain something to a little kid. (Gee, I hate that word Dummies.) I am sure it is a coincidence that two similar books came out the same month, but of the two, I much prefer The Menopause Survival Guide by Donna Rogers, which I purchased. In that book, the information is delivered like two adult women were sitting around talking about menopause, and one is explaining to the other what is actually going on in their bodies
