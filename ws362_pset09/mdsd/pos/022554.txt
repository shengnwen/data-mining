We liked &quot;Leadership When the Heat is On&quot; so much that we use it  as a resource for our corporate leadership in-house training.  Concise and  well-written, the author uses his own life experiences, as well as the  experiences of other great individuals, to aid the reader in reaching his  true potential.  &quot;Leadership When the Heat is On&quot; is full of  self-discovery and those &quot;aha&quot; moments where the reader gains  greater personal insight. The book is a primer for future leaders,  especially those in fast-paced or results oriented organizations.  Highly  recommended and a &quot;must read&quot; for future leaders and leaders  wishing to hone their motivational and leadership skills
