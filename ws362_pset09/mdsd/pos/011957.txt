This reviewer enjoyed this book. I can relate to Amy quite a bit. At times I would forget who was speaking and a bit confused, but I enjoyed the way it was written. Maybe the subject hits home for too many people, or maybe alcoholism is accepted in the world today, but this book had me from the beginning.

I felt the ending was a bit abrupt and wish it would have ended on a different note, but I hope to get other books from this author
