I bought this just for a laugh--I live in Japan, and I'm married to a Japanese woman. I never had much experience picking up Japanese girls, as my wife is the only one I ever dated, but over the years I've known a few gaijin guys here whose favorite activity is "picking up chicks." Most of them are English teachers (rarely with any real qualifications), and they often have little hesitation in dating their students. Much like the main character--who is possibly the author in this maybe-biographical novel.

Yes, it's not a guide to picking up chicks, though it pretends to be for the first few pages. Soon it turns into a picaresque novel, and we laugh at our hapless hero. And then it gets a little serious, but then it's lighthearted again...and then it slowly gets darker and darker, but you hardly notice as the author continues humorously to self-depricate his doppleganger. And then...wow. You realize it's not the book you thought AT ALL. It's something with a whole lot more oomph to it than you ever expected.

I won't go into more detail about that--I hate it when Amazon customer reviews reveal important plot information. I'll just say this is a damn good book, and Josh Muggins ought to be proud as hell of it
