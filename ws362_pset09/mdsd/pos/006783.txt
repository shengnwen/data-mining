James Patterson has done a number of overlapping novels around the theme of beautiful genetic hybrid children who fly.  His books are often page-turners that engage the reader almost against your will.  One is inclined to forgive the loose ends of plot development that he leaves lying around. However, the notion that a large group of renegade genetic manipulators could operate in secret and with impunity from law enforcement (not to mention investigative journalists!) as it kills off its opponents and conducts massive man-hunts for seven flying kids, is a little too much of a reach. 

Still worth the read, even if you don't buy the sequels.
