Had to read this book for an English Class. Quite interesting. About multicultural oppurtunities in the 1930's. Characters are well developed, story-line is slightly...boring?? Maybe boring isn't the word, but there is a lot of whoop-la for a mere lesson to be learned. Suggested book with an open-mind
