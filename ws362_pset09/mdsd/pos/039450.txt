Another great book by Susanka.  She has the ability to write in layman's terms so that you completely understand the concepts.  She has really good before and after illustrations in this book to show how various designs can enhance and beautify your remodeled space.  This book is helping me to better explain to the architect we are hiring what our design needs are
