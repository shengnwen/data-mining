The supplement industry moves at light speed at introducing new products, so the fact that this book is six years old is somewhat of a hindrance. However, that being said, it has a unique medical perspective on just about every vitamin, herb, and mineral you could think of. 

Each supplement included in the book includes short sections starting with "Basic Information" that shows foods that include the supplement, if any exist. Also there are sections on known effects (studied and proven), possible additional effects (proven via anecdotal evidence), warnings and precautions, and notes for those who are breastfeeding, infants and children, and senior citizens. There is also information on storage, safe dosage, toxicity, and adverse reactions. 

This book is written by an M.D., so it does seem a bit overly cautious at times, but in the age of the Internet with so many snake oil salesmen claiming they have the cure for everything from Alzheimer's to diabetes in a nutritional supplement, I find this voice of caution refreshing. I consider this book just one more weapon in my arsenal of nutritional knowledge. 

I also recommend the book "Prescription for Nutritional Healing". That book focuses on specific illnesses, while this book focuses on the herbal remedies and nutritional supplements mentioned in that book. They definitely make good companion reading.
