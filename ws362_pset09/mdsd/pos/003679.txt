This book was a fun, fast, and easy read.  True, it was a bit of a stretch to buy the contemporary, self-doubting protagonist as a goddess...but it was fun to read and made me giggle out loud.  If you're looking for a light, easy read and a likeable heroine, snatch this book up.  If you're looking for a complex story line and something deeply thought-provoking, well, there are other books out there...
