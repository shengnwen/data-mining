This book gives four informative, exciting, compelling accounts of the Titanic tragedy. The Lightholler report, being the only survivor amongst the senior officers &amp; quite liberally mentioned by the other authors,  is particularly interesting. The stoic response by the vast majority of  obviously doomed male passengers to the prospect of drowning in sub-zero  temperature water, as they stood orderly by, or assisted in the loading of  women &amp; children in the life-boats, is quite staggering. One of the  storytellers has a sad, old-fashioned tendency to describe many of the  non-English speaking survivors in very disparaging terms. Indeed, Gracie  quite often comes across as annoyingly pompous in his descriptions. On the  other hand the short report of the surviving wirelessman is totally  unstuffy &amp; hugely readable. The inquiries' treatment of Ismay, the  President of Titanic's Company &amp; a survivor against all the odds for  single males, is particularly interesting . The book also highlights some  of the movie's mistakes, especially the breaking off of the stern section  prior to sinking. On the whole a good book &amp; worth buying
