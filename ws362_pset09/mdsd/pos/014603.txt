A fascinating and exceptionally well written view into America in the late 19th century.  If you love either history or baseball then you should read.  If you love both then this book is made for you.  If you love neither but have interest, then I strongly reccommend because the author does a terrific job of making the characters and scenes come to life. I very much enjoyed this book
