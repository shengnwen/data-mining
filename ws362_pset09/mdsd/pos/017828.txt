Janet Angelillo scores a home run in this stellar teaching resource book that is bound to inspire teachers to discard old-fashioned methods of teaching punctuation (worksheets, skill and drill) in favor of those found in this book.  The text is filled with ideas for lessons that will motivate, challenge, and create independent writers who use punctuation--sophisticated punctuation--with ease.  Chocked full of ready-to-use mini-lessons that feature a variety of texts for students to examine, they learn how powerful punctuation can be in making the meaning of their writing clear.  Angelillo makes it possible for every teacher to put into practice what research and best practices has been saying for a long time:  We learn to write and use conventions in the context of real writing, not from worksheets.  And best of all, she doesn't just tell you, she shows you how.  This is an important book for every writing teacher to read and use with students of all ages
