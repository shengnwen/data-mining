I first read Dr. Moody's collection of near-death experiences in the mid-1980s when death was only an academic subject for a thiry-something person. I was fascinated by the accounts he and pediatrician Melvin Morse had collected from patients and felt a sense of reassurance that the compiler was a scientist. These reports changed my outlook on life. Now, about two decades later, it makes it easier to accept a most shattering loss, the passing of my partner and husband of 33 years. However, I'm more drawn now, not to the accounts of "tourists," who have gone and come back, but the permanent residents whom mediums like George Anderson have interviewed
