Ok this book is awesome. However, whenever I see an attractive girl, I no longer think "wow, she is gorgeous". Now I think "hmm, the only reason i think she has great legs, a nice booty and pretty face is because my genes are programed to like that." Although, I will admit that it is REALLY interesting to know why certain traits are considered attractive and how evolution shaped our idea of beauty. 

There were a few parts of this book that bored me though... there is a lot of bird talk. Not that birds are bad, I am just interested more in humans. But nontheless, this book is still fascinating, and I highly reccomend it... not that my reccomendation means anything to any of you, but still, its darn interesting book
