I love a book that forces a new perspective.  All too often we get into a rut with our books as far as the narrator is concerned.  Reading this book gives you a great insight into someone else's perspective, reasoning, and thought processes.  Certainly, many books are capable of evoking a sense of empathy for some random criminal or detective or whoever the story is being told by.  This one though gives you a good insight into the reasoning of those that too many of us just assume have little or no capacity for reason whatsoever . . . those that just babble and ramble on incessantly.  It's a quick, easy, and entertaining read
