Wow! I was intrigued by this book, becasue although I remember parts and bits on the news, this book brought it altoegther into a comprehnsive story. I thought it was quite revealing how much the USSR spent vs. what the United States spent for intelligence. Who got the biggest bang for their buck? Well you gotta read it. The American technological machine is incredible. It makes me wonder what if they directed all that super talent and brains to develop a means were the world can be more peaceful. My father was a submarine salior so it was particularly interesting for me to get another insight to the submarine force, espically the modern nuclear force
