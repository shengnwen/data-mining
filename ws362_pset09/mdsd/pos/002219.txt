I love this book! I have been using it for about 10 years and wanted the new edition. The author explains the energy-based philosophy of Eastern Nutrition in a clear, understandable way. I love the explanation of grains and their value, how to transition to a mostly vegetarian way of eating, fasting, juicing, and so much more
