NEVER CRY WOLF starts out as one more take on that old standby; the incompetence of the government. In this case, Canada and its rather confused manner of dealing with the problem of wolves "killing" caribou. Sending a lone naturalist out to investigate the problem without the mere suggestion of a plan and then losing him to the wilds, Mowat's tale starts as a farce, but as time goes on, the author shifts his focus to the true heart of the book, the life of a family of wolves and his eventual understanding of their place in the natural order. Working alongside local Inuits, he sees the wolves for what they are, not murderous predators, but feeling and affectionate animals. His research into  how the wolves actually survive in the winter is hilarious and insightful. The book does suffer a bit from the superior attitude the author adapts at times, but NEVER CRY WOLF is another example of informative and entertaining writing about an aspect of the natural world
