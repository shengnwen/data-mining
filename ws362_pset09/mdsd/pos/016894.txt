This book provides some interesting theories and some good beginning info about the various secret and not-so secret societies. However, it needs to show more clearly where some of the information is coming from. It's one thing to say, so and so was a mason or whatever, but where did this come from? How do you know? The flow is a little dis-jointed and scattered but it holds a reader's interest. It definelty gives some good background and will pique your curiosity to learn more. Coupled with some of Graham Hancock's stuff and you will come away with a really new perspective on history
