Please keep in mind that I really liked this book.  "Enchantress" is well written and enjoyable.  That being said, I could not entirely enjoy the story because I had a problem with the heroine.  I know this probably says more about me than her but...

The heroine, as thoughtful and insightful as she is, is a bit of a hypocrite.   She "suffers" enormously with guilt about even the smallest of lies she is forced to tell her "poor primitive" lover.

On the other hand she only feels a twinge of condescending pity for her fiancé whom she has been more-or-less betraying by concealing her "forbidden love" for the "primitive" for most the book.

And when it comes to lying to her father and sneaking around behind his back; forget about it!  She doesn't even hesitate a second and even takes a certain pleasure in it, even when, inevitably, her "disobedience" endangers entire civilizations.

There are only four main characters in this book.  The heroine, her male father, her male fiancé, and her male lover.  I found myself many times wishing she had a mother, sister, or best friend to whack her upside the head and tell her to stop acting so ridiculous.

The one woman who COULD and WOULD have set her straight was killed as the book opened.  (Actually there WAS one other female in the book; a practically-unconscious sacrifice victim being "delivered to the dragon.")  

Anyway enough about my problems.  If you didn't even notice the things I had issues with, (and you probably didn't) "Enchantress" is a good read.
