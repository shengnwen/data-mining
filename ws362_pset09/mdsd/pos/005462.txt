This wonderful little book takes one hundred questions, primarily pertaining to the film "The Passion Of The Christ," and gives solid and Biblically based answers to each.  A couple of the questions are more follow-up to previous questions that explain with a little more depth certain Catholic beliefs and teachings than outright explanations of happenings in the film.

The author is quick to note that some of the things happening in the film are portrayed with plenty of artistis license.  However, the freedoms taken by Mel Gibson in the film are meant to enhance the actual occurrence of the Passion.

If you are Catholic, this book is a wonderful guide that opens the door for further study, primarily thanks to the three appendices and the resource guide at the back of the book.  These appendices include the five Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary, the Stations of the Cross, and the Seven Last Words of Christ.  The resource guide includes recommended books on apologetics, Bible study, personal experiences, and, of course, the Passion.

If you aren't Catholic, you may be turned off by the "Catholic"-ness of the book.  That has to be taken into consideration, however, since Gibson based the movie on the events in the Bible, illustrated by the Stations of the Cross, and the personal writings of Venerable Anne Catherine Emmerich and Venerable Maria de Agreda.  Though some of the things mentioned in this book go against most Protestant beliefs, this Catholic has to say that at least we can agree that Jesus did die for our sins and our salvation.

Recommended to Catholics who are looking for a good springboard to further their studies on the Passion and the Catholic Church in general.  Also recommended to Protestants wanting to comprehend some of the Catholic symbolism in the film and any one interested in learning about the Passion.
