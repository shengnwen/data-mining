Yet another case of man's inhumanity to fellow beings. The story is a fiction, but could very well be a true one. Yakov Bok is a remarkable character who hung on to dear life, even in instances where the average person would have just given up. Bibikov brought some beam of hope into Bok's life, only to be taken too soon - an example of hope being shattered in the most desperate of situations. Familiar? The story was well written and is easy to relate to. It's a fiction that is consistant with historical facts. It is highly reminiscent of Nazi Germany and the experiences of Jews in general all over the world. Most admirable, however, was the relationship between Bok and Shmuel (his father-in-law). This book is a must-read
