The title of this book is a line from William Blake's famous poem called The Tyger.  It was the possibility of getting a glimpse of Mr. Blake in his natural habitat that drew me to read the novel.  I was not disappointed.
  
The portrayal of Mr. Blake was smoothly woven into a coming of age story that mingled aptly with the tensions of a tumultuous 18th Century London setting.  Mr. Blake's poem provides comfort that there is beauty in the things that seem scary.  We experience a scary London through adolescent country children Jem and Maise who are newly exposed to the raucous city. Brother and sister meet up with the streetwise London native, teenage Maggie.  The newness and stress of initially learning about an adult world parallels the feelings of the societal upheaval around them.  Everything moves forward and nothing will ever be the same as it was in the past.

The story moves quickly divided up by select months from 1792-3.  I cared about what happened to the characters which compelled me to keep reading.  It took a few chapters to grow accustomed to reading the phonetic spellings of a Dorsetshire accent and some 18th Century English speech.  The ending left us at the start of a new life creating the sense that we had had the privilege of seeing a chunk of life cut from that time period
