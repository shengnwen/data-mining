On the first CD, Drs. Weil and Rossman present a nicely threaded conversational  discussion of the current conceptions underlying approaches to mind/body healing. For the new listener it is very informative and inviting, for the experienced listener it is  reinforcing and encouraging. The second CD provides three guided imagery exercises designed to elicit and experience the concepts of safe personal place, inner healing wisdom, and facing symptoms or problems with a creative exploration for solution. Dr. Rossman's voice is very soothing and patient, fostering a sense of invitation and permissive guiding. While the three relaxation induction sequences are repetitive due to being identical, they should be viewed and understood as discrete experiences which normally would not be done back to back. Relaxation and meditation are best mastered through repetition and consistency. For those of us more experienced it is sometimes difficult to allow ourselves the opportunity to go the way of an other, and will be challenged with overcoming our own critical resistance.  The principle imagery experience and learning to be gained from each sequence, beyond the relaxation induction itself, comes from the personal place imagery recruitment, inviting and meeting a representation of our inner healing wisdom, and creating a symptom/problem/solution dialogue. These pieces are each very nicely constructed and contain a wealth of practical modeling points for the kinds of words and phrasing that can be used to optimize seeking, and thus, open to the creative healing wisdom that lies within.
