This is one of my favorite study books (and I have many).  If you are using audio tapes to learn Italian, then this is the perfect companion for those people (like myself) who are "visual" learners. Just about every page has several small pen & ink illustrations. The book is organized into short lessons/chapters, followed by short question & answer pages.  It is all kept very simple and is geared for the traveler.  A great bargain at this price, too.  
As for the "inferior printing job" as described by another reviewer:  This paperback IS printed on inexpensive, newsprint-type paper, and occasionally the dot on top of an "i" will connect to the bottom and it will come out looking like an "l". I personally didn't find it much of a problem.
