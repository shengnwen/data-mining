If you read only one, perhaps this should be it.  I am not a trained student of Hemingway, or of literature for that matter.  I know what I like, and I can recognize junk.  You don't have to be an expert or even fully understand the author and his times to appreciate what a superb novel this is.  As I was reading it, I could realize why Hemingway was so honored, even during his lifetime.  The story is basic, though the setting is in unsual one for most American readers (who today probably would guess that the "Spanish Civil War" has something to do with General Lee and the Alamo).  The main character, Robert Jordan, is an American leftist attached to a guerilla unit in the Spanish mountains.  Like Hemingway, Jordan is intelligent, deliberate, controlled, passionate, and motivated by his ideals.  Through him the reader encounters the chaos of this amateur war that is being played by foreign professionals.  The entire book, which is of some size, revolves around one mission and take places over only a couple of days.  In addition to a political statement and a philosophical autobiography, this is a superb war novel.  The book build up the mission (to destroy a bridge) so much that by the closing pages of the book, as the mission is unfolding, my heart was literally racing and I could not put the book down.  I won't spoil it - but this one ends like so may of EH's books, and like EH thought life itself would end . . . .
Great book - don't miss this classic
