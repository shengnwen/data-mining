Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey is one of the most enjoyable detective characters of the genre.  Set in the 1920's, this English mystery series portrays Lord Peter as a highly intelligent, intuitive amateur sleuth.  He has many other talents: he is an accomplished pianist, a collector of antiquarian books, cricketeer (a star when he was in school), has a charming and self-deprecating manner and it is hinted at throughout the series that he is accomplished at love-making having had several quite satisfied mistresses.

In this installment, Lord Peter meets the woman of his dreams.  She is on trial for murder and he must find out who committed the crime in order for her to be set free.  He commences courting her in prison and is in emotional turmoil due to his fears he will not be able to solve this crime. 

Lord Peter's object of affection, Harriet Vane, is a very interesting woman--a modern woman who is independent and has been leading a non-traditional lifestyle.  She is unconventionally beautiful with an unusually deep voice and writes detective novels.   A nice addition to the series.  

Making Lord Peter have a personal stake in solving the crime, rather than just an intellectual exercise, created a nice tension in this novel.  This happened before when Lord Peter's brother was on trial for murder.  Lord Peter is known for his calm under stress and in this case seeing him as an agonized lover added to the suspense as well as increasing the attraction of the Lord Peter character.
