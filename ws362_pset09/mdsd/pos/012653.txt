Hopkirk delivers a wonderful book in his look at how the British Empire was forced to respond to Germany's attempts to destroy its empire. The book is the most terrifying installment of the series as Hopkirk describes Germany's efforts to raise a holy war in the Middle East.  The efforts of the British to stop it are impressive and once again show the triumph and finesse of the British imperial system.  This is another fascinating book that looks at how the British empire lasted throughout the turbulent years of world war 1.  As always the book is very well written and impressively displayed.
