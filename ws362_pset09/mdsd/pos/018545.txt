The story  "Haunting of Hill House" has great examples of people changing just to fit in.   Although the "Haunting of Hill House" fits this description perfectly with its eerie description of supernatural tales of the happenings of Hill House; there is more to it than hauntings.  The story starts out with three guests being invited to the house to monitor any out of the ordinary occurrences in Hill House.  Throughout the story the guests experience some ghostly moments.  However during this, one of the guest named Eleanor changes her ways to fit in with the guests. One example would be when Eleanor told lies about herself and her past, and when Eleanor went around the house alone having no fear.  Finally Eleanor became open and spoke out what was on her mind. 
     In the story Eleanor feels that she does not fit in with the group of people who are staying at Hill House.  She is a person with a lack of confidence so she feels she has to lie to feel accepted.  Theo came through the bathroom door into Eleanor's room, she is lovely, Eleanor thought, turning to look, I wish I were lovely."  This quote shows the lack of confidence she has.  One of Eleanor's lies was when she told the others she lived alone in an apartment. We all know this is to be untrue because she lives with her sister and husband in a house.  The reason she told this lie was because Theo lived in an apartment with a friend so she felt Theo would not accept her. It was sad that there was such lack of self esteem in Eleanor, that she could not be her own person!  
  I though the story was more than just paranormal things, it was a story of a lost women finding herself!
