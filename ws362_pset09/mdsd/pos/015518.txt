For those of you comparing the literary qualities of this book with "Catch Me If You Can", note that Abagnale did not write that book. He only told his story to the real writer. You can read Abagnale's comments about this at his website at http://www.abagnale.com/comments.htm.

Having said that, I will say that Abagnale has plentiful good advice about taking precautionary steps to protect yourself from fraud. If you don't feel sufficiently informed on that subject, this book is an eye-opening source of information about the threats and the steps you can take to protect yourself. 

Abagnale's grasp of complex computer security topics isn't very strong. But that is a fast-changing subject that might be better researched online than in books, which are necessarily a bit behind the times
