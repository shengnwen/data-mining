This book is one of the best of its type, Mr. Yamazaki and Mr. Kojima should be congratulated for all the work that they have put into it.  The photography is excellent and the whole book is beautifully presented.  I may be a little biased as l own the brown Bearded Collie pictured in the book but l think that the book really blows away other similiar books about dogs on the market.  A must have if you are looking at purchasing a puppy / dog
