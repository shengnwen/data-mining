Not counting his volumes of limericks, this is Isaac Asimov's second jokebook, following Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor. Like that first book, however, this is much more than simply a collection of jokes. Asimov discusses, in his usual prolific style, the nature of jokes and joketelling, what makes some things funny and others fall flat, and why he prefers some jokes to others. Although he intentionally steers away from topical humor, some of the jokes are still outdated simply because of the evolution of language and culture, but the book is still a great read and a full of laughs. It's a lot of fun
