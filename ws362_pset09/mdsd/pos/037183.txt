I would assume people who read this book would be the ones who already have good experience in stock trading. The author did a good job in explaining the macro-economic factors (money supply, interest rate,...). You have to get good understanding on all these before you can do good in future trading. 

The author also did a good job in describing complicated topids in a simple and clean way. He is writing the book base on his experience and insight. He definitely is the kind of person who knows a lot and also know how to teach you things in a simple form.
