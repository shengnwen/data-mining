Not for the faint hearted. Readers can expect to suffer through numerous footnotes, and liberal sprinklings of quotes in Greek, Latin, French and German. That is not to say that the author has done a poor job. The content is very informative, just slow reading.

The author has provided a well put together, bien tenu, history of piracy in the Mediterranean from ancient times to the formation of the Roman empire, first century A.D. based upon the writings of semi-contemporary authors and ancient authors, such as Xenophon, Cicero, Plutarch and such. The content was originally published in 1924 by the Liverpool University Press. The two maps attached to the end of the text are very helpful at finding the many locations cited by the author.

Bottom line, be prepared for a non-trivial read.
