Roger Kahn captures the flavor of the era when for all but two seasons from (1947-1957) a New York baseball team won the World Series.  The author focuses more heavily on a couple of those seasons, with tidbits on star players (Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, Pee Wee Reese, etc.), team owners, sports writers and managers.  I particularly liked the author's coverage of the 1947 season and 1951 Giant/Dodgers playoff.  He also gives us a sense of business, including the rise of Walter O'Malley, the falling of attendance during the era, and the machinations that resulted in the Dodgers and Giants deserting the city for California.  

This readable book has its flaws.  The author's coverage of each season is out of balance, he suggests that Willie Mays was the game's top player (in the 1950's Mantle was probably better), and he shows no sense of the longing and bitterness in the many big-league cities where pennants are rarely if ever won.  

Kahn is a marvelous writer, but his readable prose never approaches the poetic level found in some of his other books (Boys of Summer, Flame or Pure Desire, Memories of Summer).  This book is definitely worth reading, but it falls a short of his best writing on baseball.
