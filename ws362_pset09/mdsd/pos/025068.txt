Despite it making it sound so easy to win in the market, I liked the book. In my opinion the book belongs to the list of better ones on investment advice. Instead of launching into predictions on how the market will behave, or suggesting technology stocks for their fantastic futuristic stories, Lynch offers down to earth advice, though perhaps with down to earth language as well. He finds value in conventional businesses, and he clearly explains why. He asserts that amateurs can be as good or even better than investment professionals as long as they keep their eyes and ears open. One needs to try things (the products of the company whose stock you are interested in) out oneself in order to understand the products' values.

As with any other book on investment the author states things that are downright wrong (why should short-selling be described: "it's more like borrowing with criminal intent"), but his exposition exudes a quality that can only come from having an abundance of experience. I also appreciated his honesty.

Having said this much, what I really got out from the book: 1) one needs to classify stocks and set specific investment objectives for each of them prior to purchase, and 2) "do not pluck the flowers and water the weeds." To elaborate on the latter, I have been selling winners prematurely and waiting for laggards to bounce back to my purchase price in order to avoid loss. A common mistake most likely, but something that would have been left under the blind spot unless I'd seen it articulated
