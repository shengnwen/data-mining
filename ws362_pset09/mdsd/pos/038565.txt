I happened across this book by accident, took a chance and ordered it, and am experiencing sheer joy reading the variety of tutorials it contains.  femme digitale covers so much...2D, 3D, Painter and Photoshop techniques...it's almost overwhelming, but reading it is tons of fun.  If you like to paint beautiful women, you'd really enjoy this book.

One drawback is -- Poser is relied on quite heavily by some of the contributing artists.  However, since the book explains how to build your own 3D models (or even use a live model in place of the Poser figures), that's not a concrete limitation.  I have Poser and Lightwave, so I can build my own models if I'd get off my lazy bum and do it -- which means the book is doubly valuable for me.

I highly recommend femme digitale and gave it five stars for content.  The binding could be a bit more sturdy, but the glorious artwork and the information it offers compensates for that flaw.
