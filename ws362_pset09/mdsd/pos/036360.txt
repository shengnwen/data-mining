The best part of reading this book is that it is divided by generation & by character. And each character is unforgetable. Undoubtedly, Mrs Colleen McCoullough is a magnificient writer. Meg, the central character, is someone many women would relate to and her character has evolved masterfully. A story of an amazing set of individuals who are bound together with a common thread-LOVE.

Most of all, it gives a perfect picture of Australian outback life, its cruel 'down sides' & beautiful & serene 'upsides'.

Read this book and immerse yourself into the life of these wonderful family.
