The &quot;Conflict and Communication Activity Book&quot; is an excellent resource for trainers and facilitators in any organization.  I particularly liked how Withers and Lewis formatted the book, defining up front the purpose as well as the equipment, prep and time needed for each specific exercise.  The clear instructions and helpful advice provided for each activity make them a breeze for any professional to use.  Well done!!  As I read through it the first time, I found myself book-marking several of the activities to make a point of trying in the near future.  I long ago arrived at the conclusion that no organization will EVER stop dealing with conflict and communication issues.  They're universal.  Thanks for giving me thirty more creative exercises to include in my bag of tricks!
