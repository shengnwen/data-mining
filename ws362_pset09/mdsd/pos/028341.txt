If you're serious about your NLHE game then ALL of the Harrington on Hold'em books are required reading.  I've read and re-read each of the volumes several times.  I've seen my understanding of the game evolve in real time.  There aren't any books better for NLHE tournament play. These books are worth at least 3 times their retail price.

Dan Harrington is an elite poker player, having won the WSOP in 95 and making the final table in 03 and 04.  Is there a better NLHE teach out there?

I will say occassionally I have disagreed with some of his teachings, but rarely.  One specific case is his chapter on heads up play.  He says you should call from the small blind with almost any two cards because you will likely have the pot odds.  True, but do you really want to waste your chips with 3-7 offsuit?  Your opponent raises and then you've got to give up half a blind.  Why not just fold the junk and raise with everything else (per John Vorhaus in Killer Online Poker 2)?  I think while the chapter is technically correct it is not necessarily the best way to play, especially if you're playing in a 10 player sitngo tournament where the blinds may be quite high by the time you get heads up.  Of course it could just be a matter of personal style.  What works for one person doesn't necessarily fit for another.  There are no absolute right ways to play poker, but there are many wrong ways.
