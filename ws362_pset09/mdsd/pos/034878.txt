What is more lovely than a platter full of tiny White Russian Cupcakes and Lemon Cupcakes at a baby shower? And following the author's suggestions, I even made up fortunes and inserted them in each cupcake. Guests were able to sample a variety, and (in combination with a lot of cheesecakes) no dessert table ever looked more inviting.  Word of warning:   I'm a librarian, so I checked this book out of the library. My daughter liked it so much, I had to buy it for her. Always one more recipe to try! And so many useful tips.
