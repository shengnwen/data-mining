A stellar examination of the past, present, and portents of "The Sopranos"!  Wow!  From the die-hard Soprano fans to all those interested schlumps, this book is the must-read needed on their bookself.  An entertaining, voyeuristic, and compassionate look at the Sopranos' lives that mix reality and myth into a remarkable anthology of today's most famous mobster family.  The show earned its Emmys and then some; the book compliments the show with its photos and commentary on what will become the most talked about series for years to come.  In my opinion, there are only a handful of shows that truly deserve such an in-depth perspective as this one does- and this one hits the mark!  Two enthusiastic thumbs up and a congratulations going toward the talented and witty writer, Allen Rucker, the only one who made this fantastic book possible for all Soprano aficionados to thoroughly enjoy.  Rucker brings an unique standpoint to the Sopranos' family and lifestyle that I never knew existed.  I hope he writes the next updated version!  If not, "I have friends, you know!
