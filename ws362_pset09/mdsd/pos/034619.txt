Pearl is a lot smarter than some of the other VC Andrew's characters, but I found some things to be odd. I couldn't figure out why she called her parents &quot;mommy and daddy&quot; when she is 17 years old. She was very strong when she tried to find her mother, but I felt like when she found Jack, she fell for him a little quickly. He could have easily just turned out to be some jerk. This story line is a little different than the other novels, there are not as many twists and turns. Basically the biggest part of the novel was finding her mother Ruby. I give it 4 stars because I didn't find it as interesting or unique as the other novels, but it is good
