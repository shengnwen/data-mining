One of the most interesting classical Greek texts. If you are interested in ancient Greece, you must read PAUSANIAS !   Of course Pausanias' series in the Loeb classical library are the best. And I don't agree with the  policy of Penguin Classic's translator. However I recommend the book for  English-speaking people who cannot read Classical Greek
