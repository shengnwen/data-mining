This book is perfect for the young adult-to-adult reader.  There is very little if any at all bad language or content.  Although it was a good book, it did get a little boring at times for lack of "edge of your seat" suspense.  The book has many characters but they all tie together in the end.

 Throughout the story a young woman named Darcy meets these characters by answering personal ads to find her best friend's (Erin) killer after she is found dead.  Her murder seems to be similar to seven other murders/disappearances: the Dancing Shoe Murders.  Darcy is determined to find the killer no matter the risk.
 
 It definitly keeps you guessing "who dunnit" until the end.  For those who are looking for a good, clean murder mystery with a higher level of reading, this book is for you.
