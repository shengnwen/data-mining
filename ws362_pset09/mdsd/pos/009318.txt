I bought this novel on the strength of an extracted chapter in an anthology on 5 decades of popular music; it was included in the section covering disco. The chapter in question (taken from an early part of the book) is mesmerizing. It describes the rise and subsequent decline of the fictitious (I think!) Twelfth Floor nightclub in Manhattan ca. 1976. I wasn't let down by the rest of the book, though I agree with the reviewer (below) who remarked that Holleran has been known to lapse into purple prose at times. Sometimes his descriptions of sizzling summers, endless autumn afternoons, etc., are rendered beautifully, and sometimes they just miss the mark. It doesn't matter so much, since he has created what may be (dare I say) the definitive, most-likely-to-last novel of gay life in Manhattan and Fire Island in the disco era. The character of "sweet prince" Malone, by the way, seems to me more like a dream than anything else - a combination (highly arguably) of a venerated gay angel and an idealized version of Holleran himself?

I do find that, in spots, Holleran is too self-consciously trying to create a 'lyrical' novel (and he may have let himself be influenced too much by Scott Fitzgerald, as pointed out by another reviewer.) The book also gets repetitive at times in its descriptions of, for example, the generic dark-eyed Puerto Rican messenger boys that turn up everywhere. (OK, I didn't live through the era, and I would have been female at that, so I'm probably not the best person to judge.) The letters at the beginning and end of the novel are well crafted, sad, touching and funny, and the character of Sutherland (similar to the drag queen mentor described in Edmund White's "The Beautiful Room is Empty" is wise and memorable. 4 stars from this "uninitiated" reader.
