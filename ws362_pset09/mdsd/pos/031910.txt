If you've watched the news lately, you've probably heard about Skidmore. It's where the woman was killed and her baby was stolen from her womb.

But Skidmore got its notoriety in the 1980s when a man was killed in front of a group of people. "In Broad Daylight" details that story in its chilling entirety. Probably not since the West Memphis Three has there been a crime involving ordinary citizens so compelling. It lacks all the glitz and glamor of the OJ or Robert Blake cases, but I think it has so much more to say. A great study in vigilante justice
