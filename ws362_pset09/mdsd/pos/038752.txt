There is a long tradition of short stories in the field of SF.  As Arthur C. Clarke said in his introduction to the new book Science Fiction Quotations, "...the short story is to science fiction what the sonnet is to the epic poem." Link's stories here all have an appropriately poetic feel.  Every story here creates a sense of wonder and magic.  The kinds of stories that will lull the reader, where reading stops and immersion begins.
