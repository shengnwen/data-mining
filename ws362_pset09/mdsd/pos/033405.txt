Be prepared to sit on the edge of your seat through this entire book!  To answer another reviewer's question: Yes, there are men out there who think this way and having Rob Winters be a policeman really made this book stressful.

Mary Grace was a textbook case of little self esteem, getting pregnant too young and looking for love.  Her love and protection for her son were awesome. I loved the fact that she hadnt even let another guy near her or her son, protecting only her child,  until she fell in love in Max.  A great many abuse cases seek another guy almost immediately and choose the same scum.

After working in the field so many years, I am sorry to say that I fully support the death penalty and that restraining orders are a waste of paper.  

Places like Hanover House have done magnificant work.  Loving homes and families are truly an answer to society's ills.  The one in this book proved to be one.

Time does indeed heal all wounds; you just have to live long enough to find that out.
