Tarzan is not politically correct, is anthropologically naive, is just short of racist, sexist and a certain fantasy.  In the end, none of that matters.  Tarzan is the hereo upon which all attention centers, and that is how it should be.  Edgar Rice Burrough's classic pulp fiction work reads nearly as strongly today as it did almost a hundred years ago.  So what if his "apes" never really existed (although, one is tempted to think of them as some lost tribe of giant Australopithcines, improperly classified and then rendered extinct before they could be correctly classified.  Borroughs was writing at the start of the sixth great age of extinctions, after all).  Sparing in his prose, as many victorian writers were, Borroughs manages to stir the imagination to treetop heights and we really care what happens to the orphan Tarzan as he becomes a man.  Tarzan's initiation into the world of Western man is perhaps more unbelievable than his more gradual and much earlier settling into the ape world, and less satisfying.  We lose Tarzan when we lose the "ape-man" but his devotion to the comely Jane is genuine and compelling.  In short, go Tarzan!
A note on the booksurge volume: it had a mistake in paragraphing almost certainly not in the original, inconsistent page breaks between chapters, and a back cover blurb which was literally a non-sensical half-sentence.  There was no bio of the author or even previous publishing credits.  This classic author deserves much better
