All of Sharon Penman's books are well researched, and if she does change an event for story purposes, she points this out in her author notes.  The books in this trilogy bring historical characters to life in a manner seldom found in historical novels.  I highly recommend these books for anyone who is interested in early medieval England and Wales, especially the times of King John, King Henry III, and the Lleweyllens of Wales
