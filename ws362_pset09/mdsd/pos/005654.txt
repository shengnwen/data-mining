Flush by Carl Hiaasen does not disappoint! Who knew that a story about raw sewage would rate five stars! Hiaasen's Flush does just that!
Noah and his sister Abby acquire some strange cohorts along the way as they try to keep their family from going down the drain! Sorry, but I just couldn't resist that pun!
Their father's action in sinking a floating casino leads them on a quest to not only help their father but to save the environment. Along the way you will see how setbacks will sometimes end up as a success while their successes often end up having unwanted consequences!
This was a Christmas present for our oldest granddaughter. 
She loved it! Carl Hiaasen is a terrific author. His writing has made us laugh out loud numerous times.
While this was written as a children's book, it was just as enjoyable for me to read as those geared to adults
