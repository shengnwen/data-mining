This is an interesting effort to make a general statement of Blackburn's views on epistemology.  Aimed at a general audience, Blackburn covers some different aspects of the realist/anti-realist debate including a taxonomy of realist and anti-realist positions and a brief precis of classical skepticism.  Blackburn is appropriately skeptical of anti-realism but very cautious about historic realist positions that require strong metaphysical claims.  He adopts a position of 'minimalism' which denies strong metaphysical claims but argues that statements carry with them their own criteria of truth.  Minimalism turns out to be a surprisingly strong position as the statements that carry their own truth criteria include all of the natural sciences and indeed almost all of routine life.  Though this position originates with work of the great logician Frege, it seems almost too good to be true and in Blackburn's relatively simple presentation, a bit of a linguistic trick.  Blackburn is better, I think, in his criticism of anti-realist positions.  He does a good job of showing the internal contradictions of many attacks on realism.  Richard Rorty, in particular, comes in for some pretty stringent (though polite) criticism for attempting to escape some of the logical extensions of his anti-realism by opening a backdoor to what are, de facto, forms of realism.  This book has a decent though hardly outstanding bibliography.
