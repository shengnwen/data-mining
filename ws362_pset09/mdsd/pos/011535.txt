Why it is the most fun book is because it is sad, funny, and it makes you think that it could happen to you. It held my intrest the whole time. I wanted to read more for homework!!! It is the third best book I ever read. My first is The Curse of Ravenscourt. My second is Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger. THANKS!!!!!!
