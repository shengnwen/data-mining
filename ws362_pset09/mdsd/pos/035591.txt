i really like this dog book.  it covers a few different subjects, like dog  groups and dog history.  it is mainly a breed guide.  it does have a  glossary though!  that comes in quite handy for those who are just getting  started in the wonderful world of dogs.  i would recommend it too anyone  looking for &quot;the perfect dog&quot; since it has soooo much info. on  soooo many breeds
