This is the fourth novel by Preston and Childs that I've read, and in my opinion, it is their best so far. Though one is able to guess at the identity of the killer half-way through the book, the specific nature and origin of the entity is not fathomable until it is specifically revealed.

Pendergast is as good as ever, though I found his personal history to be a bigger enigma than the one posed by the killer. I'm looking forward to reading the books that delve into the Pendergast family history.

To nit-pick, although completely engrossing the authors overplayed the physical abilities of the killer in the storyline, especially given his apparent age. For that, it gets 4 stars rather than 5. It was just too difficult for me to realistically believe that the killer, as described, would have been capable of some of the feats ascribed to him. Had they toned down that aspect of the story, the book would have been just as gripping, but would have been much more believable.

I am a definite fan of Preston and Childs, and this book is highly recommended
