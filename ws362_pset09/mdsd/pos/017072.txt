While Dr. Cytowic's book mainly deals with his investigation of the rare neurological phenomena called "synesthesia", his resulting insights on emotions, reasoning and consciousness are really what make this book worth  reading. He presents "The New View of How the Brain Works". A view that  helps us understand the critical interaction of emotions and reasoning.  If  you are open-minded and ready to give an alternate point of view a chance,  you will find this book to be truly enlightening, absorbing, thought  provoking and enjoyable. If you are close-minded and think that science  already has all the right answers - don't waste your time - try science  fiction instead
