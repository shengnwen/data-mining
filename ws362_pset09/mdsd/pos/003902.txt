This has got to be one of the most well put-together automotive do-it-yourself books I've seen in some time, whether Porsche or otherwise. The photos are extremely clear and detailed, in contrast to most auto manuals (even the factory oftentimes). The instructions are informative and even present alternatives or commentary on aspects of the project (for example, mentioning that while the H4 headlight update gives better lighting, some people prefer the profile of the original earlier headlamps on SCs). In addition, the initial summary boxes, which give statistics such as complexity of the job, time necessary, approximate cost, tools needed, etc. makes it easier to select a project for your next weekend, based on how much free time you have available. An excellent publication
