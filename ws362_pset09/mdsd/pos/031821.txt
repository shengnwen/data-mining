I think Mr. Kiyosaki became indeed rich with his "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" series and rightly so. However this particular book is just repeating of the same ideas I have seen in his other books with not much new information related to investing as the title suggested. In any case I  do recommend reading the original title "Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money--That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!"
