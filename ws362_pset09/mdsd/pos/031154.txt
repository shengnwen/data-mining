Orhan Pamuk's Istanbul--melancholy, decaying, and haunted by the memories of multiple shattered empires--does not even really exist anymore in quite the way he describes: the parts of the city which seem to him most characteristic of gorgeous and splendid decay have been largely rebuilt today, so that what seems most characteristic to him of Istanbul is something contemporary visitors to the city will have to seek out for themselves behind the bustle of Sultanahmet and Beyï¿½glu. But that makes his beautiful Sebaldian memoir of the city no less powerful nor evocative, and Pamuk draws a beautiful correspondence between the aging metropolis and his young self trying to find a vocation in a city that offers all kinds of possibilities to him he cannot fully see. (The memoir in many ways evokes Joyce's PORTRAIT, especially in the narrator's final recounting of a conversation with his mother when he decides upon his career.) This is a splendid introduction to Pamuk, the best-known Turkish novelist in the United States, and to his beloved city--even if the city he describes exists mostly in memory
