When I picked this up, I was starting an upswing in my relationship with the Lord, but I had no idea how deeply I personally could abide in Him until I read this book. I've never read of anyone whose faith was greater than Rees's outside of the Bible. I continue to meditate on the wonders described in this book. It's well written and totally moving.

If you want a look into what the Lord WANTS you to have in Him, this is the book for you. I recommend it to all of my Christian friends
