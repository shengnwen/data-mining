This short book has a few lines of simple text for each two-page illustration about the winter habits of various animals.  The author looks at animals like monarch butterflies which fly south, animals that hibernate like the woodchuck, and the animals which continue to forage in the winter like the pika, deer, and mice.  The drawings are lovely in detail.  This book would be ideal to read to a child at bedtime on a nice winter night.
