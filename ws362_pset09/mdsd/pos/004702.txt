Tana Hoban's Exactly the Opposite is a wonderful book to use with young  children who are learning the concept of &quot;opposite&quot;. This  wordless book allows readers to interpret the photographs as they  understand them.A photograph shows two hands - one is open and the other  closed. Two photographs show children on steps - in one picture they are  going up and in the other they are coming down. In another photograph there  are two shoes - one tied and one untied. Children can act out these  opposites by opening and closing their hands, undoing a shoelace and so on.  The photographs are large, clear, colorful and attention-grabbers for young  children. Exactly the Opposite is exactly the right book to teach the  concept of opposites to young children
