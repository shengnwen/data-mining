I am 27 years old and my father passed away in March at the age of 52.  He died very unexpectedly.  I really enjoyed the style of this book, but the personal stories seemed a little out of date for a younger person and also  for a daughter.  I would suggest this for a male in his middle life, whose  father died as an older man.  That seems to be the main focus of this book,  as that was the author's experience
