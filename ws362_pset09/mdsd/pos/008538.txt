To call this book a chronology would be a mistake because the art work of the Genius Alex Ross is not presented in chronological order, but rather starts with the most popular characters Superman, Batman, etc., and then moves on to other work such as Justice League of America, Kingdom Come, Alan Moore, etc.
Alex Ross is arguably the greatest visual artist of our time. As far as I am concerned his work is up there with Picasso, Da Vinci and Degas. This book takes the reader in a character-and event-based journey of Alex Ross's incredible work. What Ross and this book have in common are the incredible attention to detail and color. The art presented in this book is so rich in color it is almost unreal. The pictures carry unbelievable detail, down to the pores on the faces of the Superman and Batman sculptures. I have never seen such a visual fest in any other comic or movie-related book, I guarantee you you will not be disappointed, it doesn't even matter whether you are a comic book fan or not. Ross's modern day interpretation in the recreation of the art work from 40s, 50s and 60s comic book covers is so nostalgic and professional it makes you appreciate his talent even more.
This is one book not to miss. The print quality is extremely high, and pictures carry a ridiculous amount of detail and color. Especially if you are a Superman or Batman fan, you are on for a treat as they are most prominently featured in this book.
This is one great book, I have always been a huge Alex Ross fan, but thanks to this book I now feel like I know him personally (through his art presented in this book as well as the narration in the text that accompanies the pictures).
One last note: Get the hardcover if you can, the art work on the sleeve is much better than the paperback cover, and the art work on the front and back of the hard cover book is simply incredible
