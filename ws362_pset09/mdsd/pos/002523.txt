I just read through my friends copy of this, and added it to my wishlist.  This book describes, step by step, the theory of short row sock making.  

As far as the sizing goes, it relies very much on careful measurement and knowing the gauge you are working.  Doing test swatches to measure gauge is essential to figuring out how many stitches to cast on.  Don't go by the gauge on the yarn package, what any given person knits often has nothing to do with what the yarn maker imagines.  

The pictures could use some improvement.  As others have said, it isn't always clear which step a particular picture belongs to, and not every step has a picture.  I do prefer the line drawings to photographs, since it is often difficult to track where the yarn goes in photographs of knitting.  But it would have been good to hire a professional illustrator with some knowledge of knitting, rather than having the author do the pictures, so that they would be drawn with more technical skill.  

It would also have been good if she offered both left handed and right handed instructions, particularly for the cast-ons and bind-offs.  I'm an oddity, I knit left handed continental style, and I can tell that interpreting some of these cast-on/bind-off techniques is going to be tricky.  

This is a book for the foot of the sock, look elsewhere for interesting patterns for the cuffs and legs.
