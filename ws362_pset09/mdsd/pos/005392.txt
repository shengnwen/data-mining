I thought the book was well written and easy to follow. One of the reasons why I picked it up was because it took place (at least partially) in Mexico. Howard did a good job of infusing Spanish words and little bits of info throughout the text in a knowledgable and believable way. The main event behind the story was both realistic and interesting enough to make me continue reading. I don't generally read romance novels and had no idea this was one (found it on a random shelf at the library) until there was a chapter or two devoted to sex thrown in there. It read like a mystery novel throughout the majority of the book. I could have done without the mindless sex and felt as if the love match in the end was very strange. I did not think the man was romantic at all. Overall this was a good book.
