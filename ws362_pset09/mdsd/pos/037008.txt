Kathy Dobie's book is truely great.  She talked about the stereotypes put on women and reminds us that even today some things haven't changed regarding womens sexuality and how open they can be regarding their sexual practices but still reminds me a 23 years old women that stereotypes are still alive today.  Many women can identify with her life and sexual experience whether good or bad.  I couldnt put the down I finished it in one night.  Truely amazing
