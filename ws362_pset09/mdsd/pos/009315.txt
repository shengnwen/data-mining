Sky Tree shows how a tree growing on a hill by a river changes through all four seasons. Locker's oil paintings are beautiful and accurate. The text records the changes the tree experiences in simple language. There are questions at the bottom of each page where text appears that provoke discussion. At the end of the book, Locker gives a scientific explanation of each of the paintings: the summer tree, the change tree, the autumn tree, etc. This is a great book to use for teaching about the world of nature
