I found this volume useful and informative. It deals primarily with how Congress and the president shape American trade relations. It also considers the role of other domestic factors, such as interest groups. Destler explains various general approaches to the study of how American policy-makers arrive at a particualr type of trade policy. The main target audience is graduate and undergraduate students in public policy, American politics, and international political economy
