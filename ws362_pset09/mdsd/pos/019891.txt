I've had this book on my shelves for years and re-read it yesterday.  Found it delightful and laughed out loud at some things.

I was confused by the mention of "HAL" in the first sentence as given on this site.  There is no one named Hal in the story.  Then I saw the problem.  I have a Vintage Books edition where the first words of a chapter are in caps.  The last word of the first sentence is "HAD".  Part of the letter D has been cut off as has part of an e at the end of the second line.

Back to the story.  Descriptions of funeral homes for people and pets are so good.  I loved the little notes that Dennis sent about pets being in heaven and wagging their tails
