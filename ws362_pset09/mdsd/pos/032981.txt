The books is a take off of one of the stories from David Weber's Colletion of Bolo stories entitled "BOLO!" and I found it a decent read.

Captain M is a wounded Bolo commander and would like nothing better than to have died with her Bolo... But soldiers sometimes aren't given a choice and she is sent off to defend a secret mission to establish a colony where hopefully the Dog Boys won't find it.

But unfortunately things don't go according to plan and the enemy does find them. To make a long story short, victory while costly doesn't destroy the colony... But it does give Captain M a much longer lease on life as a Bolo commander... 

I found this book to a good deal better than the previous effort by Weber's Bolo! Definately a good read if you like David Weber and Bolo's
