How does one talk about a collection of short stories such as this? Simply, it is a mixed bag.  Fortunately, if you know to read it for the atmosphere that he creates, both emotionally and as he talks about physical surroundings, you can become thoroughly engrossed.  This much he keeps in common with the vast majority of his other works.  If you are reading it however for character development, you will likely be disappointed.

It opens brilliantly enough with the short Johnny Mnemonic.  Johnny introduces or reintroduces you to characters from his Cyberspace or Sprawl trilogy of novels.  This is its strong suit.  It leaves one wondering about how the characters stay so one-dimensional.  Change, in this case, would be bad.

Throughout his middleworks, Fragments of a Hologram Rose, The Belonging Kind, etc, you are left with emotional points, but nothing truly wrenching.  The only constant is the fact that when he describes a scene, he places so much detail into it that you can all but see it through the eyes of his characters.  Yet again, typical of his style overall.

The closer, Burning Chrome, is early Gibson at his finest.  Atmosphere, poetic verse written as prose, and emotional tension that grabs you.  All in all, it is the fact that he can write a dystopian world that is so much a parallel of our own that we are forced to suspend disbelief just long enough to get lost in it.  The beauty here is that you can cover this fine point over the course of a portion of a lunch hour.

One reads Burning Chrome as a collection, not to read about characters, but rather to experience parts of their world, and in the end, get glimpses of the visionary that was an early William Gibson.  If you read for the characters you will be disappointed.  If you read to experience a world defined as poetry hidden in lines of prose, you will find something pleasant, but far from perfect
