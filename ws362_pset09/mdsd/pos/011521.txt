I loved the book and bought the CD to listen to while on long drives.  It's one of King's best restrained writings, with no stomch turning descriptions of blood and gore and very little off the wall, meaningless intrusion of aliens which characterize some of his other novels (Dreamcatcher, Regulators etc.)  The only thing off-putting was the extremely poor diction of William Hurt.  He routinely pronounced t's and d's as "tha," which may come across as laid back in a movie role, but in a reading sounds just plain sloppy. I would have given it five stars except for Hurt. I sincerely hope he is not used in readings again, at least until he receives some speech therapy.
