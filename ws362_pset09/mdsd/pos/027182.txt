This beautiful translation gets to the heart of the yoga sutras, and makes for beautiful, inspiring reading.  Especially useful for anyone who has been intimidated by traditional translations which are not very readable.  This book is a wonderful gift to anyone interested in yoga and inspirational reading regardless of whether you have been practice yoga for years, or are newly discovering this ancient tradition.  Highly recommended!
