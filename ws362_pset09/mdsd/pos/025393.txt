This book is just what I needed to start me on the invention process.  It showed me what the next steps are after you have that "good idea".  Don lists many resources and throughout the book gives snapshots of his  experiences.  It was a big help and others can learn from it.  The more important point however, is that he informs you of many "watchouts" and potential inventors will gain the streetsmarts to move to the next level.
