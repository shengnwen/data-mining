Or for that matter, why else would the same media that ignores the ever increasing dangers and failures presented by Bush's Iraq War choose to give more air time to Michael Jackson and Scott Peterson? I would have appreciated it if the author had talked about why the voters and the Democrats are not standing up to the corrupt kon-servative media and government and holding them accountable. Other than that, I think this book is a beginning step to correctly informing the misinformed
