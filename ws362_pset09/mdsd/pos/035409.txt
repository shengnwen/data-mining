Hugo's classic is the ultimate un-love story. It presents at least three central characters brimming with unrequited love and another couple of central characters who don't seem to know how to love. Amongst the unrequited "loves," one case is pure lust mistaken for love and another is complete infatuation mistaken for love. The book also reads as a case study in the potential ramifications of bitterness. Hugo also draws wonderful characters: the archdeacon of Notre Dame is one of the scariest villains I've seen, and the spineless poet Gringoire is attractive though unreliable. The story is fascinating and heart-rending.

But the book also feels schizophrenic: Hugo delivers suspense-filled scenes, engaging dialogue, intriguing characters, breathtaking action...and then interrupts it with pages and pages of the history of Parisian architecture or the relative benefits of astrology versus alchemy. It's reminiscent of Moby Dick in that way: excitement interspersed with mind-numbing boredom. But the reflections on the heart are worth it: just don't be afraid to skip a few pages.

I read (or listened to, actually), the Lowell Bair translation, which had some interesting and clever phrasing that I didn't find in other translations I examined. On Amazon, that translation is only available abridged (maybe not a bad idea) as a Bantam Classic, so the unabridged version may be out of print. That said, other translations (such as this) may have other strengths (hence their still being in print)
