Overall, the book is informative, spiritually and mentally, about  homosexuality. It shows that  one's sexuality and one's walk with Christ  need  not be mutually exclusive, and in many cases,  CANNOT be mutually  exclusive. For homosexual christians, the book shows the   unconditional  love of Christ, regardless of sexuality. For non-homosexual christians, the  book is an inspiration on how they should &quot;love&quot; all their  brothers and sisters in christ, regardless of sexuality. (That is why I  said this is a must for all christians, and I would recommend it on the  book shelves at all churches, too)
