The first edition of Lonely Planet's Central Asia guide was not up to their usual standard.  Its data and advice was incomplete and even wrong, but more than anything, it was out-of-date beforen it was published: things had changed a great deal in Central Asia, between 1991 when the countries became independent, and 1996 when the guide was published.  But finally, this second recent edition of the book fully compensates for those lacks.  Truly up-to-date, it offers all the advice, tips and information that travellers expect to get from Lonely Planet.  And in this region, you'll need it !  Even if you speak Russian like myself, this is not an easy region to travel around.  The people are nice and hospitable, the places are marvellous, but the first impact can be very negative and gloomy.  It can be hard or impossible to get around - visas and other bureaucratic problems, flights and trains which may or may not run, hotels which may or may not exist...  You won't know what to do or where to go, and once you do you may realize you should have done otherwise.  With this guide, you won't be lost.  It will truly be your companion during the whole journey, whether or not you are familiar with the region.  And it will also provide excellent and very plesant reading with its sections on culture, history, politics, etc.  Last but not least, this edition contains two new sections on Afghanistan and on China's Xinjiang province.  Afghanistan will be hard to visit so far (but not impossible - ask me !), yet the information is invaluable and highly interesting.  Xinjiang is a destination which, thanks to the information contained in this guidebook (and ONLY thanks to that information, which you won't find elsewhere !), you will be able to combine with your trip to the five former Soviet nations of Central Asia.  Buy it now, and you will be on your way even sooner than you plan
