Since I've just finished the 25th Anniversary edition to this book three years after it was printed, I'm guessing that there have been an excess of reviews that have been written on it. I'm not sure that there is much to add...

Richard Foster has truly written a classic here. I approached it with some apprehension having heard that he is new-agish and unbiblical. I could detect neither in this material. Instead, I found a brother in Christ attempting to understand God with something more than just his mind using methods that are Biblical, orthodox, and practical for every believer. 

There are only two things that I think would have made Foster's book better. One would have been an inclusion of the idea of Sabbath (not as a legalistic day but as a lifestyle) or rest. Additionally, I think that Foster would have done well to include in the book a means of developing a rhythm of disciplines.

Overall, this is a highly recommended book and puts to words many of the pursuits that I have been yearning for in my own life for several years now. I'm glad that God brought this book across my path.
