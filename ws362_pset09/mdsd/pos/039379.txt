As a professional speaker and writer to parents I applaud and highly recommend this book!  Written as a dialogue between parent and child, we hear the innocence of a child and the wisdom of the parent. For each naive question the parent gently shares an applicable scripture in today's language.  When I speak on nurturing a child's spiritual development I ALWAYS recommend "Does God Know How to Tie Shoes?" to my audience. Not only can it help parents relate to their child but it can help us adults relate to our loving Heavenly Father.  Books that are easy to read were often difficult to write and it's a gift to communicate truth in simple ways. My book, Parenting Power in the Early Years, is an easy read and I know from experience the research and labor that went into its writing. This knowledge gives me an even greater appreciation for the profound simplicity of "Does God Know How to Tie Shoes?
