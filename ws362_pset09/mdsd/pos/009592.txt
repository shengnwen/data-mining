This is the 7th or 8th of Smiths wonderful story books I have read. What I enjoyed about 44 Scotland Street, as always, was the richness of character, the foibles, fears and strengths of these multiple and varying people who you feel you know on first aquaintance. The psychiatrist and overbearing mother take therapy to a whole new and perverse level! The narcissistic adonis, the bewildered young lady on a gap, the indecissive gallery manager are just a few of the treats in store. The ending of the book does not tie everything together in a neat package but you have enough at this point to do your own closure on the main actors of the book. A fun read
