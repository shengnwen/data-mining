The "Bible" is both readable and immediately useful.  The marketing information is specific and applicable.  I was surprised that Mr. Trottier could get so much helpful information into this book.  Not a paragraph is wasted.  Besides the marketing information, I found the section on fears and blocks extremely helpful.  I have since broken through and can hardly wait to complete my marketing plan for my career, as described at the end of the book.  The Freelance Writers Bible is a true inpsiration, and Mr. Trottier is a true mentor
