This book is an addictive, read-deep-into-the-night page-turner.  Whereas in Hyperion, I could stop after each tale for a bit, I couldn't put this book down.  I needed to know what happened next.  And next.  And next.  A phenominal epic that will remain with me forever.  Warning: read Hyperion first
