I've always enjoyed books about family and everyday life. I feel books that can convey a sense of reality to a reader hold far more importance and reach a depth that any other book could ever wish for. Enter "The Accidental Tourist" by Anne Tyler. 

I read this book during a dry spell in life when I was fed up with life and finding my life too ordered and predictable. I know you may be thinking "well, what's wrong with that". I felt a need for something more. That's when I met Macon Leary. Macon is a travel writer who pens book for the accidental tourist. An accidental tourist could best be defined as a travel minimalist. They exclude almost every chance at fun and try to make sure their comfort zone goes with them on a trip. He or she orders his or her  life and never takes a chance for fear of it being far too risky. Beginning to sound familiar???

With his life and marriage reaching the end, due mainly to the death of his young son, Macon meets Muriel Pritchett. She is his opposite in every way, but for some reason he can't stop the attraction. I won't give much more away but know that this is ultimately a love story. But, it is not the typical fall head over heels kind. It shows Macon making real choices in a real world based on very certain and uncertain consequences. At the end you may say what a fool or you may stand and applaud. I won't let out which way I went.

I'm sure you will enjoy this journey by a master story teller like Anne Tyler. The novel combines humor, family, life, death, love and choice in a way like no other. I hope you enjoy!
