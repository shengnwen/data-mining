I found this Bible very understandable. I have owned this Bible for several years for school because it is much less confusing than most other Bible's. It is translated very well into today's terms which make it very easy to read and understand. The stories are very clear and accurate. Before I rarely ever read the Bible, but now with The Good News Bible I read it much more often. This is a great Bible, especially for younger children who have a hard time reading and understanding other Bible's
