Dr. Callaghan's work over the past 15 years has been instrumental in developing microscopic applications of NMR imaging.  In this text, he expands on the seminal papers that he has published in the field and brings them together into a coherent whole.  The veiwpoint of the book is that of a physicist with a powerful tool looking at physical and biological problems.  Of the many texts on MR imaging I believe Dr Callaghan's description of MR physics to be most clear and complete.  This book is recommened for physicists and engineers interested in NMR microscopy of course.  However I would go on and recommend it for any serious student of MRI wanting a single volume that has a clear description of the fundamental phenomena at work in forming their images
