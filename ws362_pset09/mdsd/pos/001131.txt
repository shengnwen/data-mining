"Declare" is one of the greatest espionage novels in the latter half of the twentieth century - the American century, the only American century there will ever be.  It is disguised as a horror novel or a dark fantasy but every word in it is true.  Mr. Powers transcends mere art in his depiction of two souls caught up in events to powerful for them.  Its a book about how love endures all things, how our puny human choices matter even in the face of total darkness, and how (as T. S. Eliot put it) human beings can bear very little reality.

A keen and intelligent spirituality flickers like swamp fires through out "Declare". Mr. Powers says much and he knows far more than he's saying.  There were moments when I read this little masterpiece and chills ran up and down my spine.  Powers unveils the subterfuges of the human heart as it encounters sheer human malice and stupidity and beyond all of that something quintessentially non-human and terrifying because that something choses not to emphathize with us.

Perceptive readers will see into the heart of what Tim Powers is really getting at and it will give them shivers as they struggle through the meaningful but compensatory action sequences
