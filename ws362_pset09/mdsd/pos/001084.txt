I have been practicing Wicca for a few years and have been witness to the recent jump in popularity of the occult and consequently the jump in junk that's available for occult work. I think this book is a very good start for anyone interested in occult work, it gives an outline of Wicca in a good informative way and warns of many dangers overlooked by most beginners. However if you are experienced in the occult the book is a little elementary and you might consider something a little more in depth. But for a beginner I haven't found a better book
