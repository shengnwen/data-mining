Dr. Gray is an inspiration to any couple having intimacy issues.  From a female perspective it is amazing that he has captured the essence of what a female truly needs from her partner and has put it into words that our partners can understand.  Also from a female perspective, it is a relief to be able to hear what a man needs and get a translation of it into real loving terms that I can relate to.  Just because a man wants sex, doesn't mean that it is not related to him loving me.  This book is fantastic
