The courts ruled that the government can seize your land and give it to another individual for more tax dollars.

We do nothing.

The courts said that any pain in an execution is "cruel and unusual punishment" regardless of how dangerous or depraved the individual is.

We do nothing.

The courts said that terrorists have the same rights as American citizens.

We do nothing.

The courts invent laws like the "right to privacy", invented the Maranda warning, give illogical search rules for evidence, and have sactioned the US goverment in the violation of both expo-facto laws and double prosecution.  

We do nothing.

We have a dreadful court system.  While it's illegal to do violence against the court it's not illegal to start telling your children and your friends that anybody who joins the military to defend the courts is not only misguided, but they are helping the very people who are worthy of no protection.  Why defend people who are working towards your enslavement or physical destruction.

Ginsberg is a former lawyer for the ACLU.  She is the enemy.  If Islamic terrorists wanted to attack her home then the US military should take a coffee break that day.  Her protection is worth no blood of our children.

Few of the judges of our federal benches are worth our children's blood.  These are elites.  They are the enemy of good and normal Americans.

Read this book and you'll be convinced that if Ruth "Buzzy" Ginsburg was being attacked by a rabid dog that the only thing you should do is walk away from her possible aid fast.

God curse the American Supreme Court.  May they all meet unpleasant ends.  May their families pay for their sins in the most miserable ways
