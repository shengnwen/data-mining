The Cambridge Companion to Husserl contains essays by  various  Husserl scholars who attempt to show the relevance of Husserl's ideas to many recent issues in philosophy.  Barbosa says that I seem to ignore Husserl's ideas of categorial intuition and categorial abstraction and to characterize Husserlian mathematical epistemology in terms of detecting invariants in the flow of experience.  Evidently Barbosa did not read the paper very carefully.  Footnote 17 gives some examples of places to look in Husserl's writings for the view that ideal objects (including mathematical objects) are to be understood as invariants through the variations in our cognitive acts and processes.  Many more citations to Husserl's works could be added to this footnote.  In my paper I do not use the terms 'categorial intuition' and 'categorial abstraction'.  So I am guilty of not using these terms but I am not guilty of failing to discuss the ideas of intuition and abstraction in mathematics.  There are many technical Husserlian terms that I do not use in the paper.  I do use the terms 'intuition' and 'abstraction'.  In places where I use these terms and describe Husserl's views on mathematical intuition and the abstractions, idealizations and formalizations involved in mathematics, I also cite Husserl's texts on categorial intuition and categorial abstraction.  An attentive reviewer would only need to see footnotes 16, 19 and 24.  Open Husserl's Logical Investigations, for example, to sections 40-58 and read the Chapter title:  Sensuous and Categorial Intuitions
