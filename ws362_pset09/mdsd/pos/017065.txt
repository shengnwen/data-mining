The books are very well done, pictures and timelines inclusive but are targetting younger readers.  As an adult I must admit MOST of the content were things I did not know but thats more of a review of our schools than this book.
For your 10-12 year old age group they are the best. For adults they are interesting and beautifully pictured but brief.  Im glad I bought them but I wish my expectations had been set as to how short they are
