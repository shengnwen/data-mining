A challenging aspect with absorbing great literature plays is to find out why the title was named so, whether the title is hidden metaphorically or literally visible.   The title for Miller's first successful play, and not as well-knows as Death of a Salesman, derives from a line "they were all my sons", when the main character, Joe Keller, refers to the twenty-one P40 pilots killed because his company knowingly shipped out cracked cylinder heads.   

Although sent to prison for 14 months, he was exonerated, because he shifted the blame to his worker, Herb Deever, who still sits in prison.   

The emotional drama is lengthy and considered in the book series Best American Plays from 1945-1951 edited by John Gassner.  The themes run gamut from family, employment, greed, betrayal, denial, lies, anguish and most of all, responsibility.  The plot evolves, a twist here, and a  turn there!  Pain, sorrow and confusion permeate the mood.  And like Miller's plays, there are lengthy emotional monologues.  

Set in the back yard of a home in an American town, it takes place in one long night and it opens with family keeps remarking on the tree planted for their 27 year-old son Larry, missing-in-action  for 2 years, and some presume him dead.  The broken tree keeps popping up throughout conversations as it is symbolic of the demise of the family.  

The night the tree breaks, the chain of action begins.  Larry's girlfriend Anne is expected to come back to town, but now, she is about to marry Chris Keller, the other brother.  The tension & conflict arises because, once childhood neighbors to the Kellers, Anne and her brother, George, now an attorney, are the children of the man, Herb Deever, the one who was forced to take the blame for the death of twenty-one pilots.  

Like most plays, they are always better than the movie versions, (if any).  If you see an exact play performed, then it is worth it. ......But the books are always better....MzRizz
