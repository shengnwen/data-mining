Hope Mirrlees originally published this marvelous book back in the 1920s, to some acclaim at the time.  The book then was forgotten by all except a few lovers of fantasy until it was republished by the now legendary "sign of the unicorn" series put out by Ballentine in the 1960s and early 70s.  Many authors have tried, with varying degrees of success, to achieve what Mirrlees does so effortlessly:  She brings a true sense of the mystery and wonder to this story of a people who live on the borders of fairlyland.  In this book, we learn about Nathaniel Chanticleer and his son.  About a people who would rather not see fairyland, but who are in some ways inextricably linked.  I don't want to say too much, or give too much away about this wondrous story, but I would like to say that one phrase has stuck with me for a long time:  One character accidentally wears yellow to a funeral, and then comments that it was, "after all, a blackish sort of yellow."  True words of the genuine synesthete, yes; but also true words of those who have touched the fe.  I am just delighted that this is back in print.  I hope everyone reads and enjoys it!
