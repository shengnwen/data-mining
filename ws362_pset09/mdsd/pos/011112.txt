I originally bought this book as a novelty cookbook, thinking that it it would just be fun to know how they make 'secret sauce' and a few other cool things.  However, once I cracked this book open, I read it from cover to cover!  I never read a cookbook all the way through before.

The book has tons of trivial and fun info on restaurant history and how most of these chain restaurants started.  I've made about a dozen of the recipes so far and they really are just like the restaurants make!  I made the Walkabout Soup from Outback restaurant as an appetizer while I was entertaining the other day.  The soup is the best that I ever had and certainly the best that I have ever made.  And, last week I made the pizza sticks from Applebees and loved them so much I'm making them again tomorrow.

Helpful info:  Don't use Hunt's tomatoe sauce for any recipes (way too salty--ruins the whole recipe).  
Also, follow the recipes to the letter.  Even if the recipes only call for 1/8 tsp. of something, you'll find that little ingrediant makes or breaks the whole dish
Have fun
