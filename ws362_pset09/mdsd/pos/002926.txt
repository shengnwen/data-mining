Don't Retire, Rewire! is a practical book that can help you make the transition from a job you currently have to one that provides more satisfaction at many levels. Why would you want to do that? The most obvious reason is that you are expected to retire from your present job. But you might be looking for a new life because of job dissatisfaction or because you've been laid off. Alternatively, you may want more space in your life for things that you'd like to do like volunteering or creating a new artistic life. The reasons are many and this book provides a stepping stone to get you there.
The book provides concrete steps to perform self-analysis. The authors walk you clearly through the process and follow the progress of four different pre-retirees. Examples are a great way to truly understand complex concepts and the authors do a solid job. If you are unclear on "what's next," this is a good book to add to your bookshelf.
And if you are still stuck, hire a retirement coach, career coach or consultant to get you unstuck
