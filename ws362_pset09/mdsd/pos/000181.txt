Paul Woodruff may have written one of the more important books I have ever read.  At this time of near war and religious terror, with our country, and the world, being rapidly torn apart by political and sectarian certainties, Woodruff's book is as welcome as a breath of clean, gas free air might have been on the night of the Bhopal catastrophe.  If I could afford it, and if I thought they would read it, I would send a copy to every politician and religious leader in the world.  In the past 20 of the almost 68 years of my life, I have read many works of moral philosophy and ethics.  Reverence has been one of the very few truly awe inspiring books I've ever read.  And the remarkable thing about Reverence is that it can speak to almost any one, of whatever religious or political persuasion, or to those with none.  It is written in such a manner as to be accessible to readers of almost any level above, say, the seventh grade, and speaks with comparable interest to those whose lives may have been devoted to a study of moral philosophy.  According to Woodruff, while reverence may certainly be involved in religion, and in fact, religion without true reverence is one of the most distructive forces in the world, it should be embraced even more closely by the politician and the great leaders of the world, as well as us ordinary mortals.  If you don't read anything else in the year 2003, read Reverence. William F Harriso
