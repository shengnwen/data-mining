I purchased this book for my 4 and a half-year-old son, which is now fascinated by all things Titanic. I felt the tragic nature of the story; the excessive text of most books and the content of the movies were not suitable for kids.  When I found this book I knew it would be just right for a him. 

The size of the book was the first thing that amazed my son. Then he was impressed with the dominant artwork inside.  Marschall's illustrations are simply wonderful.  He's indeed a great artist and an expert when it comes to the Titanic.  The book illustrates the great ship, its interiors and it's ultimate demise as it follows the story of two real-life children that were aboard the Titanic on her maiden voyage.  

My son was so excited after we finished the book that he insisted to take it to school where his teacher had a reading for the whole class
