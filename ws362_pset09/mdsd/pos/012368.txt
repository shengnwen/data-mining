This installment, like the rest of this series so far, is suspenseful, funny and populated with characters that seem very real.  One new character, Laura Fielding, is admirably faithful to her imprisoned husband, and is, in general, a very likable character (and one that charms both Stephen and Jack).  The Middle Eastern setting of this book is exotic and very vividly described.  Stephen's adventures in his new scientific marvel, the diving bell, are both funny and interesting.  Jack's encounters with Laura's massive dog Ponto are hilarious.  The end of this book is very suspenseful because the reader has come to really care about the characters involved.  The most notable thing about this book is what a great job O'Brian did of keeping this series fresh by bringing in new locations, characters and situations.  O'brian did a great job of not letting this series fall into predictable formulas and repetition.  The only failing of this book is that the very end is just a little disappointing and O'brian leaves the reader hanging much more than in the previous books
