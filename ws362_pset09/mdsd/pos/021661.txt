I have read all but the last 2 books in this series (and those are sitting on my shelf), and ever single entry is excellent and intelligently written.  Cuddy is honorable, tough and smart (although a bit too sanctimonious) and  the other characters are always vivid and believable.  The mystery here is  first-rate; I was shaking my head in amazement after all the pieces came  together.  Healy deserves to be a lot better known and successful
