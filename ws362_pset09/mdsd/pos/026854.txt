I purchased this book because my maiden name is Chester- honestly, it's the only reason I got it! What a delight to find that the story is amusing and worth every penny. Chester is a mouse who does things his own way- he always eats the same thing for breakfast, he always uses hand signals when he rides his bike, and he never leaves the house without double-knotting his shoelaces. Chester's best friend's name is Wilson (my mother's maiden name- another delightful surprise!), and he and Chester are inseperable. When Wilson accidentally swallows a watermelon seed and cries because he's afraid he'll grow a watermelon in his belly, Chester swallows one too, so Wilson won't be alone in his predicament. This pair are like two peas in a pod...and then Lilly moves into the neighborhood. Lilly has HER own way of doing things, and Chester and Wilson avoid her like the plague. That is, until she scares of some neighborhood bullies trying to pick on Wilson and Chester. From then on, the three of them go everywhere together, and Chester and Wilson find that Lilly has many of the same interests that they do. An amusing and chuckle-out-loud story for all. Be sure to get &quot;Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse&quot;, too
