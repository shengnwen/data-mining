This is a great book.  John Robbins starts with one farm animal at a time and tells how that animal is sentient, can be characterized with what we might call human qualities, and then tells how that animal is treated on the factory farm.  Each chapter begins with a quote you can use to further your campaign against factory farming.

The middle section is about the environment and the impacts the factory farm has on the environment.  This is useful to sway those who think they are saving the world as environmentalists, without concern for the "humanity" of animals.

The final section covers the nutritional aspects of a vegan diet.  

I believe Robbins is a beacon of light in animal welfare.  He might not achieve the vegan ideal, but I think he is definitely worth a look, and for those who are new to the movement, the words he writes are earth shaking.  The only thing, the factory farm has unfortunately become even more brutal for animals, workers, environment, and our health since this book has been written
