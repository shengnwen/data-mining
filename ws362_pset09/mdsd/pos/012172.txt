Like said before, this book is for already established fans of J.R.R. Tolkien.  This book includes an essay about fairy stories and Tolkien's thoughts about what a fairy story is and is not.  It was a slow read, but interesting to see into his mind and to discover his influences.  The highlight of the book for me was the Farmer Giles of Ham.  It was a well told story.  The adventures of Tom Bombadil were good because it gives you some backstory of Tom.  I'm not really a fan of Tom Bombadil, but you can appreciate the thought that Tolkien put into Bombadils poetry/stories.  I really believe Bombadil was one of Tolkiens favorite characters
