I actually went out just to get Building a bridge to the 18th century but that was in hardcover so i decided to just get a paperback of this .. i've read all his 80's and 90's works and like the previous reviewer said.. it  is just a compressed version of his later works.. it's actually easier to  read since he doesn't go into his frequent bit of going back a couple  centuries and talk about when print was just introduced as in his other  books..  Anyways, a good read.. Yes this was helpful
