Crusader's Cross is in the mystery, adventure, action genre and I consider James Lee Burke the finest proponent of this type of
fiction writing today.  Burke's understanding of how the human
mind functions (and malfunctions) is extraordinary and has never,in my opinion, been better displayed than in Crusader's
Cross.  I think I have read all his books - certainly all his
Dave Robicheaux novels - and he just seems to get better and better.  Thank you Mr. Burke.  You have expanded my thinking,
made me laugh, and entertained me thoroughly. Who could possibly resist a series where one of the family pets is a 3-legged racoon named Tripod
