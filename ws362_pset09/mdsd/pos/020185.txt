DNA for Cultural Cues to Effectively Reach Blacks

As a black moderator I am often asked how black perspectives differ from other ethnic groups.  Pepper Miller and Herb Kemp in What's Black About It? both affirm and enlighten me on key cultural cues.  They illuminate the black experience while highlighting the best practices needed to succeed in marketing to African Americans.  From the importance of brands to blacks' relationship with time (which has been elevated from `CP Time' to Kairos Time) they provide a DNA map of insights to help you capture your share of a changing African-American market.
