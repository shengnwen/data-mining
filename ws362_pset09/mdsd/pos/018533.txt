I have just finished this series and the only bad thing that I have to say about it is that I have just finished this series.  Oh, I wish it weren't over!

Plenty has been written about the characters, plots, etc., so I just want to say that I'm a "chick" and I loved this series, and I also want to add comments from a parent's perspective.

I finally got around to seeing the movie about a year and a half ago and immediately went on the internet to find out more.  I felt that the movie was suitable for my elementary-aged children (with supervision), and tried to find out whether the books would also be okay as most of my reading is done via audio books with my children in the car (I've become a big fan of classical literature, so they are used to hearing books that are above their reading level).

Unfortunately for my children, while the adult themes in the movie will go over their heads and I will let them watch it, the adult themes in the books will not (so they don't get to read the books yet).  There is strong profanity, extreme drunkenness, prostitution, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, and rather straightforward talk about sex.  None of it is gratuitous or unnecessarily graphic, but it is too much for children.   I'm guessing 16 is probably the youngest at which I would be comfortable with them reading this series, but that is only a guess as my children have a way to go before then
