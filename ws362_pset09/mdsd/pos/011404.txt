An oblique, perverse novel, &quot;The Name of the World&quot; strains credibility in its attempts to defy reader expectations--Johnson is not one to allow Event B to follow Event A; he'd rather throw in Event Z out of the blue, just for the heck of it--but the end result is nonetheless a strong, memorable, affecting book.  It is not a &quot;well-made&quot; novel, though, and it may help to recall the willful craziness of &quot;Jesus' Son,&quot; which made similar demands on the reader.  Where the earlier book was a collection of interrelated stories, &quot;The Name of the World&quot; is one long first-person narrative, devoid of chapter breaks, which meanders all over the map--the basic strategy is more or less the same, though.  It's a &quot;mess,&quot; but I'm certain the mess is deliberate, and the narrative is hypnotically effective.  Far from a failure, it strikes me as a book by a very confident writer at the top of his game
