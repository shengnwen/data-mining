This is agreat book for anyone who has a good understanding of behavioral psychology.  If you do, this book will help explain the concepts employed by psychologists today.  It also gives the reader a good feel for the attitudes that prevailed in psychology in the 1950's.  If you do not have a  strong background in this area,  I would suggest reading one of Skinner's  later books first
