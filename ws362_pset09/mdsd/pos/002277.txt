Kids love it.  This is a consistent 'go to' for my my infant daughter, and we enjoy reading it to her too.  Big, bright, and imaginative pictures and a warm little poem.  The premise is simple: a child imagines that he/she has all of the superlative attributes of several different animals ('quick as a cricket').  I don't know if this is considered a classic (yet), but I think it's a must for the kids' shelves
