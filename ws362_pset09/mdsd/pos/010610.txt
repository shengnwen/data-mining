Of all the groups in American history, the Puritans still have the biggest bum rap of them all.  H.L. Mencken articulated this false view perfectly when he defined a Puritan as someone who laid awake at night, fretting that  somebody, somewhere, was having a good time.  While the Puritans did have  strong beliefs over the appropriateness of certain entertainments (such as  the theater, which they banned as a place of lies and the breeding ground  of crime), they did believe that God intended there to be joy in life as  well.  One of their greatest joys was sex: so long as it was within  marriage, the Puritans believed sex was necessary, wonderful, and to be  practiced often.  Indeed, when one man refused to have sex with his wife,  he was excommunicated from the Church!  Bruce Daniels' much-needed volume  on leisure and recreation in colonial New England fills up a hole in our  historical awareness of this intense group.  I loved this book, almost as  much as I loved Edmund Morgan's book, &quot;The Puritan Family.&quot;  This  one is not to be missed by history buffs
