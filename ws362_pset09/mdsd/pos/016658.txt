This book has helped one little boy become a very good big brother and I have since given another copy to another little boy to help him prepare for his baby sister arriving in a few months.  Both little boys enjoy this book and often request it at bedtime.  It talks about how Big Brothers get to do different things than babies (like eating ice cream and pizza) and that Big Brothers are very special and are loved by mommy and daddy very much
