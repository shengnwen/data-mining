I have, for over 20 years, followed the career of Sandi Patty (even when her last name was spelled Patti!) and loved hearing in her own words this book.  Sandi has always made her audience feel connected and she more than succeeds again!

The trying times of her life were shared in honest details and in a way that wasn't "poor me".  I love Sandi Patty and recommend this book for anyone on the back row of life
