This book is more concentrated on diffusers than absorbers, with extensive care on Schroeder diffusers. Also it is more concentrated on acoustical physics than the discussion on various acoustic materials.

Some peoples (like me) may find the chapter "Measurement of Absorber properties" exceptionally useful.

To illustrate my point: you cannot find the terms "anechoic chamber" in the index.
