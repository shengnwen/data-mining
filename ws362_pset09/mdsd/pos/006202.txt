Briefly the premise of the book is the first 20 years in the life of Henry Star growing up in poverty in the troubled Ireland in the early part of the 20th century.  Henry is a hard man and becomes involved in the troubles, eventually to be consumed by them.

You do not need any expertise in this period of history to understand or enjoy the book.  In fact, unless you are very knowledgeable, you will probably learn a few truths.  The only thing you need to know is that the English colonised Ireland for centuries and the Irish Republicans were determined to throw them out.

I highly recommend this book to any one who is interested in character novels with an historical bent.  I am now looking forward to the sequel which Doyle is currently working on
