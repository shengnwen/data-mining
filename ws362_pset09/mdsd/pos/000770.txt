I have been blessed to live in New England and to study witchcraft with Christopher Penczak. So far, I'm about 2 levels ahead of his publishing schedule. If not, I might be tempted to jump ahead on my own. His writing is that good.

My first Wicca book was fine, written by a highly-respected elder, but it didn't answer my questions, especially about WHY we do things in a particular way.

Mr. Penczak's books read exactly as though you are sitting in his class. This is the real plus for readers: You get all the background information that would normally be discussed in the class setting. Not many authors can anticipate reader's questions, but with his vast teaching experience, Mr. Penczak knows what else you're going to want to know.

When I was first exploring the Path, I believed I only needed the spiritual work that is so carefully laid out in the Inner Temple book. Until I tried spellwork with amazing results. Now this is the one book on my shelf that I find myself returning to time and again.

You will enjoy reading and referring to The Outer Temple for years to come.
