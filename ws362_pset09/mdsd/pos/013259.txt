George Weigel is the preeminent Catholic author in America today, and would be my vote for Vatican Press Secretary. However, I bought this book to gain deeper insight into Benedict XVI, and find it has much more to do with the end of John Paul II's life and his legacy. It isn't until halfway through the book when the conclave is covered. This book is in reality a sequel to Weigel's monumental biography of John Paul II - not that there's anything wrong with that.  Well written, with Mr. Weigel's usual great attention to accurate detail, this book sets the table for an earnest biography of Benedict XVI. If he writes it, George will undoubtedly earn a full five stars
