Hello everyone. I put Sieze the Night down about five minutes ago. The book is quite a good read for fans of the author, or of the first book, Fear Nothing. The characters are great, very easy to come to love. 

The plot line is much better in the second book, elaborating on many aspects of the first installment. I found it hard to put down.

However, the ending left room for another book. I began my search for the elusive third Christopher Snow book and have found nothing conclusive. Please.if any of you fans know if there really is, or will be a third book, let me know. I have started a discussion below, I would very much appreciate any helpful information
