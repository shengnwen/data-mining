Miz Peck is quite a talented authoress. Surprises me that she ever went the self-publish route at all as the quality of the writing is well above average. The cat pieces and the poetry were not my thing, but I skipped over them and felt I did not miss out for having done so. My favorite piece was the cell phone story.
My "quibbles" concern her brothers. Perhaps being a male reader accounts for it, but she came off as overly-dismissive of them. It is explained that they are significantly younger, making sibling "bonding" difficult. I was able to take that into consideration. At one point she states that being boys they didn't count (or words to that effect). If that was meant to be flippant, it didn't work for me. I was left with the impression that there are unresolved "issues" there, which detracted from the easy-going tone elsewhere.
Related, but pickier still, was the use of the term "girlchild" - by someone who clearly pokes fun at the use of "womyn" at the festival. Is "daughter" such an awful word? Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think I should be left wondering about it
