As someone eagerly awaiting the arrival of her first adopted child, I found this a very valuable book, not because it was packed full of practical hints and useful suggestions, but because it described the kinds  of problems, issues and feelings that any adoptive parent has. I think the  fact that one of the authors was a single mother like myself made it even  more relevant for me. If you are feeling bogged down the facts,  forms and  processes involved in adopting, this is the book to pick up and address  some of those pent up emotions. It is also the encouragement you may need,  from someone who knows what it's really like, that YOU CAN DO IT despite  seemingly long odds
