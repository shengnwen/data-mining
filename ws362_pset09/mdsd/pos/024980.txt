Like others I contend that this book is far in a way the very best of all the retellings of the events on Ruby Ridge percisely because of the way the author decided to present the material.

The background data is nearly perfect providing just enough information to the reader while never hindering the flow of the story.  The Weaver family come off at the same time as nice folk but terrible misguided, ill informed, and increasingly responsible for the self-fulfilling prophecies of destruction.
The seem so sympathetic that the reader almost feels pity for them because it is their ill founded fears and feeling based, unreasoning conviction in their own delusions that bring on the very things they fear.  I related to the jury foreman(Jake Weaver - no relation to Randy) who said, "If I could have convicted him(Randy Weaver) for gross stupidity I would have."

However, compaired to the government blunders the Weavers look fantastic.  The FBI is especially bad, not so much the agents as the leadership.  The whole government response from the very first is overblown, fraught with worry, conspiracy thinking, and made things markedly worse than they already were and digresses into terrible infighting and intr-agency sniping while everyone fears liabiliy from the whole mis-handled affair.  

The trial was excellent and a nearly perfect demonstration of how our criminal court system works trying to protect rights but often having to walk a tightrope on evidence and testimony, not to mention attorney behavior.

It this book is not the truth of what happened it is as close as we are ever likely to get.  I highly recomend it without reservation other than warning the unsuspecting that in truthfully presenting the story there are occasional bits of colorful language, and some very distasteful and unbecoming verbalized racism of the worst sort and that I personally had hoped we as a nation had left far in our past
