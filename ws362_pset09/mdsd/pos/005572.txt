In his other books, Butch Harmon writes a great deal about his father, as well as the Harmons' relationships with the greatest golfers of the mid-20th century. Here, we get much more than simply another family history. Rather, we get a son's perspective on his father, who was both parent and teacher to him.

That said, this is, after all, the story of a golf club pro, and one of only a handfull in the modern age of golf to have one a major championship. While we get a great deal of history, the main focus is on how Claude Harmon Sr. taught both his sons and his pupils, as well as how those lessons have been passed down the line. There is also a fair amount of perspective on Butch Harmon's relationship with Tiger Woods, then and now. As a bonus, we get yet a rare perspective on Ben Hogan, who was a family friend to the Harmons.

This book can be read as either history or as an essay on teaching the game. However it is read, most golf fans will enjoy the tales herein
