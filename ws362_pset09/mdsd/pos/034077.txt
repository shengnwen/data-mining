This is a lovely book--What inspired me about Jonathan's observations was that they brought home the reality that those whom we send to war take all their human passions and loves with them.  Too often we think of soldiers as 'just' soldiers--and this book reminds us how wrong we are when we do that. The author's journal entries show us a world full of nature's resilience, and we don't only learn about the birds of Iraq, we see another side of a soldier's life overseas. I'd highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in birding, or who wants a view of Iraq that is different from what we see on the nightly news. And for anyone who needs a healthy dose of inspiration, this is a great read too--when was the last time you read something about Iraq that made you hopeful?
And you can't beat the price--I'm buying a couple copies as gifts for friends, and definitely one for my dad for Father's Day
