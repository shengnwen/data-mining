This King James Study Bible is excellent. There is a lot of history about who wrote each book, an outline at the beginning of each book to help find scripture and a breakdown of scripture when necessary.

I have come back to the Lord and this Bible has helped me greatly in my daily Bible study.  It is my opinion that the KJV bible is the true words of the Lord.

I highly recommend this Bible to others seeking the Word of God
