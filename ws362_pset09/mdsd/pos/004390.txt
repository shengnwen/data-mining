I am new to bee keeping, my first hive didn't make it through Ohio's winter, when I picked up a new package to repopulate the hive, the owner of the apiary, Queens Right Colonies, recommended this book.  Each time I get into my hive I look through the book to learn what I have seen. Has been very helpful. Great book!
