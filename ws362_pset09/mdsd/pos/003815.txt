Almost immediately after the Alamo fell March 6, 1836, it became shrouded in so many myths that there's still some that people hold firm beliefs in today. Naturally, the majority of the myths and legends surround the three main personalities: David Crockett, Jim Bowie, and William Barret Travis.

This book attempts to strip away all of the folklore that has become virtually synonymous with these three. Their lives are laid bare, showing the common reader that they were human, after all. The legendary Crockett had political troubles, Bowie was notorious for dealing heavily in land swindles and slavery, and Travis was pretty much a failure at everything before packing up and moving to Texas (unfortunately, leaving his family behind him in Alabama). Despite showing their flaws and shortcomings, however, the author does not attempt to undermine their brave stand at the Alamo. He maintains that they fought for what they believed in, and that makes them admirable.

This book is unique in that it is, essentially, a triple biography. There is not one complete section for each of the three subjects; rather, the book is written so that the chapters alternate between each of them. This provides the reader with a sense of where the other two were and what they were doing while maintaining a primary focus on the third. While it is quite a hefty tome, it is at the same time quite readable and enjoyable to boot. Davis clearly has done his homework and hopefully this will become one of the quintessential books on the Alamo
