Well written and a must read if you want to read about Princess Diana, the person. He doesn't make her out to be bigger than life. The author seems unbiased because he writes about her faults as well as her assets. Enjoyed Paul's sons remembrances of fun times with Diana, William and Harry.
I loved the photos of Diana's apt. in Kensington Palace. It is too bad the royal family couldn't keep some of the rooms in tact as they did with Princess Margaret
