This is an excellent biography, covering Washington's entire life in a single volume. Its 'readablity' is fairly high for a history book. It is considerably less dry than your average text book, but a bit less readable than a historian with more mass appeal like Ellis. All good history books have a balance between 'fact' and interpretation, and in this one Flexner tends to keep the scales tipped a bit toward the factual side. This is great for gaining a solid understanding of what happened in Washington's life, but it does render a work a bit less readable than your typical airplane novel. 

Flexner obviously has a pro-Washington bias. You can tell he respects and admires the father of our country. If you are looking for a book that will give you all the "dirt" on Washington's flaws, this is not that book. My personal opinion is that it would be hard to understand George Washington in light of his time and place, and not come away with a great deal of respect and admiration for his character. However, I understand there are some iconoclasts out there who prefer history to be a bit less kind to powerful dead white men. They probably won't be too thrilled with this book. 

All in all, this is an excellent work, which will give any reader helpful insights into the life of perhaps the greatest American that ever lived.
