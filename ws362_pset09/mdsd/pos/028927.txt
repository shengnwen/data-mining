Dr. Goodwin was given what few biographers, certainly presidential ones, rarely are: access.  Both working in the Johnson Administration and working with LBJ in his later years on his memoirs she had numerous conversations with this highly controversial politician.   She gives a balanced reveiw, especially given that her closeness early on in her career.

I found the book to be quite good and educational but very short of  the other, more recent biographies that have done so well on Washington, Lincoln, Adams, and Jefferson.  While Dr. Goodwin's credentials are beyond reproach, perhaps her writing in terms of narrative style, has imporved quite a bit from this book, written some thirty years ago.  Do not misunderstand, it is well worth reading but it is not in the same league with "No Ordinary Time" or "Team of Rivals" - two great works of hers.

Two Chapters that are must reads are "The Great Society" and "Vietnam".  Both give terrific insight into LBJ's mind when one looks back on the certain failures of the latter and many of the former and asks "what was the administration thinking?".  Many questions to these can be found in those two tightly written chapters.

A book worth reading but certainly not "The" book on LBJ the way David Herbert Donald's was with "Lincoln".
