 "The Corrections" ,although often times comedic, is a discourse on the tragic emptiness of modern life.  We see an ordinary family dealing with the situation which modern society has handed them, that is, the renouncement of all social traditions and the emphasizing of the individual's sense of pain and pleasure as the measure of all morality.  What we see are not morally awakened individuals, but rather, a collection of confused young people who have no moral basis for denying themselves pleasure for the happiness of another human being, in particular, their elderly sick parents.  I have a great interest in the moral collapse of modern society.  I discuss this topic at my website http://moralvacuum.blogspot.com   

Although I found this book to be very well written (but occasionally pretentious) and to contain several powerful messages, I did not see where the conclusion explained how the fate of the principal characters corrected their lives.  The author implied that such was the case but I don't think he resolved in his own mind how they could be redeemed.  His power lies in his ability to describe their desperation not their successes.
