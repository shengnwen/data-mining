Maugham's fictionalized biography of French Impressionist
Paul Gaughin presents a stark attempt to recreate the bizarre life of this amoral painter.  Despite the action-less first two chapters (which seem to lead nowhere) this riveting novel dares portray the protagonist as an Englishman; the passive narrator attempts to reconstruct the history of a genius who remained unrecognized in his long-suffering lifetime.  Shocked by the callous way this "unmitigated cad" treats his devoted, law-abiding wife, the narrator is both nauseated and appalled by Strickland's flagrant disregard for social proprieties-even to repaying the most generous hospitality with crass betrayal.  Yet the unnamed narrator is gradually, reluctantly, drawn into a web of admiration for the passion of the iconoclastic Artist, who seems possessed by demons in his search for the ideal of Beauty.

     Slowly but inexorably readers are introduced to the private actions and misanthropic attitude of an artist-in-training, one
Charles Strickland.  Related by a decent observer/narrator the novel retraces the violent birth of genius: from his sudden inexplicable desertion of his wife, his flight to a meager garret in Paris; there the former stockbroker sacrifices all to learn a new, soul-driven craft.  Long after Strtickland's death of Leprosy in Tahiti, the narrator interviews various persons who knew and/or loved him, thus piecing together a posthumous biographical patchwork of the tortured painter.  Regardless of Maugham's adherence to (or deviation from) strict biographical detail, this novel mesmerizes readers as it spotlights the tormented life of a man who insists on metamorphosing into true Genius by sheer will power.  The character of Strickland, 
condemned as shameless and scandalous by polite Society, will fascinate generations of readers who appreciate the passion of a literary artist who proves Gaughin's equal.  Judge him for yourself!
