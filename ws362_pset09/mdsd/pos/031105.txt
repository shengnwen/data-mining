Belize is a bird watcher's paradise.  I bought this book right before my first trip to Belize in June of 2006.  As an amateur bird watcher, I found it immensely easy to identify birds with this book as a guide.  It is somewhat hefty, and a little cumbersome to carry around in the steamy jungles, but its printed on high-quality paper with water-resistant paper boards, and well laid out for quick reference.  My wife and I stayed at two resorts during our trip, and all of the resident expert bird guides carried this book!  The plates are wonderfully hand drawn in color, which is much better than color photographs for any field guide. Another couple we met also had this book, but felt the drawings of some of the species were not on par with other publications, but obviously a volume dedicated to the single country you are in makes this volume well worth the price
