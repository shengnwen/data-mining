America's Test Kitchen Live is up to the franchise's usual standards.  If you are a fan of the PBS series you will want these faithfully produced scripts for the TV version. The recipes are well perfected to make sure the home chef can produce consistent mouth watering results for family and friends. If you have ever tweaked a recipe until you got it just right, you will love the approach of Chris Kimball and company.  They save the home cooking enthusiast a lot of time and energy by doing the tweaking for them. 

The products tested in this volume range from infomercial gadgets to common necessary kitchen tools used under a range of conditions. The pretty well detailed test results not only offer the best and worst culinary utensils in any category but a lot of the near misses along with their costs. In many ways the text version of these product exams are better than their video counter parts.

The Kitchen's taste tests cover a wide rang of products, many of which are available in most supermarkets. The same care that goes into product testing is apparent in their taste tests. 

The subscribers to the publisher's bi-monthly "Cooks Illustrated" magazine will be a little disappointed in this volume.  I found many of the recipes, product tests, and taste testes were previously available in that bi-monthly periodical on my shelf in much greater detail.  

If you want to skip all the gloss and are only interested in a few of the recipes, product test results, and taste test results outlined on the small screen then you would do best to log onto the America's Test Kitchen web page and download the few bits and pieces that peaked your interest.
