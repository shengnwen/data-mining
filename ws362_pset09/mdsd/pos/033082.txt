Here we have intrigue, adventure, excitement and even sex thrown into the book. Details are sparse, enough to interest and not to bore. 

Still, Dirk Pitt's lines are a bit too smooth and clever, the bad guy doesn't evolve enough(even though the good guys are constantly moving against him, he doesn't defend and secure his base) and the ending was quite silly. 

Yet, at least the action is good enough to make you want more.
