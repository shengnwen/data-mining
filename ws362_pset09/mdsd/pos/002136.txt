I've lived in Colorado all my life and two years ago, I started my experience with Colorado 14ers.  I may not be the most avid climber, but I do plan on climbing these amazing mountains for many years to come.  After my second mountain, I realized that I was going to need a way to keep track and better plan my future climbs and, being that I worked at a bookstore, I had a pretty good opportunity to look through many books on the subject.  I found this book to be by far the best guide of its type.  It gives all the information that a climber will need to climb every last fourteener and does so in a way that is enjoyable and easy to understand without giving away any of the thrills and experiences of the climb itself.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to climb even just one of these amazing mountains
