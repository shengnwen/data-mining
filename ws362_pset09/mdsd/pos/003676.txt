Code Talker, November 21, 2006- reviewer: Danae Sietsema 
I would recommend this book to people who have a military background. There are a lot of war references that people, who haven't had the background, wouldn't know. It's a very good book. It keeps the plot going and there is a new twist with every turn of the page. The main character over comes many struggles in his life. He was born a Navaho Indian, and is told that their way of life is worth nothing, and the only way to live is by the white's culture. He goes to a school to learn the white's language. He studies and works very hard, soon becoming fluent in both Navaho and English. Later in his life he's needed in the U.S. marines in order to save lives.
