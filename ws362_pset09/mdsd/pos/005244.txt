We bought this to use with our daughter this summer.  She had just finished third grade and I wanted to be sure that she was up-to-par before she started fourth grade.  The history portions were well written and easy for her to understand.  She enjoyed the poetry pieces especially.  I wouldn't rely on this soley, if I were homeschooling, but it does make a very helpful and handy tool for suplimenting a public school education
