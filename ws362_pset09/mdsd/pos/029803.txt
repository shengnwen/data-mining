This collection includes the stories Pancakes, The Nature of the Beast, King Vold, Heads, Goodbye Mister Tod, The Varcolac, The Right Hand of Doom, and Box Full of Evil.  There are also several pages of sketches at the end.  The artwork is awesome, and the stories are usually pretty good.  My favorites were Heads (Hellboy steps into a really freaky Japanese folktale) and Box Full of Evil, which is one of the longer stories of the bunch.  Pancakes, one of the shortest, was pretty cute.  This probably wasn't the best collection for a beginner like me to start with, but it wasn't bad.  The only thing I really missed was a better insight into the characters involved - other than the Hellboy movie, I have absolutely not experience with any of the Hellboy characters, and I'm starting find out how different the movie is from the comics
