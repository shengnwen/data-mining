and so do I. I have to read it over and over to her, if I put it down she cries and as soon as I pick it back up and start again she smiles. She has yet to understand the story, she just likes the pictures and the rythm. I found the one bad review of this book on this site bizarre. I enjoy the book and find the illustrations to be anything but "elementary". Hmmmm, different folks, different strokes. This book is at least worth a check out from the library (though everyone who tries it is bound to fall in love and have to buy it.
