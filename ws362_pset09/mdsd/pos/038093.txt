It is quite a long book but well worth it!  This book begins with the Ch'ing dynasty and traces the course of China's history up through Deng's reforms.  China's history is particulary difficult because it requires drawing on the events of so many other countries.  A historian of this subject must be able to survey the histories of these countries in order to relate them to events in China.  The author does an amazing job of delivering a solid history that is a good read
