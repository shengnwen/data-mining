Remember when you were a kid and first discovered the time machine-like power of a book to transport you to distant centuries and places?  Remember the hours you spent gloriously lost in its magical pages?  Well yes, you CAN go home again and will when you enter the world of Rafael Sabatini, a historical fiction writer's writer if ever there was one.

CAPTAIN BLOOD is old-school adventure with a modern sensibility.  By that I mean, Sabatini understands that romantic swashbuckling heroes must be realistic, too, and that his plot and fiction must be leavened with the truth of history for it to come off just right.  In reading this book, then, you will learn something about the useful role of piracy and buccaneering in the Caribbean during the 17th century.  No mere pawns on an oceanic chessboard, these pirates and privateers were players of substance in the war games and skirmishes between the nautical heavyweights of those days -- England, France, and Spain.

In addition to a completely engaging hero and a plot even short-attention spanned young readers can embrace, CAPTAIN BLOOD offers outstanding characterization and insight into mankind's cupidity, ambition, and thirst for power.  Sabatini shows the so-called "respectable"  nobles of the European countries to be every bit as bloodthirsty and criminal as the pirates they hunt down and despise, and CAPTAIN BLOOD is the perfect vehicle with which to do it.

If you haven't tried Sabatini, you're denying yourself.  This is the book!  Watch a common man of uncommon ability and charisma match wits and strength, guile and subterfuge, and words of love and hate with nefarious admirals, despicable villains, a bold and beautiful woman, and high-placed European snobs all in the accurately-rendered setting of the sunny Caribbean.  It'll make you feel young again (even if you're only 12), I promise
