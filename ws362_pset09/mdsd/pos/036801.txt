Soon I will celebrate my 84th birthday; I'm originally from NYC and lived in the West Bronx where I saw and heard Sol Alinsky speak at building cooperatives and other organizational events on various occasions. Sol Alinsky was NOT a Marxist and those who attribute this to him never saw or heard him when he was a young and very alive human being. He was an honest, sincere American patriot.

He lived in a shameful period of our history when Capitalism was at its worst; not too many years after the tragic, horrific Triangle fire which burned a large number of seamstresses to death in a dress factory. Since the truism that "history repeats itself" is occurring at this very moment, if I believed in reincarnation, I would search for Alinsky's return. Capitalism has returned to the days of old and there are very few companies which are good to their workers. 

Alinsky was the workers' knight in shining armor with a tongue that was greater and stronger than that of Sir Lancelot. If Hillary or any one else from that period learned anything from him, they were very fortunate for he was that unique voice of decency which appears all to infrequently.

For all those honest, good Americans who are appallled with the lies and deceptions of our present day leaders, this is a book which should be read to help, guide and invigorate you in the never-ending battle against religious fanaticism and ultra right-wing reactionary views. When a group argues for the teachings of the BIBLE as to Creation, we are in very deep trouble and the cultural switch has slipped into reverse.

No one wants to acknowledge that the so-called Bible was NOT written by God but by men and it does NOT represent the WORD OF GOD. I strongly urge one and all to read Saul Alinsky
