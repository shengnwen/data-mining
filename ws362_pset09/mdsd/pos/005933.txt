I do think that the authors are generally right about the situation--that we are trying to create an empire out of our debts (as in, we owe so much that the world--or our bankers--will keep lending to us), and that in the long run this will not extend our empire into, say, the next century.

But an internet friend reported that listening to the authors' recommendations some years back cost him a good chunk of his retirement nest egg.

In other words, based on his experience, I'm not sure their ideas on how an individual should react to the problem are going to work--a least in any time line we are likely to be using.
