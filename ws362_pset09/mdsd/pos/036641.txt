Farley Mowat performed an excellent service when he wrote this  book.   Dian Fossey was a woman of great character, confidence,  courage,  determination, and conviction.  Her life was lived for  what she found to  be a greater cause and the world is that much  worse off without her. This  book did an excellent job of showing the reader who Dian Fossey really was  and what she really went through.  I recommend it to anyone.  It is well  worth reading
