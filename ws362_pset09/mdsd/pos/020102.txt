Krazy Kat is an odd duck of a book. Cantor recasts the comic strip characters with imagination, and the book is entertaining from start to finish, with some bizarre directions. I liked the setup, in which the gang  has not worked for years because Krazy became disenchanted after witnessing  an atomic test (and became an admirer of Oppenheimer and his anguish).  Krazy is an innocent with a sort of Boopish hidden sexuality, and Ignatz is  a clever schemer. The fifth panel, in which they imagine themselves as  humans in an S/M relationship, is pretty wild. The novel has that sterility  that comes with clever postmodern work - a couple days after reading it I  had forgotten completely about it. But it certainly was fun while it  lasted
