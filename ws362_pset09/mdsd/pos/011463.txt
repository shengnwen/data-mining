The Divine Invasion clearly fits the category of science fiction, unlike its predecessors A Scanner Darkly and VALIS, which are just marginally science fiction. But Dick departs from conventional SF by assuming the utter reality of what religion describes, while staying within the scientific spirit of the quest for objectively verifiable knowledge. He continually alludes to religious and philosophical ideas of great profundity and historical resonance, while through the very structure of the narrative he emphasizes the relativity of time. The "divine invasion" refers to the invasion of the world by Yah (God), directly opposing Belial (Satan) who rules it. This sounds simplistically dualistic, but the overt Gnosticism of the religious premise contains many subtleties. Yah inflicts Job-like suffering on Rybys Romney, the mother of Emmanuel, a brain-damaged child who is the Christlike incarnation of God. But by "falling" into incarnation, the god is humanized. The music of English Renaissance composer John Dowland forms a backdrop to the novel, giving it a tender and classic flavor amidst the science-fictional trappings. This book will strike many as an odd mixture. I find it a wise book, permeated by knowledge and compassion, that opens new vistas in speculative fiction
