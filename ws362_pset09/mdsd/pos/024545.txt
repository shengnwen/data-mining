PICTURE ME ROLLIN' is a candid snapshot into the gritty tale of Esperanza Cepeda, an ex-con who goes down for the sake of having her boyfriend Jesus' back.  As luck would have it, although she's only been gone a year, Jesus has been doing other things with other women, as well as spending the same money she got busted for.  Sometimes, we have to learn the hard way.

With a probation officer scrutinizing her every move and a sister who has given up the street life, Esperanza realizes she needs to find truth in herself and live life the honest way.  Deciding to get her high school diploma, she meets Maite Rodriguez, a teacher who not only understands what she has been through, but also helps her define the potential she holds to do something better. Things get a little sticky when Esperanza can't get away from Jesus, as he wants her to do one "last" job with him.  Finally realizing that the only person she owes loyalty to is herself, Esperanza reclaims the life that was once taken. 
 
Black Artemis does an excellent job with this story, providing a picturesque view of street life and the effects it has on young people.  The characters are fresh, intense and provide a hauntingly close reality of an environment all too familiar to some.  With constant references to Tupac Shakur, a lyrical genius, PICTURE ME ROLLIN' is filled with poetry that parallels life.  A deep, thought-provoking novel, this story is sure to keep you wanting more.
