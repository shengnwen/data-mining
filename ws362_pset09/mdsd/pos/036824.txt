Alice Faye Cleese's book is filled with fascinating case histories -- including some famous folks' relationships with their mothers(ie Mike Nichols, Stephen Sondheim, Lauren Hutton and  the author's husband--the celebrated actor John Cleese.   In  today's world   career moms don't have as much time to spend on 'der kinder' as my mom's generation, and I have heard sad stories, particularly about those young people growing up in the 'drug' age.   HOW TO MANAGE YOUR MOTHER will be helpful  for all  problem mothers and children  to open a dialogue for further understanding of their relationships  It  might not have been as necessary in my mother's day when fewer women had careers;most of their time was devoted to their families, so much so that when children grew up many moms didn't have enough of their own interests   to fall back on. This easily read  'textbook' offers solid advice!  And it encourages you to 'remember mama' .I always had a very close relationship with mine, but she has been dead over 40 years and I don't always think of her. The pleasure for me in reading How To Manage Your Mother was that it not only brought back many warm and tender memories, but also in pointing out many bad vibes between parent and child, it made me realize how lucky I was to have had a mother as beautifully giving as mine. Cornell University has now added this book to their psychologicl reading list, but it's great for the layman! I can't wait for the sequel on managing fathers--not just because I'm a dad, but what a nice gift for my sons and grandsons next Father's Day
