Being new to the thought of DZ Phillips I was very excited to read this work. While he does a good job on the topic, he is a bit overzealous in his criticism of other philosophers. However, don't let that stop you from buying this book. If you want to be encouraged and challenged to think DZ Phillips is a great read.

Sadly, I recently discovered he had passed away. I heard that while he can be very biting in his books, in person he was a wonderful person
