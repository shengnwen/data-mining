What an absolutely terrific book!  Michael Pate has written such a motivational book with, "When Big Boys Tri."  It is outstanding and a GREAT book for ALL triathletes - big boys, little boys, big girls...(well, you get the idea)

The book is inspirational for anyone consumed with the desire to complete a triathlon or to go on to their next triathlon.  Throughout the book, Pate has interwoven truly unique and motivation sayings.  My favorite was a thought-provoking poem written by Arnold Palmer.

"When Big Boys Tri" isn't really a book about reducing your time (although he has many great suggestions), and in some ways it is not so much a book about the races themselves.  As the title indicates, Michael Pate has written a special book about the journey itself - as you strive for the triathlon race and as you strive toward being the best that God has designed for you
