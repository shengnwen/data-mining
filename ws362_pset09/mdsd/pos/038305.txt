The Chocolate Cat Caper is the first in the Chocoholic mystery series by JoAnna Carl. Like a candy bar, the book goes down easy and leaves a sweet taste in your mouth. Soon, you will want another (book, that is).  The story is about former Texas trophy wife Lee McKinney as she begins a new life in a Michigan lakeside resort town. Lee helps her beloved Aunt Nettie run an upscale chocolate shop. At a catered affair at a wealthy but hated resident's home, the hated woman dies after ingesting Aunt Nettie's chocolates. A man from Lee's teenage past is the victim's widower. He clashes with the woman's personal assistant, who has taken the murder very hard. Can Lee exonerate her chocolate shop before it is forced to close from lack of business?

This book would make a great TV episode a la Murder She Wrote. It is entertaining with a solid mystery for the reader to solve, but does not contain any very dark subject matter, sex, or profanity like so many other mystery series out there.
