I don't go into the plots of books when I review them as many have already done so. I always look forward to another James Lee Burke novel, and Pegasus Descending does not disappoint. Dave Robicheaux is one of my favorite protagonists -- a man who is not perfect, has his weaknesses, but always tries to do the right thing.

I highly recommend the Dave Robicheaux series
