not a new cookbook but includes 100's of delicious easy recipes for vegetables you can grow in your garden or buy at your supermarket.  I believe these recipes are from The Victory Garden tv series on PBS, which is no longer on.  The best part is the simplicity of the recipes but when you need a challenge it's there too.  The book is divided into sections according to the vegetable and methods of preparation, from soups to gratins, to souffles.  A wonderful find
