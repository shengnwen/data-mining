Another fine effort by Bouchery in the World War II genre. This particular work focuses on the equipment, clothing and personal items borne by British, Canadian and Free French paratroopers for the Normandy Invasion. Period photographs as well as staged images with period gear and clothing give the World War II military buff a great guide. Now I would like to have a similar work for the Market Garden operations that include the Polish paratroopers
