Harry Starks is a British recidivistic businessman (gangster of sorts) in the 1960s and 1970s who just happens to be homosexual. Told through various points of view of people who've encountered Starks (a lover, an employee, a friend, a former movie star, a professor), it develops into a brooding, deeply fascinating story on the nature of justice and law. Starks is not a heroic figure, but rather a noble one, in a way, despite his dark moods and his knowledge of torture. Definitely one of the most arresting books in the mystery genre I've read in ages
