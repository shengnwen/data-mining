I can't really expand on all the great things said about this book.  The characters intertwine perfectly, and their stories are all told in a manner that makes almost every character stand out with their own exciting backstories.  I really enjoyed this book.  It provides facts and information through the course of an intriguing story of westward expansion, without the typical dryness and 'weighing down' effect inherent in most historical accounts and biographies.  The author displays an incredible knack in keeping the story flowing.
An excellent read!
