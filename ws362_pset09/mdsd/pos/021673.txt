This work is comprehensive, well researched and just as importantly, well written.  Not only is the music addressed, but the problems this music encountered in the early years, something that is now often forgotten, is throughly examined.  The social impact of this music, one of the most important aspects in my way of feeling, is examined in great detail.  Of less personal interest to me was the business end, but that is just me, but I feel that many would find this fascinating as well as the rest.  This work goes along way in helping understand R&R, our society in general and our culture in particular.  I found this to be a well organized, easy read and one that I do recommend for your library.
