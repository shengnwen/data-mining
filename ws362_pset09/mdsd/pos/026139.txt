Anne Tyler is my favorite writer, and this book is one of my personal favorites.  I loved the Tull family, and having not grown up in the perfect apple-pie American home, I had much to relate to in each member of the family, including Pearl, the resentful, bitter mother.  I appreciate the charm and the skill Anne Tyler uses in developing such rich characters.  I think about Cody and Ezra, Jenny and Pearl each time I visit Baltimore!  She writes with humor and forgiveness so that even the most deplorable of her characters ends up being understood, if not downright amusing and loveable, even. My first "grown-up" novel that I read as a girl was written by Anne Tyler.  In fact, reading her novels inspired me to become a writer.  A big thank you to Anne Tyler for Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant
