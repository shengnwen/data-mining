If you like your fairy tales totally authentic and not Disney-sized, you will love this one!  It's Snow-White with all the scary parts left in--the wicked stepmother asking for the liver and lungs of the dead Snow-White, the prince falling in love with a dead body---it would have been a little much for my sons had they not been 8 and 11 at first reading!  As it was, they liked this a lot---perhaps because I don't let them watch horror movies and this is as close as they get!

But besides that, this is a beautiful book.  It's an interesting set-up, with all the writing on alternate double pages and the big picture spreads on the others.  The pictures are extremely detailed and wonderful to look at.  However, if you are doing this as a read-aloud, it's sometimes hard to give the pictures their due, as the kids are eager to hear what happens next and you have to turn to the page to read that.  It's the sort of book you would need to have around the house a lot, so they would be able to look at it at their leisure.

I would say this is most definately for ages 8 and up or so!  It's a gorgeous book, and a more compelling story than the fairy tale I remember
