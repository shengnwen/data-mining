The authors of The Rancho de Chimayo cookbook DO love New Mexico. The sub-title states: &quot;The Traditional Cooking of New Mexico,&quot; and the cookbook lives up to that statement. The first 48 pages gives history of New Mexico through native foods, folk-lore, spirituality and settlers bringing their own norms of food production. Unfortunately,you will not find the flavor of New Mexico in restaurants outside of N.M. I lived in N.M for 10 years. If you have ever been charmed by N.M.'s food &amp; beauty you can re-create this experience through this cookbook. Try it
