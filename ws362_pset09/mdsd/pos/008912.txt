This was my introduction to Lois Meade and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A little bit different--Lois is a house cleaner--and we get to know her family while Lois goes about trying to solve this mystery.  I am looking forward to reading more about Lois and her family.  I gave this 4 stars instead of five only because nothing is really perfect
