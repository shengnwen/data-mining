As an American History major in college, I went into this book thinking it would give me a good beginner's understanding of who Martha was and how she contributed to the events in George Washington's life.  Although the book did clearly show what I was looking for, I got a lot more than I thought I would.  A biography at heart, this is a detailed and beautiful portrait of a woman I have now come to admire.  Although one of the main focuses of the book is (once past the childhood and first husband years) Martha's life with and effects on George, it keeps Martha's emotions and motivations clearly pictured through all the events of her life.  Once fully into the chapters on Martha's life with Washington, I saw a portrait of George through Martha's eyes: the husband she loved, cared for, and was deeply worried about from the Revolution years until the end of his life.  In the end, the biography was not just of Martha; it was of every life Martha touched.  In providing a detailed but not inhibiting narrative, Brady has succeeded in not only giving us a sense of Martha's importance to America, but also her importance to the people she lived with and a picture of a lovely and woman: caring to the point of being overly protective sometimes, brave and stubborn in being with George whenever possible, faithfully doing her duty to both her husband and country, and a compassionate woman who stood for her beliefs and family like a rock despite all the tragedy in her life.  Overall, this book is probably the best introduction to the life and world of Martha Washington for anyone simply interested or anyone devoted to understanding history and the women in it
