 Although the word 'masterpiece' has been overused and hence lost its real meaning, the word was invented for works like this. "Absalom, Absalom!" is Faulkner's dark, dense and brooding epic about the fall: the fall of the South, a Southern Family, Charles Sutpen and every other character involved.  Told in a variety of narratives the work is difficult at first, yet something early in the book clicks and the language is a pure genious in narrative technique. 
    The novel reminded me of Garcia Marquez's "Autumn of the Patriarch". Marquez was heavily influenced by Faulkner and the first to admit it. Yet this novel preceeded Marquez by as much as 35 years. Anyone interested in Literature with a capitol L should read this novel.
