When I first got this book I was put off by its size. I mean what developers have time to read books over 400 pages long? And this one is over twice that size. But I started reading it and I found that it is clear and explains things very well. I also found out that I don't need to read the whole book, because it is broken up into different subjects -- really like several books in one book. I am a single independent developer that is working on building a huge PHP, MySQL Web site and I need to know how to use MySQL very effectively and how to optimize what MySQL has to offer. Since I'm outsourcing all my hosting, at this time I don't need to know about MySQL administration, and since I'm only using PHP, I don't need to know about the other APIs, and I can use the appendixes as a reference for functions and such. So I only have to read about 350 pages instead of 1150. And if I find I need to know about MySQL admin or about another API, it's right there.  So, I'm happy, and the book is great. I've read 100 pages so far
