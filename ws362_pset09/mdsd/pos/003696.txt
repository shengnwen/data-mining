This is the up-dated edition of Michael Wood's classic work on the Trojan War.  The new material is important in light of recent excavations at Troy.  As always, Wood's books are exceptionally interesting to anyone keen on history, archaeology and travel.  But, as good as the book is, the DVD of the original television series that the book accompanied is even better.  I wouldn't be without either
