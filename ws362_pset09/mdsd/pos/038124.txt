My 5 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old sons LOVE these books, I am amazed at what they have learned to draw, and they enjoy creating their own versions of the faces shown in the book.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter really likes to point out her favorite monsters for all of us to draw for her.  This book encourages creativity and independent artistry
