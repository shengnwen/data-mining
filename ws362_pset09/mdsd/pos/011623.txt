This is a very nice commonplace book for the fans of A Series of Unfortunate events.  Nicely bound, and quotes from the books are scattered throughout the pages.

I am not sure why everyone else is so upset about this book.  It is fairly obvious it is not a new book.  The title doesn't match new books, the price isn't the same, it came out only 6 months after the most recent edition (book 12), and in the listing I see, it says, "(Journal)".  The cover doesn't even look like the cover of one of the books in the series.

Must-have for the Baudelaire fan who wishes to keep his or her own journal
