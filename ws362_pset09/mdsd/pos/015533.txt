What I like about this book is the "short and sweet" chapters written by various authors.  I believe most authors can be succinct when they have to be, otherwise, they tend to overwrite and get wordy in order to meet publishers demands for size.  I have a better understanding of progressive viewpoints because of reading this book; some I agree with and some I do not. Its a keeper for reference.  I especially liked David L. Turner's viewpoints and was disappointed to find he has not published anything else.
