Once again Nora Roberts manages to keep her readers enchanted with a storyline that is completely unique. Mixing Greek mythology into the plot is a wonderful way to keep things interesting and prevent the story from becoming stale. It's always refreshing to know that if I pick up a book by Roberts, I am not going to be sucked into another typical "romance" storyline with Fabio as the leading man. Robert's realistic characters blow me away everytime, and the amount of knowledge this woman has of various cultures and general information just amazes me.
