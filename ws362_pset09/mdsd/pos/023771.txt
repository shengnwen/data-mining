The Turn of the Screw is a classic nineteenth century work by Henry James. Though it does contain some elements of melodrama, it also deals with issues important to the time. James is heavily influenced by the overall repressiveness of Victorian England. Though it can be interpreted as a horror story, it is also a social commentary on class structure and sexual repression. James's subtle writing style works well in this story and make sit suspenseful and gripping. The long sentences and flowery language of that period do not detract from the story. Instead of being tedious and slow it is very engrossing. Perhaps what is most enjoyable about the story is the ambiguity of it all - the reader is left guessing at the end, is left to decide what really happened for themselves. It is not like a modern ghost story - there is no blood and gore, no quick slasher thrills. Instead it is chilling and ominous - James works more with what is left unsaid than what is apparent on the surface.
