As a former English teacher I wish I had been able to use &quot;Angels On The Roof&quot; with my classes. What begins as a teenage comedy turns to a mystery, a search for past and future, a &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; for today's teens. But what is so moving is that like many classics, the novel can be read on many levels. It's not only a search for self but for sexual realization. It's not only a mystery as to why Shelby's mother keeps taking her from town to town in the middle of the night, it's a coming of age story.  &quot;Angels On The Roof&quot; is as multi-layered as the canyons in which the story takes place.  Her use of metaphor and image from red rock country to Georgia O'Keeffe pictures, from Salinger to Shakespeare makes &quot;Angels On The Roof&quot; an enriching experience for all, one that not only adds to the life of a young person, but adds to the experience of an adult.  Humor, mystery, search for self, coming of age, literate, insightful.  What more could a teacher ask of a book?  Martha Moore, where were you when I needed you?  (At least I have you now.
