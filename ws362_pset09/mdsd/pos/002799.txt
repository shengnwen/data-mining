I can't remember when I've read a book that would appeal to such a range of readers. My 12-year-old grandson loves it, and I, his grandma, did too.
Yes, the writing is not as polished as it could be; it is sometimes repetitive, for example, but the basic story is sophisticated enough to really hold one's interest. The young protagonist is a captive of his traditional enemies, yet his "master," the dragon jouster, treats the boy so well that he learns to care for him. 
I found the conclusion truly moving.
