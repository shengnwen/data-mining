I really enjoyed this book.  I particularly like that enlightment values are opposed to modern world views regardless of whether those are the views of the left or the right, Christians or Muslims, democrats or republicans.

He doesn't make any effort, though, to tell us HOW this came about, but instead simply demonstrates that it has come about.

The only negative comment made by the other reviewers that I agree with is that the book needed a stronger editor.  Some of those chapters really wander around
