Covey claims that after studying the two - hundred year American history of Success Literature he found it to concentrate too much on the 'character-principle' approach .In place of this he provides seven principles which he believe provide a more pragmatic and realistic way to success in managing one's business, money, family. Covey himself , in good part thanks to this book, which reportedly has sold fifteen million copies to date the best example he can give of the success of his own method.
His seven principles are as follows:
 1: Be Proactive: Principles of Personal Vision 
 2: Begin with the End in Mind: Principles of Personal Leadership 
 3: Put First Things First: Principles of Personal Management 
 4: Think Win/Win: Principles of Interpersonal Leadership 
 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood: Principles of Empathetic Communication 
 6: Synergize: Principles of Creative Communication 
 7: Sharpen the Saw: Principles of Balanced Self-Renewal 
His idea is that if we make these principles habits of our action then we will manage and succeed in a better way than we have until now. He insists that this is not a short- term overnight method but a way to change our action for the long haul.
It would be interesting for some social- scientist to do a research and see what percentage of those who have truly tried to employ Covey's method do succeed.
As for me I think I am just too old to buy any set of 'made- up principles' like this. 
But essentially my feeling about this book is similar to my feeling about works like "I'm O.K.- You're O.K.' or the classic ' How to Succeed in Business without really trying" If it works for you , good, and if it doesn't perhaps there are other things more important for you, and other ways of finding them
