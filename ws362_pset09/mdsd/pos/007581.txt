If you love card games, but just about played every game you know to death and need something new, this is a great book.  This must have every card game with every variation of it ever concieved.  It gives good explanation of each game, along with how they are played in different parts of the  world.  The problem with the book, however, is the same.  It has every rule  to every game ever written.  It is not a good book for reading, but a great  one to have on the side in case you are ever really bored, or can't decide  on all the rules of a game.  It is great for anybody with that old game  they just can't quite remember all the rules to.  Problem solution:  if you  find a game you like, have a hilighter pen readibly available for the table  of contents.  it is easy to loose track of what may have been a great new  card game.  Recommended only for real big card game buffs
