Before i read this book,little i know that this book could be a fast moving mystery book.the book is about a mystery surrounding one family of a poor woman who has been convicted with murder.but for the obvious reason(whodunnit),she is the most unlikely person to kill the victim...and the story goes on how hercule poirot investigates the murder to assist an innocent party....this book must be put on your upper shelf!!
