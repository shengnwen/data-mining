Frederick Marryat was a sea captain who served under the famous Lord Cochrane. This book was an inspiration to such later writers as Patrick O'Brian and C.S. Forster. It is a little like Tom Jones in that it  episodic, even picaresque. It is very funny in parts, in a way that O'Brian  is not--you get the sense that Marryatt is weaving in incidents and  characters from his own naval career. It certainly helps to have read  O'Brian for a deep understanding of the culture, but with Marryat you feel  at times that you are in touch with the real thing
