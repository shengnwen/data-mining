Albert Ellis wrote a goldmine of a book to help people and therapists heal those who are in pain with destructive beliefs, post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, marriage and family, jealousy, OCD, and many other difficulties that CAN be healed. It requires commitment and dedication on the part of the individual to want to heal. 

One of the key points in this book is that our unhappiness stems from irrational beliefs, "must", "should" and how important it is to "create a vital meaning and absorbing interest in your life..." 

This book will be outstanding for anyone committed to his or her own self growth, healing, with the strong desire to turn it all around. 
Highly recommended!
