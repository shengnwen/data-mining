I taught preschool last year to a group of 3 to 5 year old children.  In 9 short weeks, they learned the alphabet and 3 to 5 words for each letter of the alphabet.  For preschool graduation they performed Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in sign; what a spectactular sight it was.  The kids were in awe watching their teacher, and learning, not once did I find a child bored.  Most of these kids are still learning at home with their moms or dads, and can still do &quot;their&quot; song.  This is a wonderful book and learning tool for these kids.  As an adult, I found it very un-intimidating, and was able to learn with my &quot;kids.&quot
