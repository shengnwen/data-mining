This is a great book. I recommend this to someone who understands kids. And who likes them, too.The authors message is sometimes telling stories gets you into trouble. The message is good. The first chapter is a little unclear, but I could still understand it. Julian is the character who makes the book perfect. Huey is the one who makes the sparks. Julian and Huey are the best characters for the book. This is the book for you
