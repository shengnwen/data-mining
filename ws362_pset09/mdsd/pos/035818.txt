I love The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles because it is short. It is not extraneous like Dianetics. I think even the average reader could finish this book in four evenings. Some of the chapter titles are 6.How Riches come to you; 7.Is your gratitude showing?; 8.Thinking in the Certain Way. Keep reading this book everyday. You will get ideas to turn your life around
