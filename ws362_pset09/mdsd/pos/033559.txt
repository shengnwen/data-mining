"In Search of Excellence" is an interesting book to read which was an international bestseller when it was first published in 1982. The book was written for the general public in simple and easy to understand language and explores the art and science of management used by leading companies with records of long-term profitability and continuing innovation. However, the information presented was not based on hard data (or based on faked data), which was its main weakness.

This controversial book had a widespread impact on Wall Street analysts and corporate management at its time of publication. The word Excellence appeared on many American corporate strategy statements.

However, some few years later, a significant number of the companies highlighted in this book as fine examples of Excellence, particularly high technology companies including Atari, Data General, DEC, IBM, Lanier, NCR, Wang, Xerox and others failed to produce excellent results. The book "In search of Stupidity by Merrill Chapman" chronicles some of the fallacies propounded in the book especially with respect to the high technology companies profiled in the book.

The book is divided into eight chapters which correspond with the main themes which Peters and Waterman argued were responsible for the success of the cited corporations, as follows:

* A bias for action: active decision making or getting on with the job. 
* Close to the customer: learning from the people served by the business.
* Autonomy and entrepreneurship: entails nurturing innovation and promoting champions. 
* Productivity through people: treating ordinary employees as a source of quality. 
* Hands-on, value-driven: a management philosophy that guides everyday practice - management showing its commitment. 
* Stick to the knitting: settle for the business that you know. 
* Simple form, lean staff: some of the best companies have minimal overhead personnel particularly at head office.
* Simultaneous loose-tight properties: giving autonomy in shop-floor activities whilst maintaining centralised values. 

The book has some interesting features as can be seen from the themes highlighted above that it is still worth buying.
