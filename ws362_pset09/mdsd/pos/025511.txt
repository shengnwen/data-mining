I have used this book with children in social skills groups to teach them how being mean to other kids can hurt them. Even though the kids found some of the book funny, and loved the illustrations, they didn't entirely understand the point at first.  The book is rather complex, and most young children won't get the underlying message without some adult coaching to help them understand it. I do believe the book is worth it, though, because what the author is trying to teach is so important
