I wont bother to summarise the plot, as all the other reviewers have done that before me. This is a hilarious book, the wizards made it better by a half. The serious bits are always my least favorate (probably because most of the other books I read are ALL serious) but I think the dramatic battle points in this book are rather better than Pratchett's usual ones. Maybe because the elves are more villianlike than his usual villians. (the withches always seem to get the best villians)

The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five was because I thought the elves weren't very convincing for Pratchett's realistic fantasy style. I mean, of course if cats where humanoid they would probably act the same way, but since they obviousely aren't*, theres less reality to the elves.

I'd still recomend this book, especialy to someone who likes the witches.
