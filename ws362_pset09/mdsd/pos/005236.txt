I can see that this is not the book for you if you want to solve a particular differential equation.  But in terms of understanding the field of dynamical systems, there is no rival.  This book is a pleasure to read, for the first time I understood the importance and beauty of linear algebra.  Academic Press says that this is their most successful mathematics text, and it is not hard to see why.  I wish more texts were as clearly written and as beautiful to read
