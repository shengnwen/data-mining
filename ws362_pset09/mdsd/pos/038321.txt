I recently took the A+ and used this book to prepare for it. I reviewed the entire book before taking the exam and took all of the practice exams that came with the book, both the ones that were in the book and the ones on the CD included with it. I did pass my A+, but however, I must say that this book did not cover everything in enough detail. Many of the things on my exam were not covered in enough detail, especially upgrading and using the recovery console. The hardware preparation was a bit better, especially the printer section in my opinion. However, the author has a great writing style that keeps you interested in reading instead of boring you to sleep.
