The John Rain character is high on my list of enjoyable novel material, and Barry Eisler's latest installment, The Last Assassin, didn't disappointment me.  I enjoy the mix of professional killer struggling to get out the life...

Rain finds out his last fling with Midori (the daughter of a person he killed) produced a son that he didn't know about.  Midori can't forgive Rain for killing her father, and doesn't want him to be part of her life (or the life of the child).  Rain wants a chance to see his son just once, but doing so could end up getting all of them killed.  Midori is being watched by Rain's enemies with hopes of finding his latest whereabouts, and there's no doubt that she'll be used as bait if needed.  Rain's confusion over his feelings towards Midori is causing him to make some mistakes, and now he needs to call in favors and friends to clean up the mess he created.  Even that isn't as cut and dried as it should be, as one of his friends is his current lover who works for Mossad, and she doesn't want to loose Rain to a past flame...

This book doesn't have quite the same action level as the first couple of Rain novels, so it may not be received with the same enthusiasm as prior works.  Also, it helps to have read all the other novels prior to this one, as the characters and interaction are more colorful when you know the past history and storylines.  But for the Rain fan (and I consider myself in that crowd), this is another fine read by a very talented writer..
