I'm confused by my reaction to the book. As an editor of MAVIN, a multiracial magazine, I would think that the stories told in *What Are You?* would incite well-versed reactions. However, I had butterflies  opening the envelope and while quickly skimming the table of contents.  Quickly the euphoria changed to familiar, yet repressed feelings of  'other-ness,' alienation, ambiguity--almost sadness. The book's impact is  inevitably felt on all levels, as being mixed is something you can never  truly 'abandon' or 'escape;' it is intricately woven into every experience,  simple and profound. Now I understand that the source of my confusion is  the gradual process of the book's impact as it revisits myriad experiences  in my history, and stirs them all up again. As they settle back down, the  influence of each experience has been slightly altered and better  understood. Congratulations and thank you for creating a powerful resource  whose impact waxes daily
