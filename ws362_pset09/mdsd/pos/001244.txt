I am thrilled to see a second edition of Annette Simons classic book. As a group process facilitator she lays the ground work for organizational practioners and individuals alike to discover the power of stories. My work has been inspired and guided by this book. The book is short on theory and vague promises and rich in compelling examples. Annette's understanding of stories elucidates a life (organizationally and personally) richer in reflection and full of surprising intersecting connections to each other. And best of all, as the book guides us to rediscover the joy of stories it delights and entertains us along the way. Add this book to your library today and don't let it collect dust
