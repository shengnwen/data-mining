The first book I remember from my childhood is The Tasha Tudor Book of Fairy Tales.  Tasha Tudor's illustrations always include garlands of roses, and I always knew I was going to have a garden absolutely full of roses.  As a young adult, I was disillusioned with the modern hybrids that were available at that time.  They looked stiff and unlovely in the garden, they had little fragrance, and they fell prey to black spot and the cold northern climate.  After spending huge amounts of time, effort, and money, I had given up on roses.  Then, in the odd way things happen, I came upon this book in the return shelf at the library.  I started reading it, and finally realized what was wrong in my experience with roses.  The ideal rose in my imagination was a historic rose, not a modern hybrid tea!  Thomas Christopher, even though he was a horticulturist, made the same discovery though serendipity.  It is really fun to read how he discovered the world of heirloom roses and the people who grow them.  You will find yourself enjoying this book while reading it, and then realizing later how much you learned from it.  The book led to my gardening with old roses, and later, David Austin Roses, which are everything I ever hoped for in roses.  If you want to read more about the history of the rose, another very interesting book on the subject is The Quest for the Rose by Phillips and Rix.
