I mostly liked this book and read it quickly. Hoever I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It left too many questions unanswered and some things just didn't make sense. For example, why was Truscott always following Alex and how did he get all of hs inside information? How could Truscott and Michael Bell know that Alex went to Vermont? How could they end up at the gas station in the rental car without being seen? There were no other buildings around so someone new showing up would be seen. Why wouldn't Alex have heard the shot when Michael Bell killed Truscott. So, basically I liked the book a lot but the ending was a big let down
