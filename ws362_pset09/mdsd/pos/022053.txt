The Third volume of Neon Genesis Evangelion, is so far my favorite... This volume mainly focuses on Rei, also known as the first child who is very mysteriouse, especially to Shinji. The Begining to the book takes place after Shinji defeated the second angel. He is watching his father and notices that his fathers hands were covered with burns. He asks Ritsuko about it, and Ritsuko tells him that the burns were caused before Shinji and Misato were there. Something had gone wrong with unit 00 and Shinji's father saved Rei by forcing open the super heated hatch with his bare hands. Shinji then begins to wonder, what is so special about Rei? Rei, who's expression never changes and is almost always stiff with everybody. This is where we get to find out more about Rei then what's behind her face that always shows a seriouse mask.     Also in this book is one of my all time fav quotes.... *warning* slight spolier ahead!* This is the Quote: &quot;We may not have anything besides the EVA program now... but, well... As long as we stay alive... someday, we'll be glad we survived. It might be far in the future... but, until then... let's live on. Even on a black and empty street... if we go together... we might one day find something... like the moon the floats in the darkness.&quot
