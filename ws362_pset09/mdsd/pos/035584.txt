Since this is a book taken from Disney's film version, I can see where much change was made.  The illustrations are beautiful, more colorful, brighter than the original film.  Everything seems to be in order:  from the Evil Queen sending the huntsman to kill Snow White (he was unsuccessful) to the Queen transforming into the old witch, handing the apple to Snow White and the dwarves taking care of her until the Prince comes and kisses her awake.  Lovely little tale.  We read it on a nightly basis at our home.  My two year old fancies himself a dwarf..Happy
