Inspired by her son's photographs, Jane Yolen creates an interesting and thought-provoking series of poems about water in its many aspects. Her poems are rhythmic and fluently worded--grand examples for students of all ages. There is some variety in the types of poems included, but more would make this book even better. Most of the photographs are of a very high quality. This book has many examples of word usage as well as fluent writing, and it would be a good model for using pictures to inspire poetry
