To the one star reviewers let me just say this. Did you read any of the scriptures in the Bible on Heaven? There will be animals and exotic creatures, trees, rivers, houses, mountains, angels and people. Earth is like Heaven in these small ways. Heaven will have familiar and new things for us to see.

And for those who Quote the verse  "Eye hath not seen, Nor ear heard, nor hath entered into the heart of man......) as to say that we can't understand or envision heaven, maybe you should read the next verse whick says "But GOD HATH REVEALED THEM UNTO US by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
 
So quite simply Randy Alcorn has revealed some things in this book that the Word and the Spirit have revealed to him about heaven. 
Excellent book.
