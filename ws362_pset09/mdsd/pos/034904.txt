I bought this 8 min workout book because I loved the original book.  I liked this book, but found the book a little harder to stick to than his original because of my lack of free time. I did however read this book cover to cover and still agree with everything he says.  And as soon as school ends I will kick this program into full gear as I believe in his workouts I lost weight easily and fast on his original 8 min workout book.  So I have faith in this book.  Just stick to the program and you will be amazed how great you feel.
