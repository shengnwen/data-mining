In my search to find a slow cooker cook book that does not start off each time with "heat a skillet and braise the meat," this book has a smattering of recipies that meet that test. The one for lime and cilantro chicken is great and there are two for pot roast that have no pre-cooking required and that is my major requirement for a crock pot. I need more cook books like this, the point of a crock pot is not to have to pre cook and this cook book has some recipies that fit the bill.
