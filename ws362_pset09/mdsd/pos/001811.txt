Never having read any of Rice's Vampire Chronicles, I was happy to find that this book does stand alone - no previous knowledge required.

Lestat, almost a drama queen in his moments of self-loathing, is approached by a man named Raglan James, who proposes a trade.  He will let Lestat be human again, something Lestat believes he wants, by swapping bodies.  It is to be a short-term swap, and Lestat overlooks every sign that this could be a bad idea.  His friends, human and vampire, warn him against it; James admits to being a liar and a thief... and Lestat takes the risk anyway.  How horribly wrong it goes and how it is righted is an interesting story you'll just have to read to discover.

His short lovestory with Gretchen, a nun who nurses him back to health, is unexpectedly poignant and touching and their eventual reunion is heartbreaking.  Finally, the way Lestat repays David Talbot for his help in reclaiming his own body is nearly perfect, ruined only by David's forgiveness.
