The thing I like most about McGuane is his sense of humor regarding the overlooked. His characters are normal people. But they are also edgy. They are gritty and fleshy. I sense though that he would rather be on a horse than writing a novel. I know I would rather be on a horse right now. This is a good book. I also reccomend &quot;Some Horses&quot;. It is a book of essay's he wrote that every horse or book fan should read. I just read it for the second time
