I just got done reading through A Whole New Mind, I started about a week ago.  I am 26 years old, married to a wonderful and beautiful wife with two girls (one 2 years old and one 8 months old).  I have known for a while that I love what I do for a living (transportation engineering consultant) and that I work for a great company with great people (started working right out of college almost 4 years ago). With all of this wonderful life, I have only recently discovered my own true worth, which has helped me to create a better work-life balance (but not great at this point).  
 
I want to thank Dan Pink for taking the time and effort to write this book, it is what I have been looking for (insightful, funny, and actually gives ways/steps to do what the book says by means that are for the most part freely available in abundance). I am glad that I have discovered this book (thanks to one of many mentors at work) at such a young age and a pivotal time in this ever changing world (I actually called my brother - 25 years old, who was studing to get into an MBA program, during Chapter 3 to tell him to read this book before he studied another minute). From what I can tell, Dan Pink has had an extraordinary and fulfilling journey writing this book, I only wish I have his kind of success in life.
