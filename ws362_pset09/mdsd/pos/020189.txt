and writes about a truely dislikable protagonist.  Seriously.  This is not some 'dark heart' who has changed their ways, or some heartless thief with a quick tongue and a way with words.  She is simply a genuinely dislikable person.  She really doesn't care about anyone except herself, and acts constantly from a sense of self-interest.  Great events happen around her, and she is unmoved, except to care about the possible danger to herself.

The net effect, of course, is to isolate the reader from these great events.  It's only with consideration that you realize that if the point of view was shifted slightly, you'd be reading an epic, a book about an adventure - maybe not one with a worldshifting plot, but quite a bit would happen.  

It's an interesting idea, and one Mievelle managed to turn into a book.  If you want something a little more fun to read, the Iron Council or Perdido Street Station is your book, but the core of this book is so fundimentally fascinating I find myself coming back to it with more interest then the Iron Council or Perdido Street Station held.
