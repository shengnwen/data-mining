This little book has all a baby/toddler likes: it is small and so easy to handle by children, it has hard cover and hard pages so it does not rip off, it is beautiful and SUPER funny.
My 16 month old daughter loves looking through the different types of dogs and 'barking tones'.
I completely reccomend it.
