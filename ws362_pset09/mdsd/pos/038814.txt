I gave this book to my Uncle who was retiring and after reading it he couldn't stop raving about it.  He said he got 25 great ideas from the book that he would integrate into his retirement.  What's great about the book is that it doesn't require reading the book cover to cover; you can dive in when and where you like and still take away wisdom and wit.  I highly recommend this book as a gift or for the soon to be or recently retired.
