Well, the only reason anyone would need this book is if they were trying to understand the concepts of literature or if they were planning to write. AH, and if they are, this book is a CRUCIAL STUDY. As an English Major, I  encountered WAY TOO MANY critiques that are based on absurd marxist  theories. Remember, literature reflects a SPECIFIC TIME, PLACE, AND ERA! I  am a devout Anglican and I DO NOT shun Hawthorne's work because much of it  is Anti Anglican. I understand that Hawthorne was reflecting an Anti  Anglican Period in America. It is absurd to judge literature harshly  because it does not fall into contemporary political slots whatever they  may be at the moment. This book by Aristotle is a concise, focused, and  appropriate look at the concept of literature. He emphasizes the need of  close conflicts as opposed to hero versus enemy. He also makes it clear  that writing must have recognition and/or reversal at some point. Also, he  states the need for surprise events. Another thing he does is he helps us  see that some events may be important, but it is better to mention them  instead of displaying them. He also stresses the need for characters to  play on our fear or pity. While this is more of a reference book,  it  belongs in the library of any student of literature
