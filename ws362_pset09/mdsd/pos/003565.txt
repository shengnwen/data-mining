David Sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive. All of his books make me laugh out loud & embarrass myself in public places, when I bring his books along. This one did not disappoint either.. FUNNY holidays tales that make the season brighter, or even out of season.. give you a healthy & hearty laugh.
I adore this man
