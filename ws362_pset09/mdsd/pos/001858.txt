I bought this book for my wife who has had FMS for 4 years. I wanted her to get relief and it seemed like no medication was working. She used to be so active but the past few years have been hard on all of us as she tires easily and has constant muscle pain. The book helped my wife!!! Not only did she learn about the various causes of FMS, she found relief with the exercises and lifestyle approach to treatment. My wife even made an appointment with the author (MCILWAIN) and saw him last month in his Tampa Florida office. He confirmed the diagnosis and helped her understand the program even better. She now is taking only one medication and does the exercises daily. She is managing her time better and not over extending herself. These are simple steps to take to get your life back--and they work. I recommend. WE RECOMMEND
