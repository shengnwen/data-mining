Ignatieff offers a measured, limited, and explicitly political, i.e., dialogic, nondogmatic, nonmetaphysical, pragmatic, approach to human rights advocacy and questions of international jurisdiction.  Excellent, compelling, convincing.  I can't say I'm entirely convinced, mind you.  One surprise is that I found Appiah's essay--I am a great admirer of Appiah and, in my estimation, his reply to Taylor in _Multiculturalism: The Politics of Recognition_ is among the finest essays ever written--unconvincing, particularly with regards to the question of &quot;rights and majorities.&quot;  On this, see Jeremy Waldron's _Law and Disagreement_
