Gerald Stern is the lead lawyer for over 600 plaintiffs who weree suing the West Virginia coal company and their sole corporate stock holder, another corporation in New York over the flooding that killed several dozens people and leave hundreds homeless. This book not only recount the stories of the Buffalo Creek disaster in vivid details, but it explore in-depth the civil proceeding the follow the incident. Stern shows his readers in-depth the process of litigation and legal- and sometime extra-legal- tactics that lawyers employ to their advantage. This book would be an unconventional reading for law classes where students are force to study cases their ruling and the legal theory behind it, instead Stern demonstrate the real life strategy of attacks and defenses that lawyer employed. It range from how to pick a judge (and the heavy research that went behind it,) to suing through the corporate veil and going at the stock holder for compensation, and to the negotiating a settlement, and where to balance the ego of the lawyer and the benefits for their clients. Stern wrote in a non-technical style that anyone could jump in and still find it fulfilling. This is a highly enjoyable read and an enriching experience to understand the modern litigation process, it won't made lawyer out of us but it will help us know what they think.
