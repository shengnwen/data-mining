Well, I guess anything worth doing is not easy.  This book will give you the tools necessary to rid your body of candida yeast which is the root of a lot of disease we experience in the body according to many health professionals (although not recognized by most drug-pushing physicians these days).  It's a good read and full of useful, healthful information.  But, to do the candida cleasnse it mentions in the book you have to go to Dr. Jeff's website www.lifeforceplan.com and purchase his supplements to take along with the diet.  The program can take 8 - 12 weeks as well with a sensible and logical diet plan included (you have to stop feeding the yeast to kill it).  The only downside to this whole plan is the cost of the supplements which are about $576 for the whole 12 weeks or so (go to the website for details).  Otherwise, it's a good read and may be worth your time (and money)to do this cleanse, especially if it saves you a few thousand dollars in medical bills down the road (an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!)
