A quirky diatribe against the superficiality and meaninglessness of TV, with its focus on the trivial and mindless. Trow wrote the original essay in 1980, long before PCs, the Internet, and IPods, but everything he says about how TV creates an illusion of intimacy even as actually creates ever greater distance and loneliness, separating us from one another is even more poignant in today's "connected" world.

Trow's style is deceptively simple and full of irony. It takes time to learn his cadence, but it's worth it
