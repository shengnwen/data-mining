This is one of the best books I've ever read or ever will read!  It tells the story of a young Arab kid (from his point of view)living with an aging ex-prostitute ,Rosa ,in paris. Rosa raises the children of prostitutes.I  know it doesn't sound like much but believe me, you won't be sorry!  It is  almost a poetic book.It's certainly one of the most humain books you'll  ever come across. People that read and loved &quot;Angela's ashes&quot; and  &quot;Cacher in the rye&quot;,will love this book also.The book is a little  sad but most of the time it's very funny, it's a book about people,the  little people.The author, Romain Gary is very well known  all over Europe  and it saddens me that he's almost anonimus in the states.He deserves the  recognition in the states and the Americans deserve to know this great  writer.I hope he will be published again and won't be out of print.In case  you do want to read it,I think you can buy it at amazon.uk
