I was slightly put off by the cutesy chapter titles in this book.  I'm in the "Season of Mists and Mellow Fruitfulness" age bracket (fifties).  Once you get past that, the book is loaded with exercises to fit different age needs plus special situations such as postpregnancy or strength improvement or breast cancer.
He starts the 50's age section by debunking the idea that we must expect pain as part of aging.  My aches and pains seem minor compared to some reviewers' experiences, but still it encroaches on my enjoyment of daily activities such as walking or golfing.  Fear of future hip replacement or spine surgery is a powerful motivator for change.
The menu of restoration and maintenance E-cise (as he calls them)seem easy enough to undertake.  The activities for improving balance seem similar to those recommended by an osteoporosis newsletter that I take.  Since I'm just starting these, I don't have results to share yet.  Anything I do at this point should help, since it's obvious to me that my body has started protesting the neglect of the past
