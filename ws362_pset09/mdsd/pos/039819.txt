&quot;In Defense of Mumia&quot; is one of the most comprehensive political anthologies to come out of the U.S. literary cannon these last few years of the 20th century.  It is easy to see why:  with writers as diverse as Toni  Morrison, Gwendolyn Brooks, E.L. Doctorrow, Dennis Brutus and Jan Carew to  name a few, one can't help but wonder if this is the measuring stick by  which future anthologies will be judged.  For we are headed for some  serious turbulence in the coming years.  There is no room for American  artists to not take a stance on social issues where justice and equality  are at stake.  Readers deserve more works like this that allows for a  greater understanding of the machinations of wealth and its various death  machines, protecting its money.  The U.S. Judicial System should be taken  to task on the floor of the U.N. for the obvious railroading of  writer/political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Anderson and Medina should put  together more anthologies that are not afraid to challenge private property  and cultural imperialism.  &quot;In Defense of Mumia&quot; is a must read  and a must have...no doubt about it!!
