This book is a great companion piece to the Harry Potter novels.  If you love the Harry Potter stories, you will certainly enjoy this book.  It is full of interesting facts and background on the Harry Potter phenomenon.  I especially enjoyed the information on J.K. Rowling.  Since she rarely gives interviews, I was unaware of her life story and how she came to write the Harry Potter novels.  Her story from a struggling writer to one of the most successful authors in history is inspiration.  Much like the Harry Potter novels themselves, it will inspire the reader to pursue their dreams with conviction.  The information about the book publishing was also interesting, especially the facts and pictures related to the UK releases.   Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It made me want to pick up the first Harry Potter novel and start reading the series again.
