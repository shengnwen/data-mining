If you are looking for the great American novel this is not it,,,,but if you are looking for a fun read with wry humor that comments on pop culture this is it. It is much more than just a rehash of famous ebay auctions,,,nice commentary and insight with a touch of humor. You will enjoy this whether you are an ebay addict or have never looked at it
