This is an excellent book by an excellent author.  I've never been disappointed in one of his books and this is one of his best!  I wish it could have been longer or that there were a sequel to it.  The main characters are Farmer Tubbs and a lot of animals that live on his farm.  I recomment this book for anyone who likes pigs, animals, or humorous stories.  It's probably more of a child's book, but I think everyone would enjoy it
