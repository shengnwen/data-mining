I am a big fan of Greg Isles.  If you enjoy thrillers, I strongly suggest that you try reading his work.  It's not very often when a book keeps me up past midnight, but this book managed to do it.  I found THE QUIET GAME enormously enjoyable, if not particularly believable.

Unfortunately, this book stumbles when it comes to the story.  Things just get more and more unbelievable, especially if you know anything about the law or politics.  You have to believe that a major, multimillion dollar trial would be held one week after a lawsuit was filed, which is a virtual impossibility.  I'm a lawyer, and I didn't find much of the trial (which took less than a day) to be believable.  You also have to swallow an Oliver Stone-like storyline (vast right wing conspiracy in the FBI).  If this plot happened in real life, it would be the news story of the decade, but Isles treats it as primarily a local story in Mississippi!

This is one of those books here you have to set aside your disbelief in order to make it work.  In my case, though, I did. I love the quality of Isles' writing, and he just knows how to write suspense.  In the end, THE QUIET GAME did what it was supposed to do: it kept me turning the pages, wondering what was going to happen next.  Strongly recommended
