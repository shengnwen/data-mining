To be sold as a slave must be the most humiliating experience that a self-aware being can face, and Thorby is sold on the auction block to a beggar by the name of Baslim.  Baslim has barely purchased Thorby when Thorby attempts to escape.  Fortunately for Thorby, Thorby does not escape.  Being purchased by Baslim turns out to be the best thing that could have happened to Thorby.

Baslim is more than he appears to be.  Though Thorby questions little about Baslim, whom he calls Pop, Thorby learns over time that Baslim has deep secrets that he has never revealed to Thorby, secrets that he will take to the grave.

Thorby is forced to leave the home Baslim has made for him and journey into the galaxy, chased by people for reasons he does not fully understand.  But Thorby will learn that there are many kinds of families in the galaxy, with varying degrees of sincerity and complexity.  Thorby will ultimately try to claim the heritage that is rightfully his as a citizen of the galaxy.

Heinlein was called the Dean of Science Fiction because he mastered the art of telling a story simply and easily, as though he were talking about a trip to the grocery store.  Heinlein created this wonderful masterpiece in 1957, one of a string of books that drew many people into reading science fiction in the 50's and 60's, me included.  Though this novel is slightly dated, it holds up reasonably well.  Some portions may be more conceivable and believable today than when Heinlein first published the novel, as technology has made strides in some of the directions suggested in the novel.

This book is a classic that will intrigue fans of hard science fiction that enjoy a solid and interesting story.  The characters are well formed and believable, and Thorby is such a powerful individual that most readers will like him instantly, with all his faults.  This book is a good read time and again, and one that many readers will want for their personal library.

Enjoy!
