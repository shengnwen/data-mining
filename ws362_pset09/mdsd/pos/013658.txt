In all the years since the murders by Bundy and his subsequent execution, I never read this book until now.  The mind is a very mysterious organ.  How is a murderer like Bundy created?  Is it in his genes?
At this time in Phoenix, AZ we have been experiencing the deeds of two sets of serial killers.  Fortunately one pair of murderers have been apprehended.  Of course we don't know the whole story behind them but it seems their life experiences are rather average.  So what creates the murderer?
I enjoyed (maybe wrong word) reading "The Stranger Beside Me" but it's still beyond my comprehension how someone can so compartmentalize their life.
The last addendum was also interesting in that Ms. Rule is still receiving stories from "almost" victim of Bundy.  We'll never know how many there truly were
