The developing relationship between Thorn and Fone Bone hits the rocks as the Valley's political stew finally boils over.  The funny adventures of the first two books are things of the past; The Dragonslayer deals with serious issues such as fear, racism, and exploitation.  Phoney Bone has once again hoodwinked the gullible humans, becoming their de facto leader.  But his bid to steal away with their material wealth gets out of control, and by the volume's potent cliffhanger ending, Phoney will find that he's been playing games with people's lives.  Meanwhile, Thorn, Gran'ma, and Fone Bone get separated as the invader in Thorn's dreams pulls her deeper into an exhausted delirium.  This book marks a major turning point for her character.

This was likely the most challenging Bone story for Smith to write.  The worry-free fun is over, but the story has not yet reached the breakneck pace of the coming volumes, which carry the events of this book to their conclusion.  Smith's writing shines here; he manages to keep the political intrigue interesting, even funny, and there's still time for a little action and violence.

Smith has said that this is the best coloring that Hamaker has done in the series, and he's not kidding.  A few scenes lit by lamplight are particularly remarkable, yet Hamaker never allows his coloration to interfere with Smith's original art.

If the book suffers at any point, it's in that most of it happens at night, so with the new color, page after page is unrelievedly dark.  But it's a dark tale, and Hamaker avoids shadowing anything to the point that it's difficult to see
