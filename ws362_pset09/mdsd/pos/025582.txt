This book is a series of essays on several of our Founders such as Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Madison, Burr, Hamilton, etc.  The essays address how each fit into his generation and treatment by contemporaries and historians.  It is not, by any means, a recitation of dates and events.

If the book had been limited to the Introduction, essays on Washington and Franklin and the closing essay, I would give it six stars! The other essays were a bit dry and brought the overall rating down.

Regardless of how much you have read about any of these Founders, Mr. Wood brings a new and different perspective to the careers of these men.  Even if, as I have, you have read a few of the recent popular biographies of Washington, this is still a fresh look.  

What makes this book especially interesting, in addition to the author's perspective of the careers of these men from Revolution through the infancy of America, is Mr. Wood's tracking of their treatment by historians over the last 200 years.  The overview of this history is outlined in his wonderful first introductory chapter.  The theme is then carried through each essay.  

The other theme that carries through the essays is why we don't and can't have people like this running America now.  Mr. Wood blames the Founders themselves for this and his reasoning is sound.

This is a well-written, cerebral look at our Founders from a different and fresh perspective.  Highly recommended
