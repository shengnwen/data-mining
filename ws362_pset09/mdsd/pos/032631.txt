I stumbled on this book a few weeks before I became a single mom.  Talk about timing!  This is not a book that you read through front to back at once. I found myself using it more as a situational reference guide.  I also found that some topice did not apply to me (sections addressing the different ways we became single parents etc), but the parts that were for me were very helpful.  It is not a comedic book but it help validate me when I needed it most.  If you need a single mom warm and fuzzy chuckle, I recommend you also get the single mom survival guide.  It is a small - almost pocket sized book that funny, affiming and just makes you feel like you've been hugged
