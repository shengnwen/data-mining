This book has been a huge help in training my new puppy. It not only teaches you how to trian your dog but also how your dog's mind works, how to solve problems and how to "read your dog."  All in all, a great book for the beginning dog owner/trainer.  The only down side is that a large portion of the material later in the book is focused on training for a show or competition dog, not something the average dog owner really needs to know
