Mark Twain has been my favorite author since I read Huckleberry Finn in sixth grade.  I've tried extremely hard to read every single word he's written (besides, I assume, personal letters)...including, of course, the complete short stories (I love The Diaries of Adam and Eve, by the way)...but I digress.  

Roughing It is one of my top three books of all time (the other two, in case anyone was wondering, are Les Miserables and Into Thin Air [didn't say it was from a literary standpoint, just my personal opinion]).  This is mostly because of the remarkably sharp prose.  I love that this stuff (or most of it) actually happened to him, that he doesn't mind putting himself down and doesn't even make a big deal out of it...and...of course...The Book of Mormon.  Who in their right mind wouldn't immediately fall in love with Mr. Twain after reading his dissection of The Book of Mormon?  

Other reviewers have mentioned the digressions that they feel take away from the overall book.  The entire book, my friends, is a digression.  That is the point of the book.  Those years of his life had ABSOLUTELY NO POINT.  He was digressing from his life.  That's what makes it hilarious.  He just jumps from place to place (the first part is all about his travels in a stagecoach to become the undersecretary, a position he desperately wanted, or at least sarcastically-desperately...and then when he finally gets to Carson he gets bored in about a chapter and leaves, and never goes back).  I love how there's something quotably hilarious about every other paragraph, and the understatement of the humour just makes it more hilarious!  

I've read this book three times in about four years, and I recommend it to about anyone interested in an extremely funny...diversion
