This is an excellent series and one in which we get to learn more about Peabody and her family. I really enjoyed the book. But writing this review 4 1/2 years after September 11, 2001 I've got to say sometimes it was a tough read.  The book was published in 1999 before the terror attacks and speaks of an attack on the Pentagon, that happened on Sept 25 in the fictional NY past (2520 I think) and in the book several New York landmarks are either targeted or actually attacked. Including the Twin Towers. Luckly the Towers weren't a main topic and were only briefly mentioned.  
It is still an excellent read, I love the entire series, but a heads up on the content. Set in NY dealing with people who want to blow up NY landmarks
