Ok, I will admit, I have not yet read this book. But I KNOW it will be spectacular because ALL of his books are! My father introduced me to Jeff's father Michael Shaara's book "The Killer Angels" when I was a teenager. He handed it over as one would hand over a precious family heirloom. Now, years later, my father has passed on and I realize he passed on a love of history with that book. He lived long enough to read "Gods and Generals" too. 

I have read all of Jeff Shaara's books. He shares his father's gift of humanizing historical figures. He manages to repair the damage that so many history teachers do by making history a dry, boring chore. I don't know if I should put this on my Wish List or go ahead and buy it myself!!! I can't wait
