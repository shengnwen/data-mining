Nersesian is the best. The literary value in all his writing is that he makes of New York a living, hilarious and often dangerous character. Porn, drugs and an occasional unfortunate death make Suicide Casanova a wild joyride from the 70's to the 90's. Anyone who's not afraid of the darker side of human nature will get into this book. Breaking formula, Nersesian's approach to story telling [not to mention the packaging] makes this novel a collector's item
