In 13 chapters Karlyn Lotney, otherwise known as Fairy Butch, gives us a good guide on how to use strapons. The focus is on women so there isn't so much really enough about men to call it &quot;the ultimate&quot;. While there are some images there need to be more to help those trying to figure how to use them and especially on the positions you can use because a strapon is never in the same position as biological penis. A good book to help someone start out and feel more comfortable. It even includes very rare topics such as clit pumping. &quot;101 Sex Toys&quot; is a better guide to dildos and the equipment but this is a good solid place to start exploring strapons
