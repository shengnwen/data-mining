After reading only the first chapter I realized I was already following much of these authors' advice. Being cost effective is the goal of much daily living. Is it better to search for the proper postage among various scattered stamps, or just put that .39  on a lowly postcard? The few extra cents spent far outweighs the effort/time in finding the perfect stamp. I'm not lazy. The time I saved has already been used in writing these few words. Maybe a reader or two will profit from this experience too. I highly recommend "Great Decisions". Henderson and Hooper include practical examples, literary allusions and humor to make their point and teach readers how to think like an economist
