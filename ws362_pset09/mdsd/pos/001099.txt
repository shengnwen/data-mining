This book is comprised of several short stories, which, like the title characters themselves, often seem like little more than sketches.  Although I initially found that frustrating, I eventually came to realize that that works in this book's favor.  As the title would suggest, the focus is on the Maples- their marriage, their infidelities- and the brevity and compactness of the stories helps to highlight that.  Current events, politics, and the existence and plight of children are of secondary importance, and are mentioned, when they are mentioned at all, primarily to mark the passing of time and to fit the stories into a larger context.

Like a relationship that has ended, in which we remember the beginning and the ending more than the middle, the two stories that stand out the most are the first and the last, "Snowing in Greenwich Village" and the ironically-titled "Here Come the Maples".   

"Snowing in Greenwich Village" shows a young couple just beginning their lives together, naive and inexperienced, who know very little about each other.  "Here Come the Maples", by contrast, shows a couple who deeply understand one another, the result of familiarity and the passage of time as much as love.  By this point, however, it's too late, and there's nothing they can do but go their separate ways.  The final sentence is a perfect summation, touching and sad, that, despite its transparent literary-ness, still gets me choked up just recalling it.
