Kay Hooper writes a series featuring different operatives in Noah Bishop's Special Crimes Unit. What sets this unit apart from others is that the operatives all have some form of paranormal powers including Bishop and his wife (who were featured earlier in the series). This story features former army officer, Riley Crane who is blessed with spidy powers. Unfortunately, she wakes up in bed, covered in blood with most of her short-term memory missing along with her paranormal powers. She had been helping on an occult case on tiny Opal Island. The case takes a nasty turn with what seems like an occult related death. Riley warily navigates the waters with a spotty memory and evil stalking her. 

I'm not really a believer in the paranormal, but I always enjoy Kay Hooper's books. I think it is partly because the characters are always so likable. Sometimes, the paranormal is used as a device to tidy up details that cannot realistically happen, but since so much of these stories are unbelievable anyhow, it really doesn't detract. SLEEPING WITH FEAR was an engaging light read perfect for a lazy afternoon
