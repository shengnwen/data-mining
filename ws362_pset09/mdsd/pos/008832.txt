When I heard Kim Louise had another book coming out about the Algood's I couldnt wait to read it.  I must say it was definitely worth the wait.  I am so glad I dont allow other people to determine what I want to read.  I thought Morgan and Van's story was sweet and hilarious.  I found myself laughing out loud.  There was adventure, romance and comedy my three favorite ingredients for a books.  I thought Van and Morgan were cute and they complimented each other.  The book didnt bounce all over the place like a couple of reviewers would have you believe.  There was a logical progression and I thought it was important that Ms Louise give the history between Van and Morgan. I liked Destiny's Song, True Devotion and A Love Their Own, but I have to say I think With Open Arms is by far the best.  AAll I can say is Bravo Ms Kim Louise you have truly outdone yourself this time!!!!!!!!!!
