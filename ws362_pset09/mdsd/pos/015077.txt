I made the turkey and walnut meatloaf .  I don't cook very often due to my work schedule but I had the best time making the meatloaf and presto--a fabulous, light, tasty, healthy dish appeared that my husband loved!  The taste and texure reminded me of a light vegetable pate.  It was a terrific summer meal, tasting great the next day, too. 
   This makes shopping a breeze, just have the twelve foods on hand and you can't miss.  I am looking forward to having more fun in the kitchen with the blueberries that I have stashed in the freezer.  My friends will never believe that I said fun and kitchen in the same sentence.  I highly reccommend the 12 Best Foods Cookbook.
