Ask the Parrot picks up where we left Parker at the end of the novel Nobody Runs Forever. Whilst you don't need to have read that book to understand or enjoy this novel, doing so does paint a better picture for you as to why Parker is fleeing with the dogs in pursuit.  In fact I would recommend reading all the modern Parker novels since Westlake brought him back for readers through his alter ego Richard Stark with the novel Comeback. Read the ones written before that as well but Comeback is a good place to start if you haven't experienced Parker before.

Ask the Parrot is a bit slower paced then most other Parker adventures with less professionals and more amateurs, but it's still a great read.  While fleeing the police possie Parker runs into a stranger with a riffle who tells parker to get into his car.  The stranger (Tom Lindahl) was looking for Parker, but not to hand him over to the police, no he has grander plans for Parker.  Lindahl wants vengeance against his old employer (a racetrack) who fired him, he sees Parker as the ally he needs to accompany him in stealing the racetracks takings.  Parker is grateful for the help in escaping the posse, not that this alone would have made him help Lindahl but he does need somewhere to lay low until the police give up and he's never been one to turn down an opportunity that could be quite lucrative so he might as well check it out.  Lindahl soon realises Parker is a ruthless criminal and begins to have doubts about his own welfare.  Other town locals also see Parker as an easy means to even easier money.  Non of them of course realise Parker doesn't react to friendly to those who wish him harm.    

Read all of the Parker novels as well as great books such as The Ax, Smoke, The Hook and other Westlake masterpieces written under his own name as well!
