I first viewed this version when it came out in 1985. I was enthralled by it then and still love it today (I have a well-worn VHS copy from the tv.) It brings the story to life in a way that no other attempts have achieved. 
A few friends and I have been searching for this version for ages and are thrilled to have finally found it. It's strange, but I would almost place this particular "Alice" into the cult classic category. Children and adults alike will completely fall in love with this classic, I'm sure
