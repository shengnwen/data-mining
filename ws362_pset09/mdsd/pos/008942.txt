First, to all the previous reviewers of Magical Thinking, Augusten Burroughs IS a proud gay man. If only you had the facility to understand the negative impact your comments: The "eew factor" and the "stop being so gay!". Are you kidding me?! What's so irritating is that people can't see beyond the same-sex-sex thing.

I've enjoyed all his books, and am thrilled to see Running With Scissors on screen, though I'm expecting it to not deliver as highly as the book did. 
Gays rule, straights are boring
