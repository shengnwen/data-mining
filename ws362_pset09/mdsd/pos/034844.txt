After reading the reviews of those who will never try STEVIA again, I urge you to consider that you used too much extract powder, and try it again, unless you don't want to be healthy. 

This book has many good recipes, but what cookbook ever met ALL your needs? I use lots of STEVEIA everyday of the week and have had no ill affects after years. 
Maybe their headaches were sugar withdrawals? It's well known that sugar is like cocaine in your body. Perhaps I'll write an all inclusive reciepe book that will meet your needs. I want cheese cake, fudge, pumkin pie, and cookies. But NOT with sugar. Don't give up on good health or improved cook books
