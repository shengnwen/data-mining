Emily Barr's "Solo" centered around Evie, a popular and pretty cellist in London who was on the verge of divorcing her husband Jack. Thinking that she did not have enough talent, Evie relied on her looks and clothes to keep the public and media interested in her to sustain her popularity. She never revealed herself completely to anyone including her best friend Kate, as she was betrayed in high school by her best friend, Louise. After leaving Jack, Evie moved in with Megan, who was completely taken by Evie and it was this time that she started receiving anonymous threatening letters. In addition, Evie had a secret that she kept since high school that had been burdening her and at the same time, she was terrified that it might be revealed which would demolish her career.

I really enjoyed "Solo" as I felt that all the characters, particularly Evie, were extremely well-developed. The author took her time to give her characters depth rather than rushing through the whole book. Even though the characters had flaws, one can't help but root for them. In addition, the author's writing is clear and very conversational, which makes this book such a delight to read. This is my first Emily Barr's book and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing read
