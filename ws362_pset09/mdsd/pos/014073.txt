This is a great book for the non-physicist. If you are interested in the whole process of the creation of our universe this book is a great source from science perspective. Yet I think the cosmology found in Religion is much richer, in particular that of the Kabala or Jewish Mysticism. Unfortunately there aren't many books out there dealing with the topic. And both areas, the scientific and the Kabalistic, need or the math or the Hebrew to really go into them. I think Hawking really made a great job presenting an accessible book, close to the complete mathematical view, and though we lose out on the lack of knowledge of math, we gain from his layman presentation. If you want his counter part in Religion read The Structure of Creation by S. Weiss
