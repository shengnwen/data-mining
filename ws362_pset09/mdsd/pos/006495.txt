As a person who has lost 115 pounds and kept the weight off for fifteen years, I know how hard it is to find information on the very important topic of MAINTAINING weight loss.  Amongst the hundreds - possibly THOUSANDS - of weight-related books, the fad diets, the gimmicks, the celebrities and the profiteers is this GEM of a book.  This ain't no 'magic miracle diet' - Thin For Life is the REAL DEAL.  Any jaded dieter who has read the popular diet books trying to lose PERMANENTLY is sure to find this book a much-needed breath of POSITIVE fresh air!  As one of the moderators at 3FatChicks' forum (which features a long-established Maintainers Forum with great information) Ms. Fletcher's book is perhaps THE most consistently recommended.  (It's the BIBLE of the Maintainer's Forum!)  Definitely worth more than a read - this book's a KEEPER.  THANK YOU MS. FLETCHER
