This is yet another wacky crime comedy by Carl Hiaasen. The setting is of course South Florida but this time we don't get lectured about the environment but in it's place, the lament of the death of city newspapers. Of course you would expect this since Hiaasen is a newspaper journalist. Ignoring this aspect of the story, there still is much to like in the wacky brand of story telling authored by Hiaasen. We have a burglar beat up by a dead animal stored in the freezer, a Courtney Love type of widow who flashes in her video on MTV, an old rock band, the slush puppies, who are getting killed one by one. Overall it's an entertaining read with just the right amount of comedy to temper the serious pursuit of the bad guy and of course a love interest of the protaganist, Jack. Somewhere in there is the evil corporate raider who buys up newspapers and turns them into fluff with stories, graphics and entertainment in the genre of USA Today or Fox news. This has nothing to do with the main story but is this book's lecture by Hiaasen as a substitute for his usual lecture about the environment. Overall, I liked this book.
