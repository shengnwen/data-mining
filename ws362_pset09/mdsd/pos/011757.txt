This book is very well done. It is clear that Mr. Good is DEFINITELY biased in his pro-ufo beliefs, but he has gone to great lengths to in effect say, &quot;Look at this. I believe this is the way things are, but you look at the evidence I have to present and decide for yourself&quot;. There is a lot of research that was done for ths book, and I was very impressed with some of the documents that he reproduced in the illustrations and the appendices. I have seen some of the originals, and have wondered how Mr. Good acquired access to them. Very highly recommended. Do not miss this
