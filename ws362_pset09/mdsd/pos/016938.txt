Another wonderful suspense filled novel by Nora Roberts.  Eve, Roarke and all the characters in the books have become friends.  I can't wait to see what is happening in their lives.  The stories of the crimes Eve solves are terrific and having the changes in their personal lives interwoven through the series is adding another wonderful element.  These books transport me to another world.  Thank you Nora for sharing your wonderful gift of story telling with the world
