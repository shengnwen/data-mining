this book...  is a treasure.  a wealth of inspiration for persons who are waiting for real love.  i wish every teenager in the world could read this book--  i think premarital sex would become almost rare.  Trobisch paints a  picture of what a loving relationship should be, and what it can be when it  is held together by God.  he gives the best arguements, in humble, simple,  but poignant examples, of why waiting until marriage is the only way that  sex can be enjoyed as it was meant to be.  this book always reminds me that  love is so precious because it takes such commitment, patience, and  sacrifice.  the very opposite of what society today will tell you.   hopefully this Christian classic will again find its way to the hands and  hearts of people young and old
