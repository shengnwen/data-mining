"On Spetember 1, 1994 I flew to Israel and met in Jerusalem with a close friend of Prime Minister Titzhak Rabin, the poet Chaim Guri. i gave him a letter which he imediately gave to the Prime Minister. 'An Israeli mathematician has discovered a hidden code in the Bible that appears to reveal the details of events that took place thousends of years after the Bible was written.' my letter to Rabin stated. 'The reason I am telling you this is that the only time your full name -Yitzhak Rabin- is encoded in the Bible, the words 'assassin that will assassinate' cross your name."
Despite the warning on November 4, 1995 Yitzhak Rabin the Prime Minister of Israel was assassinated by a man who believed he was on a mission from God.

Michael Drosnin has written a interesting story about the 'Bible Code' and whether you believe it or not, hey it just might be true! 

The only problem with the Bible code is how do you predict the future when you don't know what to ask? I.E. how would you understand the attack on the twin towers with planes before 11 September 2001? That attack is the inspiration for BIBLE CODE II
I would like to see BIBLE CODE III to see what research Michael Drosnin has been able to find since the end of Bible Code II.
