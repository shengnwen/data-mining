I agree with the last review - although Kennedy's last chapter may have seemed very inaccurate when judged by the events in the 10-15 years after the book was written, the last few years see the US increasingly embroiled in military engagements and commitments as threats multiply. All the while, the pacific rim continues to grow and seize increasing shares of the economic wealth of the globe, unfettered by such military concerns.

With Bush in charge, this aggressive militarist, interventionist policy will only continue to expand, and thus diverting the innovation and resource from US industry to the detriment of its economy. (And it is already suffering).

Although I can't envisage the US not being one of the major world powers, due to its advanced development, natural resources, population and global economic penetration, they are perfectly capable of being overtaken by more than one rival in economic terms.

While this military overstretch continues, and commitments become entrapmnets and burdens, Kennedy's predictions are increasingly likely of becoming realit
