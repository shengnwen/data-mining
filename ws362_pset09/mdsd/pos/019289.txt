Wells has done a great deal of good for good beer in America while writing with wit and style about God's favorite beverage. But his is a catholic approach, which means it's not just about the craft-brew movement. He does a nice job of bringing readers up to date on how beer achieved its exalted place in contemporary America (as the book notes, it outsells wine and spirits seven to one.) Some chapters really stand out: his take on the Extreme Beer Movement is wonderful and his exploration of the subcult of beer-yeast rustlers is excellent and virtually unexplored territory in beer literature. But Wells also doesn't forget Norm of Cheers in the Bud bars across America and writes with empathy and humor about the America he sees "through the prism of a beer glass.
