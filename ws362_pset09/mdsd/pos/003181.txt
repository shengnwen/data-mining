Junger had me hooked in the early going with his visual descriptions of seacoast towns similar to those in which I grew up.  from there he proceeds to 'investigate' a tragedy the truth of which may never be entirely known.  His style is tasteful and informative.  while the story reads like an absorbing novel, the reader at the same time LEARNS a lot about the people involved and their world.  Junger uses history, folklore and technical data in a compelling way.  One leaves this book somehow improved, edified and very thoroughly entertained.  a masterpiece
