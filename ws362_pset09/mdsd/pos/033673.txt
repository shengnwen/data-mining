When we join (or rejoin) Rabbit in 1979, he has been the general manager of old Fred Springer's (his wife Janice's deceased dad) Toyota dealership for several years with prospects looking good in the midst of a gasoline crunch. Rabbit, that is Harry Angstrom, is hardly rich but he is content and overweight, his life revolving mostly around country club life for those with varying amounts of new money. 

But the rockiness of Rabbit's past bubbles just below the surface. When a young girl comes with a boyfriend to look at Toyota's, Rabbit immediately suspects she is his daughter from a fling some twenty years prior. And his son Nelson has returned home with a girl in tow completely undecided about his future which rekindles past father-son antagonisms.

Harry is not a particularly remarkable character; he is not very reflective, though he keeps abreast of current affairs. He is reasonably content to take life day by day with a sometimes obsession for women. The book is basically a slice-of-life book. Using remarkable powers of observation, description, and insight, the author looks at middle-age, middle-class issues of marriage, aging, boredom, children, parents, infidelity, work, worries, etc. At times the various descriptions of every nook and cranny of the small PA towns where Rabbit was raised and still lives become somewhat tedious. 

There is no plot to speak of. The book follows the life of an aging Rabbit for about six months and that is sufficient time for the author to let us all know what life is like for him or those similarly situated.
