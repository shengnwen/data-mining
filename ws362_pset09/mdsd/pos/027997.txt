A very erotic feeling (no pun intended) book, it is great for couples and romantics.  

It gets a little corny at times usually from the quotes from other couples i.e.(while talking about tomatoes) "...close your eyes and pass them between yourself and your partner, slowly, carefully. Let your imagination go..."
It's a TOMATO! Give me a break!

Great recipes with good instructions and photography that keeps your attention.  I do like this book
