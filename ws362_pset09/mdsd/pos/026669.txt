Erik Larson's DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY melded two stories together. Story One described the technological wonders of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Story Two described the work of a serial killer who preyed on victims in the anonymous crowds that flocked to Chicago during that period. Larson is a meticulous researcher and a splendid storyteller. The formula worked to perfection.

He has done it again. THUNDERSTRUCK takes readers back to roughly the same period. Another major city(London) and a notorious murder of the day. Then, we have the technology angle and this time we observe as Marconi invents wireless transmission of radio waves across the Atlantic. We have the true crime and the technology and we know that somehow Larson will tie it all together.

This book is even better than the last
