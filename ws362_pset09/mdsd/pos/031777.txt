This book is a classic when it comes to stretching, one of the first to catalog a good set of stretches for various sports. In fact, I think it was the first stretching book I ever bought and I've recently updated my worn out copy. If you want a quick reference or organized stretching workouts for any of the most popular sports, this is a good book to have on your shelf. For some more in depth instruction, more unusual exercises and the "why" behind stretching and flexibility, I would also recommend Ultimate Flexibility. Between the two, you won't really need another stretching reference
