Hank Aaron tells it like it is...this is an amazing story.  He is, hands-down, the best NATURAL home run hitter ever.  His story is captivating, but also a bit sad.  The persecution he underwent while chasing the record was horrific.  He at times sounds hurt, angry, and bitter as he tells his story.  I don't blame him...what courage
