The author, Ed Gaut, obviously knows what he is talking about.  I have purchased all of the others and none cover it as well and from a true perspective of an in home personal trainer.  The other books seem to be more of an ego thing for the authors yet Ed Gaut seems to really want the reader to succeed and I have - I am going into the year 2003 and have nearly 40 clients and am starting to have other trainers work for me.  i have gone to all the Phil Kaplan seminars and those even at the Personal training conferences like Idea and nobody has really laid it all out - the business of being a successful trainer - no wonder why Mr Gaut is such a success and why I am now one as well - thank you very much Ed!  Thank You
