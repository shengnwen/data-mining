&quot;Netspionage&quot;  or network enabled espionage as the authors defined this term is considering the competitive intelligence gathering and the various forms of espionage.      &quot;Netspionage&quot; is a  comprehensive coverage of a very important topic that worried many people  of all sorts for years. It describes how technology has changed the rules  of the game radically, and how both parties (information gathers and law  enforcement authorities) use technology in this field. It also describes  how criminals are adapting their techniques to the technical world while  chasing the information , either on behalf of governments or international  enterprises.     Unlike most security books, this one is written for  managers and executives in a very easy and clear language, since they are  the ones who must take a leadership role in safeguarding the information  assets of the networked enterprise.      This book is giving a threat  "awareness briefing" for managers and executives. It provides an easy to  read and understand look at the competitive global business and information  driven environment in which corporations must operate; as well as who is  doing what to whom and why.     Any one who is doing business in the global  marketplace will need this book if he wants to gain or maintain a  competitive edge.      I read more than one book for the authors of this  book (especially Dr. Kovacich), and I admire the way these books are  organised and the language used.     I recommend it with no conservation
