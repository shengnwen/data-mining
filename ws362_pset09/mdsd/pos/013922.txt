while i confess to only having read the first couple pages of this book, there are times a mere paragraph, or even a sentence, is enough to know you are availing yourself to a great story teller, an author, maybe even a sage.  i've ordered the book based on a sample chosen by the new york times.  i look forward to writing a longer review upon completion.  from what i've read, anyone with a mind or an appetite would feel nourished by the pages of abe opincar
