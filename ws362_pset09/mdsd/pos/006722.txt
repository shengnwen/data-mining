I picked this up at the airport en route to Lisbon and had finished it before I unpacked at my hotel.  It's been interesting to read the various comments posted here - and I think it is interesting how widely some commentators have missed the point of this novel.  It's meant to be a send up, it's clever, it's extremely well written but it's a very clear (even occasionally unkind though largely sympathetic) look at a social set that's alive and well in 21st century Britain.  Both humour and sadness run through the warp and weft of the story.

Despite Tony Blair's best efforts (and those of the EU) to homogenise British society, class and social divisions are here to stay.  I'm currently reading Roy Porter's social history of 18th century England and, alongside Snobs, it's not untrue to say that some things never change - such as the persistence of difficulty in crossing class divisions through marriage, etc.  The parvenue is still viewed with suspicion.  The anti blood sports lobby is not, really, truly, about preventing animal cruelty - it's more about the still extant chip on the shoulder of those who see it as all about pink-coated toffs on expensive horses rather than a country sport that city-dwelling people will never understand.

All in all, an amusing read with sharp insight into one echelon of modern British society.  It would make a very clever TV play.  Well, BBC - get cracking!
