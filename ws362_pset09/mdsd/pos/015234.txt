I wish I had known about this book while fighting my way through &quot;Outline of a Theory of Practice&quot;.  Bourdieu is a compelling social scientist and his ideas only look better after seeing them dissected and explained in this collection of interviews and speeches.  Like &quot;Power/Knowledge&quot;, a collection of interviews, speeches, and other works by Foucault, this work gives readers a &quot;second chance&quot; to enter an important body of theoretical work.  Of course some chapters are more compelling than others, but the good ones are very good indeed, and I found soemthing useful in just about every one.  If I had to pick an unforgettable passage in this book, it would be where Bourdieu explained why he writes in such a difficult way--it is on purpose!  In sum: this book makes a terribly important but often difficult body of scholarship more accessible
