Maya Angelou's poems are wonderful.  You can understand and grasp her meaning while she is not afraid to tell it like it is.  Her poetry speaks to the heart of every woman no matter the race.  When you read her poems you are not merely reading words but you feel the words and are surrounded by their message.  I only wished I could have studied her poetry in high school and college.  She is truly magnificent
