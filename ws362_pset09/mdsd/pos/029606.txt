    I read "Jackie's Wild Seattle". The Main charactors were Shannon and Neal.They, along with Shannon's little brother Cody, rescue animals around Seattle. They then take them to Jackie's headquarters, and she heals them. Shannon is a 14 year old girl and she is curious, adventurous, and myserious. She is also an exellent climber.
    Shannon and Cody are ataying with their uncle Neal over the summer, and they help him rescue the animals. The resolution is very good, but I'm not giving away anything. I thought that the author's style was like it was being told by Shannon, the main charactor.The theme of the book was animals and drama.
     While reading, I felt happy, sad, curioous, and shocked. I felt especially when I found out what Tyler, a kid working with Jackie for his horrible crime had done.I have never read a book like this before. I loved the suspence and drama in it.Anyone who likes animals, suspence, and drama should read this book
