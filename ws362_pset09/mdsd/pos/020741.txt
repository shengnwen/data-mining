hello!
you should definatly buy this book. becuase, she's a BRILLIANT WOMAN, and anyone who is anyone in chicago (if your a psychologist) knows my moms name. she has raised me very well, i suppose, and if you want a wonderful child with sensory problems READ THIS BOOK! whoever the insane woman is who gave it 1 out of 5 stars has no idea what shes talking about. my mother knows everything there is about this subject, and i highly suggest you buy it.
