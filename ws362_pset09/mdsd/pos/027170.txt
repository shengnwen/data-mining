I ordered this book using 1-click because I read the review about how great the CD was. After I clicked I realized that this book does not have a CD. It's okay, it is much easier to read than my assigned textbook (Smeltzer and Beare's Textbook of Medical Surgical Nursing)and I needed something to supplement so I will keep it. The CD, which I also bought, is nice to have.
