After reading other reviews of this book I feel compelled to add my two cents. Some say this book presents women in a cowardly and foolish light and that the principals contained in it are outdated; that Dr. Dobson needs to enter the 21st century. However, time doesn't change God's design and plan for males and females. He did, in fact, make us different and no liberal social agenda can change that. What Dobson has to say IS still relevant today and IS valuable to both Christians and non-Christians that are considering marriage. I would highly recommend it as reading prior to the big day
