I read this book and couldn't put it down.  It keeps you in the book and makes you wish you were there.  It was like The Riddle of the Wren, but The Harp of the Grey Rose missed out on some of the details it had.  The only thing that wasn't great about the book, is that it seemed like two stories.  Besides that, this is a great book and you should buy it
