I'm writing this after the news that the couple have split.  

The book itself is beautiful - the pictures, the quality etc.  I was dissapointed to see Jess didn't offer more commentary but the gorgeous pics make up for that.  

Jess is selling a dream in this book - but now they have split I can't quite trust in their 'happily ever after' theme.

The DVD (if you can get it) is ok - I would have liked a bit more on it for what I paid! its quite similar to the one on the Special edition 'In Ihis Skin' album so i would't be too worried if you don't get it. 

Its a good book - but is it really worth it now the couple are no more?
