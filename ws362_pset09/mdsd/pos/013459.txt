I work in the emergency room of a very busy hospital so I get to see everyone who comes in.  After a while you get to know who the "regulars" are.  It becomes very frustrating because you know these people are faking it.  They are wasting our nurses & doctors time while people in the waiting room sit and wait for hours on end with real problems.
But you can't turn people away.  Whether someone is faking it or not, they have to be seen.  

There is a psychological condition in which a person knowingly fakes an illness by simulating symptoms of a serious disease. The purpose? To attract attention.  These patients, some of whom actually make themselves ill, seem to become sick in order to achieve such gains as emotional fulfillment, sympathy, and power over their doctors and their family and friends.

I recommend this book to everyone who works in the healthcare system because I'm sure you have seen these types of cases before.  Excellent read!
