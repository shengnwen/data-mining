I've used a number of recipes from this cookbook and have been mostly pleased.  There are some nice deviations from the typical ingredients, including a few vegetables and grains I hadn't used before.  The green bean and red pepper dish has become a staple in my home, and some of the other recipes inspired me to try different casserole dishes.  Overall, I think it's a nice addition to my little cookbook collection.

However, most of the recipes in this book are very high in calories and fat.  The author uses a LOT of butter and cheese--practically every recipe calls for a tablespoon or more of butter and mounds of cheese.  Yes, you can cut back on these high fat additions and substitute oil in some places, but overall I would not call these recipes particularly healthy.  I use most of the recipes only occasionally because of this
