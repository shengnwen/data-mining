This is a lighthearted look at the intricacies of the English language: its history and development as well as colloquialisms, modern slang, and general language-mangling by non-native speakers.

If you're more fond of pedantic linguistic analysis (as many previous reviewers seem to be), it's best to look elsewhere. If, however, you have a good sense of humour and are up to a fun read, definitely check this out
