This book is a fascinating in-depth look at discovering the source and origin of why spiritual darkness is so prevalent in certain areas of the world. George Otis Jr. takes the reader on a meticulously well documented voyage into the occult strong holds such as Dharamsala, the Middle East and North Africa in search of how darkness was invited there and what activities are performed in order to keep the ruling spirit in charge. These questions are asked by the author not in morbid curiosity but in fervent prayer, so that God may reveal to intercessors how these forces can be pushed back in order for the gospel to be presented. Otis has written an outstanding book on Spiritual warfare. He accurately backs this biblically and scientifically while making a defense against those who deny that Christians are to be involved in such activities. I highly recommend this book for its insight into spiritual mapping, research (truth) and need for prayer (spirit)
