I had to read a book for a college class I was taking about leadership or teamwork. After much research of finding a book that would be of interest to me and teach me about life in general, I was recommend to read this book. At first I thought this book would not be what I was looking for but just tips on how to make money. But much to my dismay, I found this book to be a great guide to becoming a success person in the business world as well as personally. 

This is a great book that will not teach you how to become a great investor but more importantly what kind of character Warren Buffett was and how his personality traits helped him become one of the greatest businessman and investors. This book was not dry like most autobiographies entail; instead it was anything but that. It had a deep understanding on different aspects of Buffett's life that helped him become the man he is today. It taught many strategies to becoming a good leader and more importantly a team player.  Roger Lowenstein also showed great emphasis on Buffett's childhood and how he was able to think future success to show that he wanted to become successful and have great amounts of wealth. He showed that Buffett was a great man that made morally, ethical decisions to become one of the best investors of all time. 

I definitely recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in Warren Buffett's life. This book is a life long lesson.
