"Swapping Lives" can be added to the list of Green's fantist 'chick-lit' books. While parts are very cliche and a bit repetitive, the book held my interest. In fact, I've only just finished it after starting it about a day ago. It was hard to put down!

The basic story follows single London girl, Vicky, as the magazine she works for sends her over to America. The idea is for Vicky to switch lives with Amber, a supposedly all-American housewife in the Manhattan suburbs. Following along on their adventures was great fun, and Green also added in a few good life lessons.

If you're a fan of Green's books, don't hesitate to buy it! If you're new to the whole 'chick-lit' phenom, get this from your local library and devour it
