   Like his other series The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, these books seem to be of the "light mystery" variety with intriguing and believable characters.  Isabel Dalhousie, the heroine of the series, is a fallible protagonist--a refreshing change from so many heroines.  McCall Smith successfully narrates a woman's perspective by treating it more as a generalized "human" perspective.  
	While the story follows a mystery surrounding a heart-transplant recipient, it explores more universal themes such as the pursuit of love and the assumptions we make about each other, as well as the bonds of friendship. The book is sweet without being saccharine. A worthy read
