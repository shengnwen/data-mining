I gave it only four stars because I was hungry for more. If there are 5,000 books out there about the Beatles, I get the feeling that people begin to grimace at the thought of five-thousand and one coming to the market. Not me. I think, just like books on the Kennedy Assassination, there is one more source out there that can either shed some more important bit of information, and this book does that. Moreover, if you have read alot about the Beatles, it's a verification factor as well, and in part, may even expand upon knowledge or straighten out a rumour here and there. Nothing bad about that. 

Mr. Barrow raises my eyebrows with pieces of information that people like you and me might not be brave enough to bring up at a party with our friends.( You'll have to read that to understand what I mean, far be it for me to give them away.)Perhaps I am a novice when it comes to well known Beatle info, but this book is not only well written, but holds your attention quite well. 

Enjoy.
