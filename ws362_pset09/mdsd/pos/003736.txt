A master-(or should I say mistress- ?)-piece of tragical gloom wrapped up into black, very black English humour. If you manage to survive the flashbacks that densify the gloom, you may see a vague light of hope in the last page. We are all, and have been for more than one or two centuries in Europe, the children of war. Each generation had their war. It's only over the last twenty or thirty years that we haven't had any real state of war, since the end of the last colonial wars in 1962 or so. If you look at a simple family's history over the last four or five generations you find misery, poverty, war, undue death, untimely death, many births and many accidents, lies, lies and lies again, and a lot of make-do, make-believe, more lies to show a shiny front for a coal-black reality. And no one can escape the past. Even if the past is what we take along in life, the past at times is buried out of memory and may come back with a vengeance one day. In other words memory is a diplomatic way of coping with the past by forgetting what we do not need to remember, and yet it will one day come back. The book shows how meaningless the world is, how meaningless human suffering is, and yet it demonstrates that  words are the only thing that can construct a world that makes sense . This is obvious since  sense  or  meaning  can only come from interpretation which is only possible with a communication medium : speech, music, painting, etc. Hence this book is more than a novel. It is the proof that life exists only if we speak of and about it, not to mention the acme of that discourse which comes in writ.
