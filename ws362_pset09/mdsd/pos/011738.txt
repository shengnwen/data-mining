Everyone I ask about this book has never heard of it. I am flabbergasted on why noone has ever read Now in November! This piece of work is beautiful, enchanting and most of all in tune with the human condition. It  goes beyond the usual depiction of the dust bowl era and portrays what it  means to yearn for knowledge and seek out pleasure when it is cruely  restricted. This novel completely deserves a Pulitzer Prize just for the  poetic language alone. Josephine Johnson, girl you should be proud!!
