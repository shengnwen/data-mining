My son received this book as a gift when he was about 5 mo old.  Now, almost a year later, he still loves it!  He is absolutely mesmerized by all of these babies.  The only page that he doesn't seem to like is the "Cry Babies" page, which, of course, shows babies crying.  He quickly moves on to the next page.  All in all, this book is a home run!  Expect to read it over and over and over again
