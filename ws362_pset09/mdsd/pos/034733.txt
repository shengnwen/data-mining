Duckett's biography of King Alfred is an enjoyable and interesting read.  We are drawn a picture of Alfred that shows how great a king he was to overcome the Danes from what little he had left.  Duckett takes us from when he was a boy to his death with a fluid grace not easily found in biographers and their writings.  Additionally, Duckett does well in interpreting the many stories and legends and presenting them in a way to give a real picture of Alfred, one of what really happened and one of what the stories and legends of the time thought of him.  Her short commentaries of the travails that befell the Continent at the hands of the Vikings added a lot of insight and perspective as well.

There did seem to be two chapters out of place.  King Alfred and His Earlier Translations and Later Translations.  Both, it would seem, are important to King Alfred's life since he devoted much of it to translating texts into his native tongue.  But analyzing the meaning of the books as well as the lives of those author's whose books Alfred translated did nothing more than take up space and waste time.  Granted, it is important and would have been a great appendix, but it didn't seem to fit into the style of biography that Duckett wrote.

I, too, as Duckett mentioned at the end, would have liked to have seen some of Alfred's flaws interspersed with his attributes.  But this isn't something that one can find easily, leaving us relying on what is available, notably Asser's rendition of Alfred.  That being said I would definitely recommend this biography to everyone.  If it weren't for the two chapters on translation I would have rated this a five star.

4 stars.
