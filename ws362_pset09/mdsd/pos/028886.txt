Larry Burkett's Managing Money book was wonderfully helpful.  I am a college student and was really struggling with budgeting my money.  By using this book, I was able to really see how my money was being spent,  ways to change my spending habits, and ways to be smart about the money I  have. I would recommend this book to any college students, high school  students, or young adults who are struggling with using their moeny wisely
