If Harvey Pekar didn't write comics and his work was in essay form, I'm sure he would be considered one of the best writers working today.  But, because some people are still afraid to take comics seriously, he has a cult following, made stronger because of the AMERICAN SPLENDOR film.  

OUR MOVIE YEAR is an excellent addition to his work.  It is made up of comics from around the time of the making of the film.  From his first selling the rights, to the various times the production fell through, to the eventual release and acclaim. 

The thing that is so wonderful about Pekar and his comics is just how honest they are.  I mean, a large part of the story are his financial worries, his worrying about if he will be able to sell enough freelance articles to supplement his pension, and if the "buzz" on him will die down after people forget the movie.  Most acclaimed writers wouldn't be so honest.

The collection isn't just about the movie.  There are several biographical pieces on favorite writers and musicians that are wonderful as well.  

It is a must own comic, not just for fans of Pekar, but for anyone who wants to read a wonderful writer.
