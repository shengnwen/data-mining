Written by Sari Solden MS, LMFT, Women With Attention Deficit Disorder is a no-nonsense helpful compendium for women with ADD or ADHD, drawing upon true stories, treatment experiences and histories, and the latest clinical research to provide a plethora of options for improving quality of life. From learning techniques and behaviors to better cope with symptoms - such as planning in advance a course of action to undertake when an ADD attack brings the need to withdraw - to the "MESST" model of Medication, Education, Strategies, Support, and Therapy, to the value of redefining one's self image in a positive light, Women with Attention Deficit Disorder is a "must-read" especially for afflicted women but also filled with valuable insight and practical advice for their friends and loved ones. Highly recommended
