Chapter one covers sentence parts briefly and is useful for anyone who needs a brief grammar refresher. Then the authors explore twenty sentence patterns, including several variations. What I liked most in this book is that after each pattern you will find explanations, examples (including professional samples) and exercises. Pattern layout is simple but effective and will allow you to write almost any sentence in English. All you need to do is to apply these styling patterns to your own sentences
