This is a very interesting book. I fully recommend it to anyone looking for "mystical" answers. You may not agree with everything -- and that's OK. But take whatever you get from this book and simply make it yours. Try it. You may like it. 

Also recommended: "What Did Jesus Really Say, How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information]" by Peter Cayce
