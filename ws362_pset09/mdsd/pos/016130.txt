A good book that explores the Star Wars saga from a Christian perspective without compromising either faithfulness to Christian faith or to the Star Wars cosmology. I was troubled a bit by the many errors in this book---incorrect statements about biblical characters, Star Wars movies, as well as Lord of the Rings.

Another book that follows a similar pathway---though from an angle that's more focused on the creative aspects of Star Wars---is my own _Finding God in a Galaxy Far Far Away_. Both books are definitely worthwhile reads
