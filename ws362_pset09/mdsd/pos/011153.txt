I love the Timothy Freke writings and this book will be awakening to people who have not deeply studied Buddism or Timothy's previous Gnostic slanting books.It is a very small book that uses a page for each paragraph. However let me sum his book up and save you the purchase price:

WE ARE ALL ASLEEP IN THE ILLUSION THAT WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT WE HAVE A BODY AND A MIND AND HAVE THOUGHTS. HOWEVER WE CAN WAKE UP BY REALIZING THAT WE ARE NOT HUMAN WE ARE SIMPLY THE AWARENESS THAT PERCEIVES THE ILLUSION OF US BEING A HUMAN WITH A BODY.THE UNIVERSE IS NOT EXTERNAL, OUR TRUE UNIVERSE IS WHAT THE MIND CREATES FOR OUR AWARENESS THROUGH OUR SENSES.ALL OF OUR REALITY HAPPENS INSIDE OF OUR AWARENESS NOT OUTSIDE.YOUR THOUGHTS,BODY,MIND,BRAIN,SENSES,AND NAME ARE NOT YOU, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT WITNESSES ALL THESE THINGS. WAKE UP!
