Don't be mistaken that this is a complete history. But it does cover most of the major points in American History. Zinn does a good job of filling in some gaps left out of history books most Americans learn about American History from. Zinn tells you up front what his perspective was coming from while writing this book. It is not a main stream perspective but a valid one. It is a bit unbalanced but Zinn said that was his intent so as to add some balance to the volumes of books out there that tend to gloss over American History. Well worth the time and effort no matter what your perspective is on Howard Zinn or American History
