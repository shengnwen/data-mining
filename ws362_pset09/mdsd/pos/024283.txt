I'll be brief.  This book is an outstanding work, reflecting genuine scholarship and wide ranging research.  I found it painful to read.  Why?  The experience is somewhat like seeing O. J. Simpson credibly accused of murdering his ex-wife.  One of the idols of one's youth is shattered before your disbelieving eyes.  But the authors make a convincing case.  

Astronomy and cosmology receive very light treatment. I suppose if you are not aware of the roles of Tycho, Kepler and Copernicus in revolutionizing astronomy, this is not the place to start.  

I think anyone interested in the history of astronomy needs to read this book, but only after one is aware of the larger history of cosmology.         

Why only four stars?  There is a certain lack of coherence that might have been remedied with better editorial review.  In addition conciseness seems to spill over into misstatement in places.
