Second book in the Lear Sisters trilogy.

Set in Austin, Texas, Rebecca Lear has been a daughter, a wife, a mother and a Miss Texas.  Now divorced, raising her five year old son and wanting to find a job, Rebecca has no skills and no confidence.  She's not getting any job offers and her prospects look bleak.

Then a state senator who's running for lieutenant governor calls and asks her to be part of his campaign.  Rebecca agrees hoping to increase her "work" experience.  The senator has also asked Matt Parrish, a very successful Austin lawyer.  Matt agrees to join the senator's campaign to get inside knowledge for a possible run at the DA's office.  Matt sincerely tries to help the underdog but his law partner wants him to take more *money* cases.

When Rebecca and Matt meet, sparks fly.  Matt thinks she's an airhead (not true) and ignorant about politics (true).  Rebecca thinks he's arrogant (true) and ego-driven (not true).  Good story, some laugh out loud moments.  I liked BEAUTY QUEEN more than the first book, MATERIAL GIRL.
