This is one of the most viscerally exciting political / philosophical books in history.  You can't help but be swept up by the force of Vaneigem's appeals... and though one may not assent to all of his positions or specific interpretations, all in all you will have to say that he had managed to tap into something very true.  

read it, ponder it... and get out and live.  you have nothing to lose but your boredom
