I read Jenny McCarthy's "Baby Laughs" recently - and my baby hasn't even been born yet!  I had such a good time reading "Belly Laughs" when I first became pregnant that I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one!

I am sure some of this is exaggeration, but I've no doubt much of it is incredibly close to the truth.  True to form, Jenny rarely holds back, though it seems she has watered down her humor a touch, as compared to Belly Laughs.  Despite the seemingly terrifying moments and exhaustion she describes experiencing, there is no doubt she LOVES being a mom, and will make any new mom reading this look forward to experiencing the same all the while laughing out loud.  I definitely recommend this to all new mommies and mommies-to-be
