I believe Al Reis is one of the most important contributors to the principles of marketing as we know. I read this book and his other book about Laws of Marketing years ago. I still think the ideas in these books are timeless. I still browse them from time to time to refresh my memory. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to be a businessman or successful in their careers. I believe it is a neccessity to learn about the principles of branding and marketing in today's business world wether you are in marketing, advertising or finance. Easy to read, great to learn.
