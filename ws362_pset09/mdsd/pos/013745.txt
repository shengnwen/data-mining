About 1 out of every 2 baseball biographies seems to be about a Yankee.  As a Yankee Hater, I loath that.  However, I was at the library and decided to try The Big Bam by Leigh Montville.
I was very pleasantly surprised.  This book is very balanced and very informative.  The author shows you Babe's personal side, while retaining all the baseball information and recapping we love to absorb.
The reader gets a view into Ruth's fog enshrouded upbringing,parents, and marriages.  We see how the Babe was a babe well into his twenties because of his difficult and deprived childhood.  How he couldn't stop drinking (soda or booze), eating, or fornicating because all these things were withheld from him for so long.  We sympathize as baseball's greatest player is never given a chance to manage and often because of his naiviety is taken advantage of.
So Yankee lovers and Yankee haters, pick up this book.  I would've liked to give this book 4.5 stars, because it barely falls short of 5. It is very, very, good.  We Yankee Haters can once again curse Henry Frazee for selling the Babe (the best left-handed pitcher) to the despised Yankees.  You Yankee lovers can revel in your great fortune, as your formerly mediocre team now rules the roost
