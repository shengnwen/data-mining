Well I loved this book. I am scratching my head over some of the reviews. I liked the fact that it wasn't too gory because I'm not really into that. I am always attracted to King's fascinating premises but I am not keen on the gross out factor.
This book presents a stunning believable supernatural other world connected to our own. It has an explanation about the way death works.
The characters are very believable.
Unfortunately the begining and middle are so fantastic that the ending comes as an anticlimax but it is still worth reading
