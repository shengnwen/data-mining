This delightful confection of a book begins exactly where "16 LIghthouse Road" left off. Again, we are privy to the secrets and private desires of the residents of Cedar Cove, WA. But this is no "Desperate Housewives," it's more of a modern, updated version of a fabulous fifties fairytale, where no matter how tough the problem or how unsurmountable the barriers, very nice people find their way to love and happiness in the end.

What's wrong with that? Nothing! Macomber has such a sweet, winsome way of writing, that the reader willingly suspends reality and gets caught up in the characters' lives--hoping for the happy ending that almost always comes.

In this book, we move into the very interesting life of Grace Sherman, whose husband of 35 years, Dan, mysteriously disppeared in Book One. What happened to him? Has he really run away with another woman as Grace thinks? Her daughter Kelly is still holding a candle for her father, even though she now has a family of her own; her daughter Maryellen is defiantly manless. But everybody in the Sherman family is suffering from not knowing the truth.

We also get to know more about newsman Jack, who is still pursuing Olivia the judge. And what's up with Justine, Olivia's daughter, who persists in dating an unsavory land developer?

All these plots and more wind their way enthrallingly through this book. Highly recommended for those days when you just want a book to take you away from it all.
