Sure, Tolstoy is a very good writer but it's a stretch to try and claim that AK is the "best novel ever written." I found it unfocused and slow in developing a plot. O.k., part of that is just the style of the writing of the time but that's not a complete excuse. 

Personally, I think Dostoyevsky is a better and more interesting writer. Tolstoy is a classic, and I respect him for that, but don't assume he's great just because people (including Oprah) tell you so..
