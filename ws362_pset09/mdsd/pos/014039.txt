The value of this book is not for its groundbreaking concepts (as no individual concept is overly insightful) as many reviewers have implied, but rather for the framework it provides.  Almost all of Porter's main points are patently obvious to a modestly educated reader (e.g., a firm can compete on either charging a lower price or if it doesn't charge a lower price, it must make a differentiated/better product).  Most points made in this book do not go much deeper than that, and any given reader would intuitively know any isolated strategy that Porter lays out without reading his book.  However, the book is great not in that it will change your thoughts/intuitions, but in that it will give you a well-structured overall framework for analyzing competitive strategy holistically.  In other words, it combines fairly obvious conclusions/intuitions into one overarching strategic overview.

Most readers have noted the value that business managers can obtain by studying the text, but I can also see a lot of value that investors analyzing industries, or an individual company's position in an industry can get out of the book
