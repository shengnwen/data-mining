I bought this book because the movie "Wedding Date" was a great "girly" Movie!  And I love them!!!  The book started a bit slow...maybe, I had to adjust to the British culture...but then I was soooo into it!  At various points I was laughing very loudly!! A great fun book!  I loved the banter and "Play" between Sophy and Josh.  Can't wait to read another book by Elizabeth Young!!!  And I'm passing the book along to my younger sister!  She'll love it as much as I did
