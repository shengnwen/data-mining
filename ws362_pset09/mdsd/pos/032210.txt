I really do not belong to the analytical school of philosophy, being more into what is known as continental philosophy. Still, I have to highly reccomend this book for both theists and atheists alike. For theists, it will help strengthen some of your beliefs, while force you to think about other beliefs you hold. For atheists, it will do something similar, though it will obviously challenge more than it affirms. The greatest strength of this book, however, is that the articles are not all easy, nor are they all so difficult that only a person who's a master of esosteric terminology can grasp it. The essays range from easy (such as Advice to Christian Philosophers, as well as his treatment on the problem of evil) all the way to very challenging (his essay on Ockhams way out is one of the most challenging things I've read to date). In summary, Plantinga is one of the leading Christian thinkers today, and it would benefit everyone to read some of his writings, if for nothing else than to get a different (Christian) point of view
