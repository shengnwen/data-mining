Bonnie Bernell's Bountiful Women is a delicious and nourishing volume. Organized into bite-sized chapters, the book presents stories and illustrations on a myriad of topics - from core issues, such as health care and personal relationships, to life enhancement arenas, such as travel and personal pampering. As the bountiful women tell their stories, they reveal their wisdom, courage, humor, compassion, and tenacity. Celebrating each women's individuality, Bernell does not advocate  &quot;one size fits all&quot; in her commentary and advice. Rather she writes about choices, the choices that should be available to all women, as she advocates against self-imposed limitations that narrow our lives, demean us, or wither our spirits. Fundamentally this book is about the quality of our lives, about &quot;deservingness.&quot; While the focus is on bountiful women, Bountiful Women speaks to all women. It provides food for thought; more importantly, it offers a deep well of sustenance for the heart
