I gave Hatchet four stars because it is a great survival story, which has awesome details. If you love survival stories you would love this because he is stranded in the middle of the Canadian forest with no supplies. He had no supplies because his plane sunk on his way to see his dad.

A part I liked was when he feels like a survivor not a city boy. As a city boy he was use to get things he wanted. But as a survivor Brian wasn't so selfish and thought more about his actions.  

The part I didn't like was the gruesome details which there weren't a lot of them. And that's the only thing I didn't like in hatchet.

                    Do you think he will survive?
