If I had to give these short stories a grade, it would have to be a B. However one of the stories, the "Lamia in the Cevernnes" is really wonderful and creepy.

The volume of short stories, "The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye" also had uneven quality but contained one of the finest novellas in the English lanuage, the piece from which the volume gets its name.

I sometimes think of A.S. Byatt as the writter of adult fairy stories or folk tales. The story, Lamia in the Cevernnes, certainly fits this description. It is the story of a painter, escaping conservative England to the remote countryside of France. His swimming pool seems to have a spoiled odor and ichy color, so he drains it and fills it with river water. However he has unknowingly captured a river spirit. This spirit, the Lamia, gradually makes herself known to him. First she appears as an underwater shadow, then as a caress from an invisible force under the water, then as a more distinct ghosty image, and then finally she reveals herself to the artists. She is a giant colorful snake-like creature with the eyes and mouth and teeth of a human. She asks for a kiss and promises untold fortune. Byatt describes the gradual approach of the Lamia to the artist with such creepy skill that she made my skin crawl. We have all felt the underwater touch of an invisible hand. We have all seen a glimpse of some underwater spirit, now visible, now gone, that makes the hair stand up on your head. Byatt captures this sensation so very well with her amazing craft.

Not as complex as her novels, but insightful well-crafted tales, her short story collections always contain at least one tale that hits me at the animal instinctual level
