I recently started an adult beginning ballet class with no dance experience whatsoever.  (I have done sports and aerobics.)  I bought this book as a beginner-level reference, and it has been very helpful.  It was right-on in terms of what to wear and what to expect.  It does a good job of trying to answer every beginner-type question and allay every worry that might crop up.  The book also covers ballet etiquette and culture (slightly preachy at times).  I go back to it after class to get more details about what was done or said during class eg what exactly did she mean by 'attitude' and what did she mean when she said her leg was 'sickling'?.  The book also offers useful tips.  To top it off, the photographs are very nice, and the layout and type are easy on the eyes.  In sum, helpful, and a pleasure to read and look at
