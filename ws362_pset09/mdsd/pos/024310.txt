Barna here provides a good intro on the lack of evangelism in today's churches.  For anyone who has read much on the subject, Barna really doesn't share anything new.  What he does do however, is to put many of the trends and concepts together in one volume.

There are certainly better books on the market describing specific methods of "evangelism that works." This title just identifies the problem in American churches today -- we are falling far short of communicating the gospel of Christ with a lost and dying culture. For an introduction to the challenges of evangelism in the 21st century, this book is fine.  For a description of specific evangelistic techniques God is using today, many other works would be better
