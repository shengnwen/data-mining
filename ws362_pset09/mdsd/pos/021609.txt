The book is well sectioned into a broad, comprehensive range of topics from the war, technology, management, culture, world trade, etc. I found his approach to setting up in the US interesting (very non-Japanese).

The writing style keeps the reader's interest, although the  vacillation between formal and colloquial ("flunked") reflects the fact that two ghost writers were used - one American, one Japanese.

Overall, a good autobiography well written, comprehensive, with broad appeal to the leader, technologist, international businessman and the politician.
