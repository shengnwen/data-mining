Everything I have made so far has been incredible. The chocolate cheesecake recipe has to be the best cheesecake recipe in existence.  However, you'd have to have a mighty big bread machine to make the recipes which say they can be made in a bread machine.   So that technique hasn't worked for me, there was so much dough it really gummed up my machine.  Otherwise, wow!!
