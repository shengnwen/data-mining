I got this book a long time ago.  I have read it twice.  Both times I've had to sleep with the lights on for days afterwards.  Not since Vincent Price and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more talented Master of Fright.  I have been terrified of this man since childhood.  Each story in this book will have you hiding under the covers.  This man has talent to spare.  I think you should read this book.  Just make sure you have fresh bulbs in your light fixtures, you'll need them to ward off the demons Stephen is sure to unleash.
