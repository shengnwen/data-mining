Once you get used to the broken English of Delores Caliborne, you can really get into this book.  I'll admit I was a bit skeptical at first having just read Gerald's Game (which came out right before this and is briefly linked during the solar eclipse scene) and thinking to myself "Oh, Jesus, another chick book by Steve-O! What's he thinking?"  Well...Delores Claiborne is a chick book, and she is one tough chick.  Not a horror novel at all (that shouldn't worry any real Stephen King afficionado, anyway) Delores Claiborne is a rambling auto-biography of a salt-of-the-earth, tough-as-nails housekeeper who killed off her husband 30 some odd years ago.  This is a trip into the human psyche.  A brilliant character sketch.  This is Stephen King showing us why he is one of the greatest writers of all time.  Story.  Pure and simple.  Ayuh.
