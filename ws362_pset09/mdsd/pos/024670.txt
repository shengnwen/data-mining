I don't read "The Cat Who..." books for mystery or thrills. I read them for their charm and warmth, to visit old friends again, to walk down the streets of Pickax and browse the shops, to admire Quill's reserved intelligence and thoughtfulness, and to play with Yum Yum and Koko as they race up and down the ramps in the apple barn. By that measure, "The Cat Who Went Bananas" is a wonderful and thoroughly enjoyable addition to Braun's series.

Some reviewers have criticized the ending as vague or unclear, but I found it more realistic than endings where everything is wrapped up neatly. In real life, nothing is wrapped up neatly. If you view these books as character studies of idealized small town life, then the ending was more appropriate, more fitting, and more satisfying.

If you're looking for a comfortable, cozy reunion with your friends in Moose County, you'll enjoy this book
