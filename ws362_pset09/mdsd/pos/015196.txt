I saw Reichheld speak at a Shop.org conference, liked his talk, bought the book, read it, and really liked it.

I'm posting this review because I *didn't* get the book thru Bzzagent.

Since some of negative customer reviews here point out the irony that Reichheld used Bzzagent to promote the book (I'd say, "and so what?").

In the spirit of the book, I'm a satisfied customer (buyer and reader) of this book, and I'd recommend it highly
