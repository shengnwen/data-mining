The novel captures the cadence of West Indian speech, view of the world, and our initial contact with  England in the 1950. The stories appear funny, and they are, but underneath there are vivid descriptions of the  hardship and the bewilderment that faced poor immigrants unaccustomed to  vivid racism, cold weather, and homesickness. The survival of the  characters makes the novel and gem. You will never look at the pidgeons in  Trafalgar Sq. the same way
