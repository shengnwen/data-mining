Many have written extensive reviews on this book that I believe are accurate.  Using the relevant decision research, the authors have successfully produced this accessible guide.  The book is a practical introduction to decisions for anyone interested in approaching problems in business and life in a structured manner.  While footnotes do not appear, related research confirms the validity of the authors' methods.  For an introduction into the research, I recommend the Harvard Business Review on Decision Making from the HBS Press that includes a paper by the authors detailing the even swap method. 

My only criticism is the compressed feel of the text particularly in the "Uncertainty" and "Linked Decisions" chapters.  For most of the book, the authors did an outstanding job of condensing a great deal of information into a flowing, informative book.
