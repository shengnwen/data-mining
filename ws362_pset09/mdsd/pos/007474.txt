I can't remember the last time I connected so deeply with a character. I wanted to wrap Sticky in my arms and take care of him. I absolutely love this book. de la Pena's writing is passionate, it's raw, it's real and full of life. We follow Sticky through adolescence and witness his struggles, his loves (mother, basketball, girlfriend...), his pain and hopes and dreams. de la Pena weaves through past and present seamlessly. He has created a novel with great depth and rich characters. I didn't want it to end.
Sticky may have started out "three stones back", but you leave with hope that he's going to be all right
