This book reads more like a collection of short stories.  The book covers the first assent of Denali, first winter accent of Denali, first solo accent of Denali, and several other interesting or note worthy asscents.  If you have read and enjoyed the book &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;  then you should enjoy this book. The book is very enjoyable reading
