This is a tremendously informative book.  Densly packed with info, and a fascinating read.  My only complaint is that, since chapters were contributed by different writers, there's no style that really permeates the book.  The chapter on Techno, for example, does a great job at contextualizing the Detroit sound, pointing out the influences that led to the evolution of techno, from a musical perspective, as well as from a social and even economic perspective.  Unfortunately not all chapters are written the same way.  The chapter on House, for example, is a bit dizzying for readers unfamiliar with the sounds and beats being described.  But nevertheless... READ IT.  (And Dance to it, more importantly!
