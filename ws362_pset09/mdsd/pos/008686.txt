This is such a lovely book, it's worth owning just to look at the beautiful photographs of roses.  However, it offers much more.  There are full descriptions of each rose, including origin, developer, growth, fragrance, etc.  I needed to find a rose developed in Germany.  Using this book I created quite a long list of potential roses.  When I located a grower of the rose I wanted, it was interesting to see this book prominently displayed among his reference works.  Highly recommended
