author presents a less than hopeful view of humanity's survival unless drastic steps, political and economic,are recognized and embraced.  When read along with viewing the recent (summer 2006) movie, "An Inconvenient Truth" I came away discouraged.  However, I may just be reflecting an old man's view that, "the world is going to .... etc").   However, I do NOT subscribe to literalist view of biblical end of times theology
