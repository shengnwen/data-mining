This is the first installment in a series that looks to have a long life ahead of it. The topic has been done in various ways before, including Pat Frank's 1940s "Mr. Adam": through some cataclysm, all men on earth are incapacitated or (as here) killed. All but one - Y, Yorick, bearer of the last Y chromosome on earth. Second to last, if you count his unaccountably live (and male) pet monkey.

And we're off. It's a Mad Max world of social collapse. Fragments of the old order try to maintain some semblance of sanity, despite the roving cult/gangs that control parts of the landscape. And, like Mad Max, vehicles and fuel become critical trade goods. That's the setting in which Yorick, agent 355, and a cloning specialist set off - one step behind the answer, and one step ahead of the warlords and international hit squads chasing them. But what about the mysterious ring and amulet?

This first book serves largely to set the scene, define the characters, and get the action started. And it's off to a good start. This has all the makings of a very enjoyable and long-lived adventure series, and I'm coming back for more.
