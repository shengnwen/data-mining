This was an interesting book, but not a very pleasurable read. I guess it depends on what types of stories you like to read. The story, plot were exciting; however after reading the book, I came away wondering about the author's views on women. EJD is a very talented writer.  He tells the story from a first person point of view; however women are not portrayed in a positive light. The women seem to be oversexed and immature, with no rooting or grounding. The characters are very insecure and mixed up. Although I would have preferred to see women in the story portrayed in a more positive light, I must say that EJD has done a wonderful job of telling a story.
