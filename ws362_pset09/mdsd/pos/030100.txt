There's usually this weird attitude with games where we need to beat it on our own sans cheat devices or strategy guides/FAQ's. Well when you're dealing with an RPG, it tends to help to have one. So one of the biggest RPG's ever has to have a strategy guide and the one for Final Fantasy VII is quite good although like others said some problems.

The book of course has a walkthrough of the game start to finish including tips about bosses, items you may have missed and things to look out for. It's good but you kind of wish there was a full boss blowout since it just mentions the strategy involved. What about recommended party level? The book tends to spoil a lot too such as the big one at the end of Disc I and one of the characters finding himself in Disc 2.

After the walkthrough is secrets and sidequests such as getting a Gold Chocobo, tips for the Battle Arena and getting everyone's Ultimate Weapons and Limit Breaks. An old magazine named EGM2(later renamed Expert Gamer) had a guide on the game and they explained the Gold Chocobo thing better than this did. Also a secret involving a library in Shinra Headquarters I'm reading and it's like "ok, what?"

There is some grammatical errors and such but it's usually nothing to get upset about. It's not like he says one item is somewhere but then you find something else. After those there is a beastality(not that kind) where it details all the enemies in the game. Afterwards is a map of the world.

It does help with the game if you're stuck but there will be times where the book spoils you or you're told something in a bit poor grammar but oh well
