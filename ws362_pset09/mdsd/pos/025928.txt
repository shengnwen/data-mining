It is impossible to make responsible decisions without decent information. I found this book both readable and extremely informative. On the other hand, it is so filled with information that is a call to awareness of the global crisis facing us that I needed to put it down periodically to avoid depression and/or extreme cynicism. Still, it is an important book to read and I do make better decisions on a daily basis because of it. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who feels that they want to know what's actually going on and doesn't want to be hit with the coming crisis blindsided
