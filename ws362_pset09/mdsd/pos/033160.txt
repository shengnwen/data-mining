My 7 year old has come across this book in his school library and asked to have his own copy.  It is also one of my favourites.

Edward is not content with being just an Emu, so he tries being every other animal in the zoo, a different one every night.  The book describes the different animals in the zoo and a candidly human emu.  Edward reminds me of a few people I know, and of myself sometimes, switching between cages to be something different every so often.

It is a thoroughly entertaining book and the pictures are extremely funny to look at
