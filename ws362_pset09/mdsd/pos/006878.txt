I have almost finished building the summerhouse  in Garden Retreats.  It overlooks a bay where swan , ducks and other birds come over every day to watch my progress.  This has been one of the most gratifying projects I  have ever attempted.  It has been time consuming, but worth it.  I have  even put in electric as suggested in the book.  I highly recommend this  book and this project.  Once I got the summerhouse enclosed, I could trim  out the interior and it was plenty warm inside the space.  I can't wait  until summer when I can sit inside the summerhouse and watch the sun go  down
