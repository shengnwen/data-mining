It may seem like an exageration to say that a book about advertising fundamentally changed the way I view the world... but it did (and 9 out of ten dental hygenists agree).  Anyways, this book is sensational.  It give  an interesting historical overview, and then goes on to analyze the way  advertising has shaped modern society.  I'm going to read all of Mr.  Twitchell's books.  He is a really clever and witty writer, and obviously  has some great insights on modern culture.  Plus, this book has lots of  pictures of the ads/trends he discusses-- this is a real asset to the text
