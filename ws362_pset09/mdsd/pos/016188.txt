This book is not only very informative and well written but also manages to be reasonably impartial on some of the hottest issues in international relations. The tone chances slightly when Pelham takes over from Mansfield but this is also when we approach the present time. I appreciated the fact that criticism is not one-sided as undoubtedly the Israel-vs-Palestinians problem cannot be summarized by placing all blame on any one side. In fact, I found the exposition more balanced and less negative against Israel than I was expecting from somebody who studied arabic in Damascus and is currently living in Jordan.
Perhaps the Pelham portion would deserve only 4 stars but the rest of the book would be 5+. I would have appreciated a few more and more informative maps but an overall 5 is well deserved.
