I missed the memo about Douglass Coupland and David Eggers being in some kind of a professional wrestling match over who's a better writer, so you'll have to forgive me for not making references to it. Many of the other reviews seem to have lots of information on said competition, so check those if you're interested.

All comparisons to other (similar?) authors aside, this is a great book, and I don't feel the same "pretension" coming from it as some other reviewers do. I feel that the insinuation that Coupland had somehow planned, while writing this book, to actually name this generation and ride the ensuing media wave borderline insane. Nobody could plan that.

This novel is full of interesting little stories, some better than others, told by three young adults trying to escape the usual routine most of their contemporaries live in by dwelling in modest homes in the California Desert. It's easy to relate, if you've grown up in similar conditions, to their frustration with the materialism, shallowness, and information-saturatedness of the modern world, and their desire to break free of it -- and ESPECIALLY their inability to figure out how to satisfy that desire.

Sure, there's not much in the way of a plot, but the characters and ideas more than compensate for that deficiency. I couldn't really see these characters doing anything particularly plot-driven, like hunting down a buried treasure, anyway.

I was also amused by the definitions of terms sprinkled throughout the pages of the book (Metaphasia: An inability to percieve metaphor).

All-in-all, a good read, if not life-changing. If you go in without expecting some massive revelation based on the author having coined the term Generation X, you can expect to be satisfied
