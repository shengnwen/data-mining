I saw an ad on GOLF channel for the DVD ($100) while on vacation. I bought the book immediately on my return. I first read many of these reviews. They come from different knowledge and experience levels analogous to the 1 and 2 plane swing differences. I discovered that my woods were more 1-plane and my irons more 2-plane (actually 3-plane due to a hitch at the top). So, if I tried a tip for all my clubs my woods or irons, one would improve while the other would deteriorate. Now I know why. The next 2 weeks in my after-work league I tried to stick with only the 1-plane swing for all my clubs. My game was shorter by half a club, but more consistently playable. I shot my best 2 scores this year (by 3 strokes--it's a nine hole league), and it should have been even 2 better except for a bad putting day.

I agree that after differentiating between the two types of swings and helping the reader determine which they have (or want), it would be clearer if everything about one swing would be placed together, followed by everything about the other. The current layout makes you work for the information pertinent to the path you choose to follow. Regardless, a great insight and help to me. (P.S. I might now try 1-plane for woods and 2-plane for irons again--but with the understanding of what applies to each.
