Since the beginning of Christianity, Our Blessed Lord and His Mother have favored a select few people with special revelations containing information on their lives that is not to be found anywhere else. This inspiring work blends all the magnificent visions granted to four of the most privileged souls in the history of the Church. Raphael Brown has compiled an unforgettable masterpiece on the life of Our Lady by combining the writings from Ven. Anne Catherine Emmerich, Ven. Mary of Agreda, St. Bridget of Sweden and St. Elizabeth of Schoenau. The wonderful mental pictures obtained from this enthralling narration will so impress you that they will stay with you the rest of your life. These images can't help but enhance our understanding of the New Testament and our love for Jesus, Mary and Joseph which is why the Church allows and encourages the circulation of these writings. Perhaps just as important as the telling of Mary's life according to these famous mystics is the most valuable explanation included on how the Church deals with the contradictions on historical details that sometimes occur in writings of people who receive private revelations
