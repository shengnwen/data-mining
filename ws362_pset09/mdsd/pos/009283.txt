My major interest in Norm Stamper's "Breaking Rank" is his conclusion that drugs have made a mess of police work. (Stamper was the former Deputy Chief in San Diego, Chief in Seattle, and lost his position as a result of police rampaging during the WTO meeting in 2000.) He favors not just decriminalization, but legalization of ALL drugs. He sees a parallel in the Prohibition experience - which obviously didn't work and led to an increase in crime against both citizens and police.

Meanwhile, Stamper claims that huge increases in prison populations from 139 per 100,000 residents in 1980 to 482 per 100,000 in 2003) were mainly for drug convictions. By 2003, 1,678,200 were arrested for drugs - more than for murder, manslaughter, forcible rape and aggravated assault combined. Now, under President Bush we have even prohibited marijuana use by those ill with cancer and glaucoma.

Similarly Stamper argues for the legalization of prostitution, and condemns Seattle's former chief for spousal abuse (Stamper was abused as a child and had a number of run-ins with the law as a teenager.)

Stamper also confesses to being a bully when he first started policing, drinking confiscated brew at San Diego Police headquarters with other officers, and working as an undercover spy during the days of radical students. Stamper also claims to have witnessed officers having sex with a teenage police Explorer, tossing ethnic slurs, beating homosexuals, falsifying reports to "meet quotas," etc.
