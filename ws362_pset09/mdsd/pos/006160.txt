Great read- I laughed, cried, and worried - and was suprised.
I caught part of a TV interview with M K Andrews and heard enough
to order the book. I related to the setting because I am from the 
SE United States. It was so much fun quickly turning each page
that I ordered all three of her other books after I closed the
back cover of this one
