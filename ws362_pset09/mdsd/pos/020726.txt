In case you don't trust all of the other reviewers, allow me to interject my praise for Hughart's World Fantasy Award winning first novel. Here are my adjectives: uproarious, delightful, imaginative, and sentimental (in a good way). Master Li and Number Ten Ox's romp through mystical China is sly, adventurous, and worth reading more than once. I read somewhere that the publishing bureaucracy irritated Hughart so much that he stopped writing, and that's a shame. More Master Li and Number Ten Ox is exactly what the genre needs right now.
