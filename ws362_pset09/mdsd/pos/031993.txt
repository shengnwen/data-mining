I agree with Mr. Wiggin on most all points. The only difference I have is that value (yes, even the value of gold) must be looked at from the standpoint of perpetual (sustainable?) NEED. When people are starving in the streets of the near future, gold won't do them any good if there is no food to be had. The real threat is not to our 'investments', but to our future as a race or a country when our people's needs can no longer be met. The grand idea of the invisible hand is fine in fiat worlds like the stock market or the economy which is functioning reasonably normally, but when the economy goes down the broken sewer tubes, the invisible hand won't even be able to operate a plunger.
The problem with overextended debt isn't necessarily that something is owed, but that we have too many people owing too much based on expensive tastes for things that destroy their own species' future. Fine, a few of our generation can invest in gold or commodities and make a killing as everyone is killing each other. That takes care of our lifetimes, but THEN what? 
The real lie is the lie of Competition vs. the logic of Cooperation and Reduction. We have established our dominance over Nature, now we can start thinking about how to cooperate with each other instead of competing for little green pieces of paper.
Just as the real solution to health insurance costs is to get rid of insurance and (most) drugs, the real solution to economics is to get rid of economists and most banks
