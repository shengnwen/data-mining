I got this book a week ago and have read it from cover to cover. Out of hundreds of recipes, I think I might try 30 of them. Some stuff is too "out there" for my fiancee (I'll try anything) or I just can't locate some of the ingredients (been trying to find fresh sardines and salt packed anchovies online for months now...my local fishmonger never has them). The only glaring ommissions that I hoped (and assumed after watching his show religiously for several years) are recipes for a legit, real Italian artisan bread (or several varities) and same for killer pizza dough. Even with the ommissions, I enjoy the simplicity of the recipes and his commentary, which is as fascinating to read as his on-air comments.
