I echo what most of the reviewers said: The book is absolutely on target in recommending using low-cost passive index funds. The book is wrong in its recommendation of essentially paying all of the $$ thereby saved to a financial advisor (who typically takes 1% of your money a year for doing nothing--that's $10,000 on a million $).

I would just like to add that of the better and more concise books out there, I liked Bogle's "Common Sense on Mutual Funds" the best. Better presentation, clearer, less hiding behind zillions of academic studies
