I had to use Boadt's book for 1st semester scripture in 2004, and have since used this book in my own research into the Old Testament. A marvellous work that touches on a host of topics, such as the Documentary Hypothesis, multiple authorship of Isaiah, Daniel as a psuedipigraphia, and so forth.

This is one book that must be on the book shelf of all scripture aficinados everywhere
