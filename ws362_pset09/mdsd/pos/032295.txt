This book is an excellent addition to my collection of pottery books.  This book deals with the more technical side of pottery.  This book is for people who have accomplished throwing but want to take it to the next  level.  The book covers everyhting from history of pottery, to correct  proportions, and also has artist bio's.  Excellent book, i rate it 12 out  of 10
