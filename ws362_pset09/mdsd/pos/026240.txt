"All archetypes have "shadow" manifestations as well as positive aspects." ~Caroline Myss

After discovering Caroline Myss and her work in the areas of Self-Esteem, I took an interest in other areas of her research. While Archetypes, Sacred Contracts and Chakras may be foreign territory for many of us, these ideas can be rather enlightening. 

I first discovered Chakras while doing a yoga video called "Yoga Zone Flexibility and Stress Release" and was amazed at how healed I was just after imagining colors in various areas of my body. 

The "Journal of Inner Dialogue" is divided into three main sections: 

Sacred Contracts
Archetypes
Chakras

Caroline uses questions to encourage you to examine your inner motivations, strengths, fears, energy blocks and challenges. She believes you made a sacred contract before you were born and this determines what you will learn in your life. While I can't validate this information myself, it is intriguing. 

Since this is a journal-style book, you will find plenty of lined sheets for your own writing. You can fill in answers to questions, fill in sacred contract sheets or explore each chakra in depth. The ring binding and cover are of high quality and this book is quite beautiful and has a linen-textured earthy olive green lining and even a pocket on the inner front cover. 

If you purchase this item, do consider the Caroline Myss Archetype Cards. I found them to be essential when discovering your archetypes. A book explaining the Archetypes is also included in the box of cards.
