This book is the sequel to Silver's Edge, and it was a great follow-up. 

There is a short synopsis of the previous book at the beginning of this one, then it plunges right in where we left off.  I thought that the characters, especially a couple of the male ones, were more fleshed out in this book than in the last.  Artimour became a real person and not a cardboard figure.  I agree with one reviewer who said that a few things seemed out of character.  Vinaver's actions for one, and the villains (i.e. Timias) didn't produce as much conflict as I would have liked.

I really liked the way that the romance developed more in this book.  And so you know - there were at least a couple fairly graphic sex scenes - but nothing seemed gratuitous.  

As I wrote in my earlier review, I really enjoy the way the author weaves a Celtic-feeling fairy story, with Celtic myths and Celtic culture.  The whole story and conflict is built on a sort of Celtic/pagan-religious way of looking at the universe.  It's nice and different.

My only complaints would be that this should have been a trilogy!  The book wrappd up pretty quickly, and if it had been longer the villains could have had more time to work more mischief and prolong the tension.  As it was, there were some surprising sad parts, but it still could have been drawn out longer
