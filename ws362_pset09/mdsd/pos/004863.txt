In this second of her Christmas parables, Anne Perry chooses to focus on Henry Rathbone, a minor character in her Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series. The book is short and easy to read. The mystery itself is somewhat confusing-- the issue regarding the date of property deeds took my slow little mind a while to catch on, but by the end I understood everything. If you are looking for a happy ending, you won't find it with this book, but the ending is a surprise and is a good morality tale. I have a feeling that in real life, it wouldn't quite end as simply as Ms. Perry would have it, but then, it is fiction
