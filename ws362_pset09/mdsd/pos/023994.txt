I read this book after having many random health symptoms that were similar to Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia/Exhaustion. My condition was bad to the point that I lost my job and was unemployed for about 6 months. I felt like I was in a fatigued, achy fog all of the time.

The information in the first part of this book is very helpful. It not only tells how the Standard American Diet (SAD) is a major culprit of disease and death in our society, but it offers science- and research-based insight into the practical steps toward wellness...God's way. It also takes you through Jordan's amazing story of disease and recovery.

I actually did the Maker's Diet 40 day program after reading this book. I took most of the supplements, and yes, they were expensive (like any other natural whole-food based supplements are). I also ate USDA organic produce, meat, grains and dairy from Whole Foods Market...again, expensive. But worth it!

Since then, I've continued to eat organic food, making sure I eat plenty of raw fruits and vegetables, as well as a balanced variety of meat, grains, and dairy. Since last year, I've recovered a WHOLE lot, with the help of this book, other resources, my diet and lifestyle changes, and taking a FEW key supplements daily.

The Bottom Line: This book doesn't have all the answers, but it offers a solid foundation of common sense diet principles. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn and apply the amazing benefits of a truly traditional diet.
