I really enjoy Landsburg's style of writting.  His many numerous examples of how to apply economics to everyday life are humerous, interesting, and instructive.  However, I'm not a complete beginner to economics and I'd already heard or read many of the examples he gave which took away from a lot of the fun in reading the book.

In addition, as I am a scientist doing research a major university trying to develop new theories to explain how to engineer better catalysts I must state that I didn't agree with his explanation of why some scientists produce more theories than others, etc.  He didn't seem to believe that it was difficult to develop new original scientific theories which I strongly disagree with, and so I lowered my rating of the book from 5 to 4 stars.

If you're new to economics then buy the book.  It's great!  But if you've been around the block a few times, you'll probably find it a bit boring
