This is an incredibly well-written and inspiring book - an amazing testament to the intelligence, depth, and humanity of both the subject and the authors alike.  Tarski's life, told interwoven with the glistening tales of his bright-eyed hopeful graduate students, friends, foes, and lovers, unfolds in such a way as to make those of us on the cusp of our graduate studies hark for an environment as rich with character dynamic and passion.  With excelent, accessible technical notes interspersed throughout the work, this book is a wonderful read for anyone involved in mathematics.  Even so, this book is much more than a story written for logicians and mathematicians.  This is a book with themes so distinctly human and reaching as to make the whole story accessible and inspirational for anyone who might get his or her hands on it.  I cannot recommend it enough.  If Paul Hoffman's biography on Erdos ("The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: Paul Erdos and the Search for Mathematical Truth") made me want to study mathematics and logic as an undergraduate, the Fefermans' "Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic" made me want to devote my graduate studies to the subjects.  Inspiring, indeed
