This novel incorporates numerous issues that happened in the life of this African-American woman. In her life she deals with racism in her community, naming, sexual abuse, and acceptance. She learns to cope with the life she lives. Her experiences in the novel are ones that many people (not only women) can relate to. In the novel, Maya struggles to find who she really is. Since she has so much influence around her she doesnt know who she really is. I would recommend this novel to any person who wants to find themselves. This novel has impacted my life, and it can impact your too
