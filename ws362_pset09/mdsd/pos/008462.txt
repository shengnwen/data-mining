Tony Hawks worst attribute, as expressed in this book, is a tendency to fall into the clichés of believing total drunken stupers to be somehow acts of bravado and manliness. He's not the first and won't be the last to do this. That's what makes it a cliché. However, that aside, this is a great read fro anyone who enjoys travel in general, Irish culture in particular, and the musings of a naturally funny and gifted storyteller. I enjoyed every page and laughed out loud many times. His comic timing is very good. I have spent many vacations in Ireland and I really think he captured the culture in an original, masterful and insightful way. The tales of drunkenness were like flies annoying me while reading, but they hardly affect the ultimate fun of this unique offering to literature
