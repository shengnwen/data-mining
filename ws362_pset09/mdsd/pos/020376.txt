This story is touching,and this is how I wish to express character's feelings to my readers.     Notice the stairway in the end, and the way the foil of this story shields Mrs. Mallards vision from seeing her unwanted  husband who, against Mrs. Mallard's wishes,still lives. I can't tell you  the rest, but reading this story is good for you people who like shocking  climaxes
