After all the hullabaloos in the NY Times over authors writing their own reviews, because of the comments of Rechy, I picked up this book over the weekend and couldn't put it down.  Curiosity got the best of me.  The book is hilarious.  I enjoyed every minute. I recall reading Rechy's excellent but dark CITY OF NIGHT.  This is such a contrast.  It is humorous yet touching, proving Rechy's strong virtuosity as a topflight novelist.  It is story telling at its best - a bewitching wickedly entertaining tome in which an irrepressible young hero is set loose in the "born again" world of Texas, the clubs of Las Vegas, and then on to the seductive allure of crazed filled Los Angeles.  Finely written, a very good read, highly recommended and I'm pleased to rediscover this excellent writer
