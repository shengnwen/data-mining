Yes, it is a great book! I finish in one afternoon. I couldn't down the book once I started reading.... Mr. Hall provides a very rich history of the Chinatown in New York City during the mid-1800s period. He is succeeded to &quot;enable the reader to smell history.&quot; In the book, Mr. Hall describes his father &quot;denied&quot; his identity of Chinese which shows the typical dilemma of the new generation of Chinese immigrants in the United States. However, I was &quot;confused&quot; by the subtitle, &quot;a family memoir of chinatwon&quot;. I expect that the book mainly describes the author's family history, rather than concerns on the hisotry of Chinatown history
