Every once in a while I get a book I can't put down, and this was definitely one!  The story line is great and moves quickly, and I loved all the characters.  They all felt real.  And the autopsy was REALLY real, to the point where I'm pretty sure I'd never want to attend one!  Ferguson obviously did a lot of research.  I don't want to give anything away but will say that it's a nail-biter
