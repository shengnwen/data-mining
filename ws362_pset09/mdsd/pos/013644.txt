I got this book last year.  It is simple and easy to read. I ordered the supplements immediately.  In 3 months I had lowered my cholesterol 28 points so the Dr. did not make me try a prescription.  Even with a foot injury and not exercising, the eating habits and taking the phytosterols this year, my cholesterol was down even more.  I highly recommend it!
