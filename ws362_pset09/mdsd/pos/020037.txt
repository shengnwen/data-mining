Marta shares many interesting stories in this followup to Learning Their Language. Understanding your pet is so important, and the more we can learn about and develop positive interactive communication signals the stronger will be the bond we share with our furry family members. Being "in-touch" with
your pet is an important part of enhancing the human-animal bond, and a critical part of a successful holistic health care program. Those clients whose patients I am proud to treat who are most in-tune with their pets have the greatest successes with both preventing and treating diseases.
