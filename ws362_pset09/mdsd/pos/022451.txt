I enjoyed this installment of the series much better than the last few, mainly because Lee's involvement didn't seem that contrived. I just wish she had based her involvement more on her mother's history than on "curiousity."

The tongue tangling gimmick, however, has got to go. It's getting to the point where it's annoying and takes away from the story. With all the times it occurred, and then Lee called more attention to it by saying "I mean..." and restating what she'd been trying to say in its entirety, coupled with the other person's reaction, it started to seem like the author was cashing in on the gimmick just to fill a word count
