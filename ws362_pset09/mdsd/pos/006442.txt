Work with Passion is the single most important book I've ever read in terms of producing tangible improvements in my everyday life. I was suffering from a terminal case of career angst with no cure in sight when I stumbled upon this rare jewel of an author. Following Nancy's tried and true approach gave me the structure (and hope!) I needed to find work I'm passionate about. Working with the author one-on-one as a client also accelerated my learning curve tremendously. Nancy is as warm, funny, wise, and practical in person as she is in print. I recommend this book to anyone in search of a strategy for ushering happiness into all aspects of their lives
