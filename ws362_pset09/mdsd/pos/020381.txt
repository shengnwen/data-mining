This book is a great edition to the Last of the Jedi series! I liked this one because we get to go to Naboo and see how the people there have adjusted to the Empire. Once again, this book had an ending that leaves you wondering what happens to Ferus, Trever and everyone else. I hope the next book answers some of the questions left by Death on Naboo
