I recommend this author to my criminal justice classes not just because it is true crime, but because the writer is an investigator and does what I encourage my students to do: 1. get it in writing 2. get the facts 3. back up your facts with documentation 4. make it interesting and informative. I believe the WM3 deserve new trials. I believe there is much more to this story we may never know or get to the bottom of, and I know the characters involved are a tapestry of good, bad, and ugly. This is real life at its best! Both of the author's books are about real people and how a "small" crime suddenly hurls them into international "fame" and spotlight. How training can effect a police department (lack of training, in this case). And the ripple effect of crime and it's horror. If you enjoy true crime - not the blood n guts but intellectual reading - and investigation, turn off "CSI" (which is cr*p) and open any of Mara's books
