Diane Stein's Essential Reiki is a perfect manual for any Reiki Master/Teacher - it teaches a complete system of Reiki - as She Teaches it. 

However, this is not a manual i would suggest as an introduction to Reiki. Something more like William Rand's Reiki Manual would be better for beginners, and then after Reiki 2 or Reiki 3 is learned, then this manual comes into play. 

It's a wonderful manual that makes the Reiki-Reader think... and that's a very good thing!!!

I highly suggest this manual to Every Reiki Master/Teacher and to any Reiki Level 2 or Higher that is wanting to go further in their practice
