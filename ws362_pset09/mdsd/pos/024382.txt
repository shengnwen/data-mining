Mother is ill and Dick and Jane, with their own families and new friends, help her recover and receive a visit from little sister Sally -- the only one in the family who lives in the "real" world -- she teaches a course in Transgressive Feminist Ceramics at Berkeley!  In roughly the format of the old Dick and Jane books, we learn a lot about the families' friends and neighbors, all told with a smattering of Yiddish phrases, which are defined in a Glossary.

Funny and well done, with story lines for adults
