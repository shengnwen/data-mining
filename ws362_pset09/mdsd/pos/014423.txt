This is a much updated version of his already excellent first edition.

In this edition he shows even less restrain in going against the ADA "Party Line".  Maybe because since the first edition there are now several studies clearly showing the benefits of a low carbohydrate diet for everybody, especially diabetics. The good doctor names names, always telling why he is doing so.

In this edition he doesn't praise the "glycemic index" anymore, the only not so good recommendation in his first book.

My father was diagnosed diabetic six years ago. I gave him a copy of the previous edition of this book and a glucose meter. His life changed. He not only has excellent health with little medication, he also learned to so some "controlled extravagancies" and can eat and drink at parties and events. The he loaned the book to a friend of my brother that reversed his diabetes, sex life included. He even founded a self-help group in his hometown.

If you are diabetic, has a loved one who is or if you have "metabolic syndrome", that is, is a diabetic in the making, STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING, GET AND READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW
