This is an excellent book.  It is written by a professional writer who is experienced in presenting technical information for the not so technical person.  By this, I mean you do not have to have a advanced computer technology degree to understand this book. Also, if you have been around any previous version of Windows and perhaps did some repairing or tinkering of the your operating system, then this book is written for you.
If, on the other hand, you only want to "operate the car" and not "look under the hood", then this is probably more than you need.  If you do not enjoy tweaking Windows operating systems, then you may be better served by a good basic book on Windows XP, such as "Windows XP for Dummies".
