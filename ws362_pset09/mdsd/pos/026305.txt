Bill Buford does a nice job, especially the first 3rd of the book which focuses on Mario Batali and Babbo.  The middle essay does tend to drag a bit, with the Italian Cooking History, but the latter part is strong.  I didn't feel the book spent enough time on themes that the average US reader of Michael Ruhlman or Tony Bourdain would be interested in.  The book tends to focus a bit too much on why Bill Buford wanted to do some of this stuff.  The search for the earliest recipe for pasta with a particular sauce really lost me.  Overall, solid, but not spectacular
