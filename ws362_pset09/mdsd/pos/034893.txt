 The art book to which this product is related, is really quite fantastic. A simple, accessible and dymystifying look at the art world and artistic styles and movements which gives glorious little representations of the works on offer and wise words which avoid art world snobbery.
 This is a box of post cards based on the book which allows the images you loved in the book to be portable, artisticly usable and sharable. Use as for notelets, celebrations or to brighten up a dull room,Delightful
