I enjoyed the picture book Dear Mr. Blueberry greatly. It describes well how a little girl feels when someone tells her that what she says she saw cannot be real. It is a pretty sad book that is made up of letters a little girl, Emily, writes to her teacher, Mr. Blueberry, about a whale she finds in her pond. I will not tell you the conclusion because it is only good when you read the book. I reccomend this book to people of all ages. Even though it is a kids' book you can get something out of it every time you read it
