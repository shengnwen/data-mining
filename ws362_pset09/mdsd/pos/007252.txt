I'm a huge fan of the Isabel Dalhousie novels, especially because I just couldn't get into the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. Isabel is just hilarious and her latest antics are no different. I especially liked how this novel dealt more with Isabel than the situations around her. The ending was quite a surprise and not at all what I expected McCall Smith to do, but I've come to accept it. It can not stand on its own, but out of the other two novels, it's the best by far. I can't wait for the next installment
