This book offers persuasive arguments for increasing mathematical literacy, as if we needed much convincing. His case is presented by way of a varied set of examples that drive the point home... eventually. This is because it often feels as if the author is showing off how clever he can be, and the text tends to wander off a bit too self-referentially into the esoterics of the example at hand.

For a more focused version of his ideas, I urge you to read another one of his books: "A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper"
