Speaking across a generational divide, I find "Writing Dialogue"
helpful for self-editing. I am too annoyed by the tv culture to sustain interest in author's clever essays. But I do look at tv in spurts with better informed, purposive ear.  It is bending the ear to picture scenes that instructs my writing.
Helpful, but annoying in my sixties.
