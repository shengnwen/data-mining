Unlike many romance books written over a hundred years ago, Jane Eyre doesn't move slowly in the least. It has a great main character, a series of wonderful side-characters, and a interesting romance that is not quite what is expected.

Jane is an orphan from early childhood. After the deaths of her parents, she went to live with her aunt and uncle. After her uncle's death, Jane's aunt was not happy with having her in the house, and at age 10, Jane was sent to boarding school. There she grew up and matured, making friends, studying, learning, and eventually becoming a teacher. After two years of teaching at her school, she left and went out to be a young girl's private tutor.

Now, understand that I have not just summed up the first twenty pages for you, but rather the first one or two hundred. Everything in there goes into much more detail, but it's never boring, and it never stops dead. Jane is a lively, exciting character, and this is all part of her story. What I'm about to get to is not where the story starts, but rather the middle, where things begin to change.

Jane is employed in Mr. Rochester's house to tutor his charge, Adele. Yes, this is rather predictable, but it IS a romance book, and you can't expect them to be surprising. Jane finds Mr. Rochester an interesting man, and Mr. Rochester finds Jane quite intruiging. But, as usual, there are difficulties, drama, etc. However, in this book, this all is written very well, and works out fine, that it's okay.

So. I'm  not going to spoil the rest of the book for you, because I think you should read it yourself! Even if you're not too fond of romances, this book is very good, and even if you don't like classics, this book deserves to be read by everyone. It's an excellent book, and I suggest you at least TRY to read it. It's worth it. So... stop reading reviews, and go to a library or buy the book!
