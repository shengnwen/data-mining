I found this book totally inspiring!  If you've never made jewelry before, this is a perfect starting point!  Using 3 simple pliers, a spool of wire and some beads ... you can get started.  Beautifully photographed with step-by-step images (just like a good recipe book), the pages walk you through each stage of fabrication.  It is packed with design ideas that would inspire anyone interested in using wire and beads.  A perfect gift for a craft maker!
