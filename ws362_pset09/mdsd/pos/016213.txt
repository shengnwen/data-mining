Not intended as a scholarly or unbiased book, this collection of movie lists range from the hilariously perceptive - "13 great perks of being a movie character" to the wholly opinionated - "The 40 worst movies I've ever seen." The title caught my eye and the humorous writing kept me reading. Some of the lists are, well just lists like "Sequels that have equaled or bettered the original." No explanation or justification - just a list. And some of the lists are just self indulgent - "Attack of the quote whores" which collects those random fluff love quotes that we see in advertisement and puts them on a couple of pages for no good reason at all. Still, Roeper has taken some of that love of movies that propelled him to where he is by showing "5 Reasons George Baily Isn't Such a Wonderful Guy in It's a Wonderful Life," and the mentioned below "7 movies in which Ben Affleck cries like a big fat baby." If you are looking for serious cinematic writing, go look for Pauline Kael. Otherwise this is a great little commute, waste time or bathroom book. I only wish Roeper had put in a table of contents so I could easily find the gems again when I look for them instead of flipping through the book. Just silly. Enjoy
