Followers of Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh have always felt close to this kind and gentle teacher.  In this compilation of Buddhist chants and ceremonies used at his community of Plum Village, we are given a chance to participate in the meritous work of Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh and, of course, the Buddha.  Whether or not we are able to visit Plum Village in person, I feel this book will provide a crucial and nurturing link to that holy place. More detailed instructions for the ceremonies would be a nice, but the book is structured along the lines of a traditional book of common prayer, so it is not necessarily within its scope to provide lengthy instruction.  A note about form: the language is mostly traditional, which might strike some western Buddhists as narrow.  Hopefully, those familiar Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh's teaches will understand that he never advocates a strictly traditional, rigid understanding of ancient Buddhist concepts.  All in all, this is a very useful and beautiful volume written and compiled by a loving community
