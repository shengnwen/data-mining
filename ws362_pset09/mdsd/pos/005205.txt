Dr. Pickover has written an entertaining account of time travel.  The book may be enjoyed by a scientist or an ordinary reader.  In keeping with his unique thought process Pickover has appended a section of comments provided  by friends, in effect a set of book reviews.  One comment - &quot;The  relativistic metric is hyperbolic&quot; can only be appreciated by a  physicist.  Pickover is indeed a world-class science writer.  Any of his  books is worth reading.  It is a surprise that he did not make himself a  subject of his book titled &quot;Strange Brains and Genius; The Secret  Lives of Eccentric Scientists and Madmen&quot;
