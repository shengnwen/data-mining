I have just finished this book.  It was a delight.  Uncle Remus is one of the most alive characters ever to be portrayed in literature.  Now, this is coming from someone who has read Conrad, Doctorow, Carrol, D.H. Lawrence, Robertson Davies, and many other engaging storytellers.  Somehow, Uncle Remus resonated with me across the 120+ years since it was written.  The simple concept of a free slave mentoring a plantation owner's boy by masterful storytelling is pure magic and often heart-warming.  For anyone young at heart, this book is a must.
