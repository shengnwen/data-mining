As someone who has tried to keep up with the happenings of the Emerging Church and its growing library over the last several years, I found Gibbs and Bolger's book to be a needed addition to the burgeoning bibliography of Emergent reading.

The strength in the book lies when Gibbs and Bolger attempt to show what the Emergent Church does as opposed to what its doctrines are.  There are plenty of books each trying to claim a doctrinal place for Emergent, but few that show us what an Emergent church actually looks like.  Gibbs and Bolger do this very well.

Some reviews below this one give good overviews of the book.  There are only two flaws which kept the book from five stars in my book.  First, I feel that Gibbs and Bolger are a little too quick to wrap the Emergent church into the evangelical wings of Christianity.  This may be the church's eventual place, but for now, I feel it is a little too early for any group to lay claim to what Emergent is doing.  Secondly, and this is really a critique of ALL Emergent church books, everybody in the book is just too white and male.  While they do a great job of balancing views from Europe and America, there is still a lack of voices from women or from those who aren't out of the Caucasian evangelical communities of the past fifty years.

However, on the whole, this book does a great job of what not many other Emergent church books are doing...finding a framework for definitions of what Emergent is instead of what people want it to be.
