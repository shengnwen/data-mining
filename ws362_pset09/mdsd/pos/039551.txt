Not your typical film encyclopedia.  Instead of general-information blurbs, Thomson offers a critical assesment of the actors, directors, producers and other filmic figures he references.  The best entries attempt to come to terms with their subject's meaning, his or her importance to the development of cinema as an international and a local/national artform -- and this describes virtually every entry in the book.  Be aware, Thomson has very definite opinions and no fear of sharing them, but don't let that turn you off.  Even if you disagree with his appraisals, his criticism is founded on sound reasoning, and presented in dense, articulate prose.  The book does have its faults, of course; Thomson offers only a cursory treatment of contemporary cinema -- he has substantive comments for Tom Cruise and Speilberg, but other contemporary figures receive little more than a filmography.  Still, this book should be useful to anyone interested in film history and criticism, or arts criticism in general
