If I were stuck on a desert island and could only bring one author with me, I would definitely bring something by Joyce Carol Oates.  I've probably read about 15 of her books over the last several decades and she never fails to deliver.

Sexy is part of her young adult series.  It is every bit as good as Big Mouth and Ugly Girl, although frankly, I felt that the endings in both cases left something to be desired.  Perhaps Oates believes that adolescents need more cheer than adults and has skewed her endings to be slightly more positive for the teens.

At any rate, Sexy is about Darren, a 16-year-old pretty boy who is coming to terms with his sexual identity.  It discusses ethical issues like loyalty and betrayal and how hard it is for Darren to take the high road and do the right and decent thing when he's placed in a moral dilemma.

As always, Joyce Carol Oates writes a character driven novel with incredibly well developed and believable main characters.
She also strives to address certain social issues -- for example, homosexuality and false accusations in this book and hysteria regarding school shootings or bomb threats in Big Mouth and Ugly Girl -- and never sounds preachy while doing so.

Highly recommended.
