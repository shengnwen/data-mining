I received a copy of Beth Teitell's book as a gift. I'm so pleased that I did, it reminds me so much of how I was feeling during my first pregnancy as well as the early years of my child's life. Beth hits the nail on the head. She is witty and truthful, all while writing in a style that makes us `regular moms' feel so much better about some of the crazy thoughts I'm sure we've all had! I plan on giving this book as a gift to all of my friends who are moms-to-be and I look forward to reading her in the future!
