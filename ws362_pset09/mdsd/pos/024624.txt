Stephen King's first book is well written, and he paints an image of high school that most will identify with (peer pressure, bullying, interaction between very different social and economic classes).  The plot centers around a young girl Carrie, and her struggle to fit into high school due to her extremely religious mother.  Due to the movie's iconic images, I'm sure most people will know what's going to happen before even picking up the book.  Still, it is an entertaining and worthwhile read.

My one complaint is that King writes in a journalistic fashion (including interviews, pages from other "made-up" books) to build the whole story about what happens to Carrie.  The style (which King borrows from Bram Stoker's Dracula according to his introduction for Carrie) detached me from the story--it focused on POVs from side characters that weren't interesting.  It also lessened the impact of some of the novel's suprises and twists.  However, the book is worth checking out and much shorter than King's later and sometimes overbloated novels
