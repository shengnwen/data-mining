I read this book from front to back and found it a very good read. No doubt I will get even more out of it when I look at it again. The authors propose a holistic approach to the creation, development and nuture of high  performance teams through participatory management. I was so impressed by  their argument I have commended the book to my colleagues as a model we  might follow in our soon to be started business
