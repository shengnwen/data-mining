						
 	In this book, a pig got adopted by a dog named fly on a sheep farm in Gloucestershire, England.  Then one day she named him Babe and it stuck.  Then fly had to do something with the boss.  Then they came back with a sheep.  Then Babe asked what is that mum?  There is the stupidest animal on earth, sheep.  Then Babe wanted to meet the sheep.  
	So he did then he asked what her name was. She said it was Ma.  Then Babe wanted to meet the flock.  So they made a plan. It was to let Mr. Hogget and Fly go to the market.   Have Ma go back in to the flock.  One day, Babe went up the hill and saw the sheep running like crazy.   He felt anger against the dogs.  He ran after them; then he rammed one in the side.  One day, Mr. Hoggett went to the trials with Babe in the back of the truck.  Will Babe win the trials?  I think this book is for any age.  I recommend this book to read for fun.
