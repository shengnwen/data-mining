If physiology bores you, specifically, explanations about how the different parts of the brain work and send signals to the body, then it may be a difficult to read this book. But if you get through it (or skim over it), you'll get a comprehensive explanation of why people act the way they do -- at home, at work, and in school -- in response to the physiological systems that were designed for an earlier time in the history of humankind. Shows how decisions and plans are not made based solely on logical consequences, but often based on people's past, vague memories, and strong feelings. 

Practical applications: understand the indvidual human basis of office politics, the challenges of managing and leading a team. And of course, learn more about to live in a family. Also talks about educational solutions to train children and adults to interact better and more peacefully
