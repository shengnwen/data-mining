Rarely has an auhor hit her 'mark' 9 times out of 10 (so to speak), but Ann Rule is definitely this kind of writer.
No Regrets has proved to be next to impossible to put down!  I may be a bit prejudiced as Ms Rule is my hands down favorite author, but this volume held my interest from page 1!!
Whether you be an avid reader or an 'airline reader' do yourself a huge favor and make this your next read. 
Thank you, Ann, I can't wait for your next book!
