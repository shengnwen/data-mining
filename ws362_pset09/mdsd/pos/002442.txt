I am a little surprised by the negative reviews of this book--perhaps some reviewers don't personally know any firefighters--and that is the point of this book: an inside look at how one firefighter(albeit a chief) experienced and survived the attack and collapse of the World Trade Center. 

As a BC, Picciotto, had a company of men under his command who were looking to him for direction and literally commands. Firefighting is a military-style profession where you take orders and do what you're told by superiors. Firefighters are full of "bravado" at what ever level--it comes with the territory. Work hard, play hard, brag hard...that's real stuff.

The best part about this book is the "voice" of Picciotto coming through the writing. His description of the sound of the collapsing tower mixed with his feelings of the certainty of death were very well written. His last thoughts were on his family--that is a part of the job most don't want to talk about. You gain a sense of the confusion, the disbelief, and the frustrations present that day in NYC on 9/11. You are inside his head and thoughts the entire time--it is an excellent book to gain a different/purposefully personal perspective on what that day was like. It is clear this book is about one man's experience, not an entire city or department's experience. I am certain that all New Yorkers and firefighters have their own stories of bravery and despair and hope. Talk to one...they are extraordinary people.
