I have to say that what Jerry Willard did in publishing his edition of J.S. Bach's Complete Works was to not inflict upon the music his musical conception, through over-fingering or ornamentation. It is perfect for the professional guitarist who wants a very reliable transcription in the accepted "guitar keys", as well as a great study version for any student of the guitar. Like his other publication of the Bach Inventions for the guitar by the same publisher, it is a diet staple both for me and my students.

It is generally accepted that one must study these suites with a great teacher who has familiarity with the style, (which Jerry Willard is!)and to read alot about performance practice to determine for yourself what the best choices are. All this is possible if you own this edition. In the end, Willard leaves the choices to us. 

Excellent book!
