Chinese Takeout is a very readable and entertaining novel of a struggling artist named Orloff Trenchant, known as Or. Or is among the many downtown New York City artists trying to climb out of poverty and obscurity. As the novel begins, Or is quickly plummeting to new depths in his fledgling career. His girlfriend dumps him for a wealthy art collector,  probably the worst insult possible to a bohemian artist. Meanwhile he is living in a broken down van and his only regular income is  selling used books on the streets. Chinese Takeout is not big on plot; it is a meandering but observant look at life on the streets in this rather fascinating subculture. All of the action takes place over a couple of months during the end of 2000; the controversial presidential election of that year is in the background for much of the novel. Arthur Nersesian, who has written a couple of other books with a similar theme, creates several interesting characters in addition to Or, including Rita, the heroin addict with whom Or becomes infatuated and Shade, the older artist who lets Or sublet his loft. The book effectively evokes the worldview of the artist, who sees life in vivid, emotionally-charged and uncompromising terms. On the other hand Or and some of the other artists can also be arrogant and self-absorbed in their self-conscious quest for authenticity. The main challenges Or faces during the time we spend with him are to sculpt a headstone in a few short weeks (no easy matter) and the roller coaster ride of being in love with a self-destructive addict. Chinese Takeout is a fast read, always interesting and sometimes thought-provoking. I wouldn't call it an especially deep or memorable book, but while I was reading it I had trouble putting it down
