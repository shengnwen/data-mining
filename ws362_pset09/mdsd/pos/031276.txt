This book is a marvel of reporting. A tightly written exposure of eth Yawkey traditions and how the cronyism of the Sox ownership was teh real "curse" of the Sox. Sheds a whole new light on many Sox ball players such as Teddy, Joe Cronin, Pumpsie Green, Reggie Smith, Jim Rice, Yaz, Fisk, Ellis Burks, and Mo Vaughn. Bryant does a great job of weaving teh Red Sox pight witrh that of the Boston news media (Globe was a rag apparently not all too long ago) and teh city itself. As a new resident to the Boston area, I can still see the deep racial segregation that Bryant speaks of today. The odd thing as that the "economics of winning", meaning you pay for teh top player regardless of race, may be the end of racism in baseball. Capitalism trumps racism. Whooda thunk
