NOT MUCH TO ADD TO THE GREAT REVIEWS I HAVE READ HERE SINCE READING THIS BOOK MYSELF . IF YOU ARE INTRIGUED OR JUST INTERESTED IN MAN AGAINS THE ELEMENTS ( and losing ) THIS IS ONE MORE TO ADD TO YOUR READING MUSTS .
ERIK LARSON DID A SPLENDID JOB IN COMBINING NOT JUST THE STORM OF 1900 BUT, MAKING NOTE OF OTHER STORMS AND EVENTS AROUND THAT TIME.  ALSO HIS ABILITY TO MAKE YOU HAVE THE SENSATION OF ALSO FEELING WHAT SOME OF THE LUCKY SURVIVORS MUST HAVE BEEN GOING THRU AND HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT .
MR. LARSON HAS DONE HIS HOMEWORK. RARE WHEN I SAY " OUTSTANDING JOB " , ABOUT ANY WRITTEN WORK ON HERE . BUT..." OUTSTANDING JOB , MR. LARSON " , SIMPLY OUTSTANDING.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU LIKE THE MORE GROSS SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE, I SUGGEST YOU PICK UP MR. LARSON'S " DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY " . RECOUNTS A SERIAL KILLER OF THE MOST GRUESOME  KIND DURING THE  " CHICAGO'S " 1893  WORLD'S FAIR .
