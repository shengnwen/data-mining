This is the rerelease of a book written in the early-to-mid 80's. It's still a great read. Bonanno brings the strengths of book-writing to a film property - flash backs, out-of-sequence story-telling and a wider landscape, and makes it all work.

Since it was written pre-almost-everything-else, there are a few anachronisms that must be forgiven, but I didn't find them distracting.  The characters are spot on, the dillemma interesting, and the pace brisk.  I remember reading this when it was first written and really enjoying knowing what was going on after the TV show and before the second movie. This time it takes a bit to re-orient where everything takes place (has this happened yet? No? Okay...)
The new characters are likable and instantly accessible.  Of all the 40th Anniversary books, this is the one to read
