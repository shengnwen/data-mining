This is one of the funniest calendars I've come across in a long time. Everyone in the office comes to see what cat shenanigan's are shared for that day. We actually pass the sheets around to share when I tear it off at the end of the day. I saw this calendar while visiting out-of-town. I had just gotten a flat tire, was stranded in a strange town, managed to get to the Automotive Center. Had a good three hour wait. Walked to the mall nearby. Saw this calendar. Amused myself while sitting in a smelly, stifling garage, leafing through these pages. Started to laugh out loud. Ended up sharing it with everyone in the garage and waiting room and laughing so hard we all had tears in our eyes! Sure, the pictures were submitted by the owners and aren't award-winning caliber, but they are more natural and catch the felines in their native habitat at their most natural self. I love it! I'm hooked and will be hoping to get another calendar next year! I LOVE the little snippets at the bottom--laugh out loud stuff!! Like the other reviewer says, I'm not a college student or anything--far from it--middle-aged mom who loves cats and have shared my life with them since I was 2 years old--and I think this calendar is just a classic--darn funny! Some of the people in the office aren't even fans of cats and join us in our laughter--the pictures and captions are so dead on! Hobby: Meowing in rhyme! I mean--imagine it! And the additional joy is that often I find myself saying, yes, my cat has done the exact same thing.... So what if it's not in color! Big deal! Get over it already! The photos and snippets can turn any bad day into a much better (happier) one, and isn't that one of the reasons why we keep calendars on our desk at work to look at a hundred times a day
