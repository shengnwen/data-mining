This no-nonsense book is a must have for anyone connected with marketing and makes an excellent reference guide on marketing metrics. 

I found it useful while planning for metrics in a specific business situation. If I were to make a suggestion, a little casebook that illustrates how multiple metrics work in tandem would make a great companion to this book
