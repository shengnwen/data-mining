Definitely a very good overview of the SCOR model (Supply Chain Chain Operations Reference).  I have used this book as a base reference for Kaizen processes I have championed, with SCOR as a structural foundation.  

My only reservation is that the book reviews how the overall process works from a project perspective without digging into the metrics.  An experienced practitioner can get around this through experience and other resources however it would have been nice to have.  To offset this the auther goes into the "whys" and the "whats" instead of the "hows" and does an extremely good job at his targeted subject material.

I would most definitely purchase and use this book again, and recommend it to others looking to use SCOR processes to improve their balanced scorecards.
