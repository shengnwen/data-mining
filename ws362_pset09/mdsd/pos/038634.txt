This book has been one of my daughter's favorites for a year.  We first got it from the library when she was 6. She loved it so much she wanted her own copy and got one for her birthday. Now she reads it to me!  My daughter loves the smart, polite, yet mischievous Matilda.  She laughs out loud at the funny passages in the story.

Be prepared; this is a typical Roald Dahl book, and the humor is a little quirky.  Matilda is the exceptionally gifted daughter of parents who think she is a "twit" and a "scab."  They either ignore her or verbally abuse her.  Matilda gets back at them by playing tricks to "punish" them.  My daughter says that I should warn you that your child might learn some tricks from this book.  These punishments are things that you would not want your child trying at home!  

Matilda finds a heroine in her teacher at school, though Matilda becomes a heroine to her teacher, rescuing her from her own problems.  We won't give away any more of the story, but good triumphs over evil in the end
