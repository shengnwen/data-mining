The plot is scandalous and there is no question about that but what really moved me beyond the lives of the two main characters (Barbara and Sheba) was the gentle reminder about how mental illness can become a real disaster if gone untreated. I agree with another reader that this book makes an excellent read for a book club. There are so many social issues that Barbara as unbalanced as she appears to be brings up and they all make great topics for some heated discussions. I guess it goes to show we all bleed the same regardless of our differences.

There are probably so many women out there who could relate to both Barbara and Sheba and reading this book may push them to look at their lives from a different frame of mind.
