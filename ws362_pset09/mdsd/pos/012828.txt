I thought this was an excellent book and it certainly describes how to achieve power but only to a limited extent.  In the final analysis you must ACTUALLY know what you are doing and you must have the support of others.  Every star sets just as it rises and anyone who thinks that they will never suffer reverses or need the support of others lives in the dream world described in this book.  All of these techniques are real and based on my experience and observation they work, but what is missing from this book is any word of caution.  At least Machiavellie gives you some of the downsides, which this book lacks. This is the "law of the west" and just like the old west, there is ALWAYS a faster gun and the person who has practiced these techniques will find himself in real trouble when he meets that faster gun.  With over 30 years in the corporate world I know first hand that ruthless people get ruthless treatment and in the end all you have is your reputation and the support of those who believe in you.  If you use these techniques without regard for others or your reputation in the end it will cost you.  However, these techniques are real and they do work, but I think they should be applied sparingly
