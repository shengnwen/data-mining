Whether stock or bond prices are rising or falling there is always some pundit who will be more than happy to attribute it to some canned response like disappointing earnings or political uncertainty.  But what these pundits rarely own up to when they make their observations is that they are guessing and usually don't know any more about the real reasons than the rest of us at home.  Or, even worse, many pundits will hype a financial offering because they stand to make money if they can stir interest. Not so with Ron Insana or his masterful book.  Ron's book does dole out great information and a behind-the-scenes look at what's really going on in the markets from someone who isn't working for a financial services firm.  The editors at Amazon made a good call when they named this book one of the 10 best of the year.  I also liked one of their other choices: &quot;Simple Money Solutions&quot; by Nancy Lloyd.  After seeing Ron interview Nancy on CNBC I bought her book and it is the best Personal Finance book I have ever seen.  These two books should be rquired reading for anyone who hopes to achieve financial security
