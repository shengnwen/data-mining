I found Philip Smith's book to be a factual, detailed, and data-driven account of a promising company (and town) wrecked by unadulterated personal greed.  While I have never met Mr. Smith, I do know several of the principles named in the book and Mr. Smith describes them accurately and honestly.

The book is a fascinating look at the behind-the-scenes behaviors of senior management.  Unfortunately, it is not all that clear what lessons can be taken away from the event.  Honesty and fair-dealing cannot be injected into scoundrels like a vaccine.  And when a majority of board members decide to loot the corporation for their own gain, what can realistically be done?

I do know that the aftermath has been devastating to Weirton, and its future is very uncertain.  And after living there during the glory days, it is very strange to come back and see the devastation that has become my little town
