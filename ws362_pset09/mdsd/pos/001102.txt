First, I want to say that the ONLY books that I buy are written by Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb!  I am so addicted to her books that I have a really hard time putting them down once I start reading.  I just finished reading Valley of Silence.  WOW!  I loved it!  I started with the very first one in the trilagy and flew through it.  I couldn't wait until the second came out.  Then time seemed to drag until I could get my hands on the last one so that I could find out what happened!  I loved the story.  I am not really into vampires and witches and things like that, but the way that Nora tells a story is so captivating and I will read anything that she writes.  I have never been able to find an author that has such a wonderful way of telling a story that keeps me interested.  I am always on the look out for a new book.  I can't wait to get my hands on Angel's Fall.  The excerpt at the end of Valley of Silence had me wanting to know what was going to happen next.  Why was Reece the way that she was.  WOW!  Great job holding my interest once again.  Ready for the next IN DEATH so that I can get my dose of Eve and Roarke
