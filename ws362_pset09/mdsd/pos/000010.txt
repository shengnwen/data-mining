Shy, awkward Mary Anne lacks self-confidence, doesn't have a mother, and is too timid to talk to kids she doesn't know, especially boys.  Her thirteenth birthday party ends in disaster when poor Mary Anne is too  frightened by all the attention focused on her and runs out on her own  party.  And to top it all off, she's got a crush on one of the cutest,  self-confident guys in eighth grade, Logan Bruno.  She senses Logan likes  her back, but she stutters and blushes when she tries to talk to him.  It  was kind of sweet how Logan liked her for who she was rather than zeroing  in on some pretty, bubbly girl.  Mary Anne might not be a great beauty or  have social graces, but she's sensitive, interesting, kind, and one of the  smartest kids in Stoneybrook!  I like how her friends understand her  nervousness and don't ridicule her or pressure her to be more outgoing.  Mary Anne's going through a tough struggle, but I have a feeling that with  her friends' support, she'll make it in this world
