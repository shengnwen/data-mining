Not recommended for non-golfers, but a great read for anyone who thinks they've got a game. After reading it, I have a newfound appreciation for the guys in the final pairings on Sunday. Most memorable line of the book: "The PGA tagline 'These Guys are Good' should be appended to read 'These Guys are Good. How Good? You Have No F'ing Idea.'"
