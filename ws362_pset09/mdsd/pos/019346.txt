After the incident with the Ontailians, the Enterprise is sent to a far away part of the galaxy to determine what happened to a race that was presumed destroyed centuries before. Not to my surprise, they found a civilization that survived after all that time. There's some good character moments, but one of the reasons I don't give this five stars is because it's hard to keep up with the dialogue. Two lines of dialogue are written and then you get two pages of what the characters are thinking about, and then you get a few more lines and have to flip back to see where the conversation had left off before the lengthy explinations.The book also explains everything in detail over and over again, but at least that way you never forget what's going on because if you set the book down for a week and go back to it, the whole situation will be mentioned again - in detail. It's much better than A Time to Die, specially since there's no Wesley in this book
