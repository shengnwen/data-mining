I think this book is good enough but one needs more updated strategies to make in this game 

These days it's really hard to find trading books that are practical and simple to understand. Most of the info outhere is full of the same thecnical analysis jargon that makes you lose a lot of times. Basically most tehcnical trading books tell you the same story but organized in different chapters using different words and charts as examples. 

Some places on the web have pretty practical information. One site that I recommend is StressFreeTraders com. They have a pretty clear way for trading stocks with momentum using easy to understand strategies. This is also one place where you can understand why the use of a Level 2 system is critical for trading the rally. 

Understanding how to trade a rally is one of the most important aspects of trading, since for us traders the rally is where we make our money.
