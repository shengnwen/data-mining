What a fascinating book. Perhaps autistic people have it more often than not right.  They deserve more credit.

Furthermore, what a great detective.  I didn't quite feel the unraveling of the mystery in this book coming as it did.

Christopher, the main character in this book, would say: 
This book is great for anyone:  
- who likes to get a better understanding of other people, especially autistic ones;
- who likes a good old fashioned detective book
