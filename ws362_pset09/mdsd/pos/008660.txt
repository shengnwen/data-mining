This book is in the classic style of English comedy. My favorite jokes were the subtle ones, such as how each chapter title sounds like a thrilling pirate adventure, ending with an exclamation mark ("Battling the Giant Squid!") when nothing of that sort happens in that chapter at all. I also found it hilarious how some of the details were minutely researched, such as the atomic weights of various minerals in the climactic pirate battle, while other details were so blatantly stereotyped, such as all the scientists wearing white lab coats, without even a hint of questioning. If you find that kind of thing funny, this is your book.

I give it only 4 stars because some of the running jokes were a bit forced (such as making a bouncy castle out of jellyfish) and pointless (pirates love ham?
