A Darkness at Sethanon is the conclusion of the Riftwar Saga and truly brings this saga to a magnificent close. Jimmy the Hand, Pug, Mystery Character ( dont' want to spoil ), and Tomas truly richen the experience as Feist's character building really grows.

In Silverthorn they found that a dark power was hidden behind the enemy forces they have been having problems with - and this dark power is a mystery that Pug decided he must go back through the Rift to deduce a plan of destroying the evil.

Pug has truly become strong in his powers and Tomas is finally understanding the depths of his powers as a 'reborn' dragonlord. 

The battles are not comparable to the time spent with Pug and Tomas ( I truly enjoyed the chemistry that these characters have and thier desires for good to succeed. ) 

Jimmy the hand, the thief from the mockers steals the time that Feist keeps us away from Pug and Tomas and I cannot wait for them to get together on something ( maybe?? ) 

I say if you have read the beginning you have no choice but to pick this up, but if you have not started this series and feel a bit 'iffy' do yourself a favor and pick it up!
