I purchased the Leader's Guide for The Jesus I Never Knew so that we would have an additional teacher's guide.  At my church, two of us are team-teaching this class.  I strongly suggest that anyone planning on using this guide to lead a class centered around the Yancy book use the kit which includes the video.  The kit includes this guide.

The guide lends itself well to planning a discussion oriented study of the Yancey book.
