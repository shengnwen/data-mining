Although I could empathized with the circumstances surrounding heroine (Duchess / Josephina) being emotionally withdrawn in the beginning, as a child, however as a woman her stoic - self taught freeing herself from passion, unmoved by joy or grief, and submit without complaint to unavoidable necessity - was maddening for the hero (Marcus). Although Marcus was full of resentment and exceedingly verbally abusive throughout most of the book, however, in the end he took as much as he gave once Duchess' character developed some backbone and became feisty. My goodness, that practical joke he played on the Duchess with his hypothetical mistress coming to visit with them had me laughing out loud - that is, once I finished reading the scene. At first I wanted to clobber him too, but afterwards when I found out the truth I could not stop laughing at the new, lively, spirited Duchess.

The sub characters, especially Aunt Wilhelmina, had me busting out the seams every time she open her mouth and covered up her supposed "Tourettes Syndrome" with shrewd rhyming responses. Duchess AND Marcus made a good tag team against her imaginary syndrome in the end. 

Once Marcus came to accept his "doom" to be Earl of Chase through marriage to Duchess; his character developed into a very caring and considerate lover, generous friend and playful husband.

I felt the same as the sharp-witted maid, Miss Maggie, did...the villain deserved more of a slow, excruciatingly painful demise. In my opinion, he got off too easy.

If you're looking for an entertaining read, you've definitely found one in CC's Wyndham Legacy.
