I Loved this book. Torey Hayden is one of the best authors that writes about her own experiences working with special needs or difficult children. This child in the book, Shiela, comes from a neglectful background. She doesn't speak. But Torey works her magic, as well as uses as much tlc and patience with her as she can. It is a great book, but it is sad because you read what this young child has to go through in her young life. Torey also has other books out there too that are about her expereices and learning journeys. There is a followup to this story about Sheila, it is called The Tiger's Child . Both are really good.
