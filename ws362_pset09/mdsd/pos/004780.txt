To all Kinsey Millhone fans and to those who are yet to be, this is a most enjoyable read. PI Kinsey Millhone has been hired by a woman to reopen the old case of her mother's disappearance, 35 years before. Violet Sullivan was the local party girl, living in a tiny town with her wife-beating, drunk husband and her young daughter. One day Violet was seen driving around town, showing off her new, flashy convertible, and a few days later, she's nowhere to be found with the locals tossing up as to whether she ran off with a lover or that her no-good husband murdered her and somehow got rid of the body and the car. Kinsey questions the locals who are still living in the town after 35 years and stirs up some resentment and unrest among them as old secrets and rivalries come to life and what is, on the surface a typical small town with quiet, law abiding people, soon reveals itself as a seething mass of jealousies and bitterness. Kinsey narrows her search down to five possible suspects, men who have their own reasons for getting rid of poor, dumb Violet. It was a very good read, quick and not too involved, but holding the readers interest to the very end
