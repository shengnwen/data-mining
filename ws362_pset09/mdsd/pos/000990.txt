Any lover of old-time radio can find plenty to enjoy in Two O'Clock, as the story reeks of period detail and interesting geeky background of the era.  Still, unlike Dunning's Bookman series, I had trouble with the verisimilitude in this story, which had to work hard to maintain the connection to the stories of the radio people and still keep the mystery alive.  

Nonetheless, recommended
