This was a very informative book.  Mixes the historical information of the Hell's Angels (and other motorcycle groups), with enough details of their activities to keep the reader interested.  Very descriptive, made you want to take a shower to wash all the grease and testosterone off you after each reading.  Captured the attitude of the times very well.  Couple parts where it got a little graphic, but rang true.  Would have liked to have had more recent information on the subject, but understand this book was written some time ago.  Seemed to be a very accurate depiction (balanced) on all sides; the motorcycle gangs, the attitudes of the general public and the authorities and how they interacted and were perceived.
