Tom Piazza very compelling makes the point that if we allow New Orleans to die -- and her survival is no sure thing, even as the anniversary of the hurricane approaches -- we have allowed America to destroy through incompetence  something precious and irreplaceable. 

In part 1 he evokes the New Orleans residents and tourists love -- if you've ever been there, you'll enjoy the parade of places, events, names you'll recognize. 

That good feeling sets you up for Part 2, just as the residents of New Orleans were set up for disaster when Katrina hit. 

As Part 2 unfolds Piazza achieves a feat I have never seen another author do so well. He MAKES you feel what it was like to be a New Orleans evacuee, returning to find what happened to your home.

READ THIS BOOK... and expect to be changed by it.
