THE ENDING CAME FROM LEFT FIELD, DID NOT SEE IT COMING.  I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FIRST TWO THIRDS OF THE STORY.  VERY DISJOINTED AND CHOPPY AND NOT VERY INTERESTING. SEEMED TO SKIM OVER HIS CHARACTERS, LIKE A CONDENCED VERSION.

I AM HUGE FAN OF JAMES PATTERSON AND HAVE READ EVERY BOOK OF HIS.  I TRULY ENJOY HIS SHORT, QUICK TO THE POINT CHAPTERS.  THIS WAS NOT UP TO HIS USUAL PAR.  I FELT CHEATED AFTER FINISHING IT.  LIKE, WHY DID HE BOTHER.  KNOW IT WAS NOT FOR THE MONEY BUT THAT IS WHAT IT REMINED ME OF, DID IT FOR SPENDING CASH.  

WITH THAT SAID I HAVE PRE-ORDERED HIS NEXT TWO BOOKS.  STILL A HUGH FAN...
