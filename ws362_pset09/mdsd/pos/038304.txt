When they arrive in Hello, the resident mechanic tells them the vehicle needs a new engine.

Unable to pay for the repair, Ivy gets a job at the library and Abilene obtains work training to be the vet's assistant.  Lawyer Kelli Keifer invites both women to stay at her uncle Hiram's home now empty since he was murdered two months ago.
