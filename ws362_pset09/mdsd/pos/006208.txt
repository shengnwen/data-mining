I have read "The Prince" previously...both in school, and then again as an adult. On a whim, I ordered this book and had a nice "sit down with a good book evening" and really found myself enthralled with Machiavelli's view of the world and how it has shaped political thinking all the way until the current time. Reading Machiavelli's "Art of War" was the perfect compliment to "The Prince". I was also grateful to the editor for not inserting unnecessary commentary or attempting to color Machiavelli's opinions with irrelevant material
