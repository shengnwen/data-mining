This is a wonberful book for all who are nostolgic for the time when there were genuine, larger than lfe sports heroes. This wonderful reflection on Babe Ruth includes numerous photyographs. It is not an in depth biography. Rather, it is an evocative collection of pictures and anecdotes that he;p us feel as though we were there when the Babe was in his prime. Great book!!
