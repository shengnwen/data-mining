I can't say that I ever had this book read to me as a child and I think that that omission was a shame. This is a lovely tale about parental love with some fun on the side.  (All of the mayhem and running around for a drink of water!)

As Mr. Volkersz has so ably described the book/story/plot  (below) I shall only say that once again Paul Galdone has done a great job with his drawings.

Four stars. Good, silly fun, but not a book that I would want to read over and over and over as it takes alot of breath. LOL
