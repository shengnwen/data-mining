I used to eat well at my church in Little Rock, AR.  When I was younger, a church tea was an occasion for me to get out or sitting through service without getting in trouble.  I would be in the back, helping the church ladies prepare.  I loved how everyone had a signature dish that generated multiple requests for the recipe.

This book takes me back to those socials.  It contains the varied and quirky dessert recipes that made the teas and dinners special.  There are lots of recipes here and the pictures remind me of the women I looked up to when I was younger.  You should be able to find a number of recipes to use for your next bake sale, tea or Sunday dinner
