I am always wary of books built around the "lessons" of the Bible, Shakespeare, or any other major source unless I know the author well.  Since I have read the Bible, Shakespeare and many other sources, I feel capable of drawing my own conclusions.

This book grabbed my attention after I realized that relatively few people do read the entire Bible these days.  It could clearly be a good thing if people learned more about the Bible because they were interested in some other subject.

With that thought in mind, I launched into The Bible on Leadership.  I was glad that I did.

Mr. Woolfe does a solid job of drawing on both the old and new testaments to exemplify honesty and integrity, purpose, kindness and compassion, humility, communication, performance management, team development, courage, justice and fairness, and leadership development.  To these examples, he adds contemporary business leaders as well.  From his small list of modern leaders as exemplars of good practices, you will get a sense of how much we need people to read and apply this book.

Like many books that attempt to use current examples, you will find yourself faulting some choices (possibly including the references to Jack Stack as being too much, Warren Buffett's possible reinsurance-fraud awareness, Ray Gilmartin's honesty preceding the Vioxx debate, and various other one-time icons who have since fallen from public grace). 

As a result, I suggest that you focus on the Biblical leaders and mostly ignore the rest.  You will be on sounder ground if you do.  If you are primarily looking for modern examples, you will probably be disappointed in this book.  There are too few of them, and many good choices are omitted.  

Mr. Woolfe writes well and he makes Biblical leaders come to life.  If you only strive to emulate one of his many examples, you will be a better leader
