This novel of Kate Chopin's is based loosely on the (possibly) true story of a women who was infamous in New Orleans when Chopin lived there.  Yet despite the truth of the story and its message, society rejected Chopin following the publication of The Awakening.  This short novel is not about adultery, or glorifying suicide.  It is a powerful statement about the power that people, and especially in Chopin's time, women, have to control their lives.

Chopin develops the character of Edna Pointellier to demonstrate the ways that even those who seem as though they should be happy do not fit into the place assigned them by society.  Throughout the book, Edna Pointellier is contrasted with Madame Ragnitolle, a woman who is naturally suited to the role of wife and mother.  This novel is a reminder that there is no one life which can fit all people, whether the life of a mother or an artist or a working woman.  People must be free to make their own choices.  In many ways, that message is as revolutionary today as it was a century ago
