Perhaps I am just new to this type of analytical writing, but I found this book absolutely fascinating.  True, the first part was deep, but it was worth wading through.  I picked it up because I am tired of Harry-bashing and wanted to see what these guys thought.  I kept reading it because I liked what I read.  I found I had to keep a piece of paper in the book to keep a list of other things they recommended, and have been reading their recommendations ever since and loving it all.  I am now reading Lawhead's "Taliesin" because of "From Homer..." and have been fascinated by his (Lawhead's) quote of the "Mabinogion." Actually knowing how the two books are related makes it all that more interesting.  I highly recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in any genre from Faerie to Myth and how Christians should intelligently approach these types of books.  HIghly recommended too for homeschoolers at the high school level for English Lit credit
