This is the play where the Percy rebellion begins and centers around the Achilles-like Hotspur.  Eventually, Hotspur (Henry Percy) and Prince Hal (Henry Monmouth - later Henry V) battle in single combat.

We also get to see the contrast between these young men in temperament and character.  King Henry wishes his son were more like Hotspur.  Prince Hal realizes his own weaknesses and seems to try to assure himself (and us) that when the time comes he will change and all his youthful foolishness will be forgotten.  Wouldn't that be a luxury we wish we could all have afforded when we were young?

Of course, Prince Hal's guide through the world of the cutpurse and highwayman is the Lord of Misrule, the incomparable Falstaff.   His wit and gut are featured in full.  When Prince Hal and Poins double-cross Falstaff & company, the follow on scenes are funny, but full of consequence even into the next play.

But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare.  Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing.  However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue.  Most of us need help in understanding the text.  There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived.  There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.

For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.  

-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.
 
-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources.  We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.

-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.

However, these extras are only available in the individual editions.  If you buy the "Complete Plays" you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much!  Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around
