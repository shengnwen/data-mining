This is the first book that I have read by George Eliot. I have serveral others of hers but I alway seemed to have another book I wanted to read.  In fact, I started Adam Bede once and was about 150 pages into and put it down.  After 6 months or so, I decided to pick it back up and I am glad that I did.

This is a wonderful story about a person who is true to himself and to those around him.  This is also a story about how the actions of a person affect more than that person and those immediately involved.  

The only problem I had with the story (and thus the 4 stars) was the dialect of the language used in the book.  It is difficult to get used to the dialect and it is difficult to know what the character is trying to say.  However, after the first 200 pages, I did get the hang of it but it was difficult going at first.  In fact, it was because of that difficulty that I put the book down before.

I was glad to have read this book.  It does have a shocking part to it though it is subtle at first.  What really helped me was to read several chapters and then go the the sparknotes and read them to make sure I had not missed anything which was a big help in fully understanding the story. I would recommend that if you read this book, read the sparknotes after every 4 or 5 chapters.

I would also recommend this book to anyone that likes Thomas Hardy and espcially his "Far from the Madding Crowd."  I loved "Madding Crowd" and this book reminded me of it.

I truly recommend this book to anyone that likes English Classic Literature.  Once you get the hang of the dialect you will like this story.  If you read this one and have not read Thomas Hardy's "Madding Crowd" I would recommend that you read that one as well
