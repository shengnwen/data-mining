One of the few architecture books at the brick and mortor bookstore that isn't sealed shut with shrink wrap. After I flipped through it I  immediately bought it through amazon. It is designed by Cranbrook design  superstar Lorraine Wild, the design perfectly represents what Morphosis is  about. I take it from the other reviewers that they only looked at the  images and did not read anything at all because they did not &quot;get  it&quot;. Their work is delivered as a cyberpunk novel outtake, the setting  an industrial dance club with torture devices. There is a wonderful surreal  short story that acts as a sort of guide to viewing the work as well. I am  not an architect but this is inspirational enough for me to spend half a  decade in school to become one. Reminds me of the Jean Tinguely book  published in the early 70's (with sketch overlays) and a similar design  philosophy as Low/Te
