Okay, I KNOW I'm a little biased, being an astronogrl and all, but this book is an AMAZING read!  It reads like a novel, and yet contains so many interesting astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology concepts, that it will blow you away.  Covers everything from the big bang to inflation to black holes to string theory to dark matter...  Dennis Overbye (the author) has hob-nobbed with so many big names and been able to glean personal interviews that you begin to feel like you know these people and their astronomy struggles.  And don't worry;   This book contains no equations.  This book makes me excited to do astronomy and it is the best book I have read this year and will always remain one of my favorites
