I always enjoy Kathy Reichs books. The forensic parts are amazing to me and I particularly like her realtionships with her sister, her daughter, her cat, and most of all Ryan. 

The mystery part kept me on the edge of my seat. Because I do know something about cults, I found the plot to be right on--even though I was hoping things might turn out a bit differently.

It's always great to read one of these books when Reichs is describing winter in Canada.

Because the heroine of my books is also named Tempe, I feel very close to Tempe Brennan.
