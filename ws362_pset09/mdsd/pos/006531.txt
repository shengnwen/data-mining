This is a very pleasant book to read especially when your Mother is dying. I will pass it along to any friends I have who may be going through what I am going through. It tries to reassure us that there is an afterlife and that people can communicate back to us from there. If I find out after I die that it can be done, I'll come back and write a better review! The most interesting part to me was reading how the author happened to put this book together.
