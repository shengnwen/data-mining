Managing Cybersecurity Resources: A Cost-Benefit Analysis  is excellent! Information security practitioners will appreciate the insightful economic analysis on how to determine the right amount to spend on cybersecurity projects and how to prepare a business case to justify such projects.  I especially liked the chapter on risk that included perspectives and analysis not found in any other information security  books.  The book discusses many topics (for example, economics of cybersecurity and its role in national security) in a  manner that novice and expert alike will find appealing. Its clear that the authors, chaired professors from a top business school and pioneers in cybersecurity economics, have a strong understanding of the security environment along with great technical skills.  Of more importance, is their intuitive understanding of problems in the cybersecurity trenches.  Policy makers, CISOs, CFOs, and managers at all levels, should find enormous value in this book.  While at times I wish the authors would not have condensed their discussion, the good news is that they have left some important issues for a follow-up book.  I am recommending this book to co-workers and friends.
