Every American should read this book to understand the agonizing complexities that face the President of the United States, no matter who holds the office.  Halberstam, without taking sides, leads us from Bush Sr. to the end of the Clinton presidency brilliantly, painting perceptive and memorable portraits of not only the events, the debates that went into the big decisions, but also of the cast of 20+ characters that made up the key personnel in these administrations.  An irreplacable book
