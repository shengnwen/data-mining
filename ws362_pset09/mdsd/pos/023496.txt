I first found Ted Dekker in Goodwill while I was hunting for games for my old school super nintendo (SNES). His book, BLINK, caught my eye and I did my 'Is it a good book?' test on it. I opened to the middle pages and read both and was entrapped. 

From that moment in Goodwill I havent been able to put Dekkers worlds out of my mind. And this series is no different. After I found and bought this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished the whole series, which I did in 5 days.
