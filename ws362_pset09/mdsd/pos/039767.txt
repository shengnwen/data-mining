This play is humorous but quite an impressive piece at the same time.  There are some lovely bits in it, and if it is staged correctly, you're sure to get a lot of laughs by the end of the night.  Einstein and Jonathan  can really carry the show if they're cast well for each other, and Elaine  adds a young face to the ensamble.  A wonderful production
