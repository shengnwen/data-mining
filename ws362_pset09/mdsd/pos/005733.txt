Claudia Barron was living the high life in London with good clothes, a nice home, and social friends but it all came to an end when her husband was arrested and sent to jail for fraud. Claudia was being hounded by the newspapers and photographers so she decided to leave London and head off to the small Dorset village of Court Barton to start a new life. She changed her name to Claudia Knight, rented a small cottage, and got a job at a local school as a cook. She is trying hard to keep her past life a secret but circumstances beyond her control are forcing the truth out. 

Blackthorn Winter is a special treat to read if you are a fan of Maeve Binchy or Rosamunde Pilcher. The first chapter is a little bit confusing because of how it opens but stick to it, you will not be sorry.
