When I got this book I hadn't heard anything about it, and what I loved so much about Faith of My Fathers was the family history.  While I enjoy reading McCain's self-narrated adventures, my favorite part of his first book was his perspective on his father's and grandfather's service.  I feared this book would be more self-indulgent.  To my pleasant surprise, here McCain tells us about his other, non-relative heroes, and the results are as good as Faith of My Fathers.  He also details the Keating Five scandal and his bid for the presidency, and his attitude is self-deprecating and occasionally regretful. McCain is still one to keep an eye on in politics - he's bound to keep stirring things up for years to come
