 Kendall Deaton is a public defender in South Carolina, dedicated to her profession and seemingly happily married to a man that is devoted to her. However, nothing is at it seems to be. Her husband, father-in-law and many of the towns leading citizens are members of a violent white supremacist group. They are ruthless, willing to brutally murder anyone that they dislike or stands in their way. 
 Once Kendall learns the truth, she is in great danger and is given an FBI escort when she is being transported along with her infant. However, they are in a car crash and her escort suffers from amnesia. She then adopts the role of his wife as a way to avoid detection by the people who are trying to hunt her down. The role is well-played, although there is an ending that is totally unexpected. You expect her to emerge unscathed, but there is a twist to how it all ends that I never anticipated. Throughout the story, there are occasional additions to the plot that add tension and make the story much more interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
