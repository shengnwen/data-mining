I you have ever wondered how pop up cards work, and wanted to try them, this is the book for you. The basic principles are explained and shown very well. If you work through this book in order, you will be able to make pop-ups and sculptures that will amaze you. All you need is this book, a pencil, scissors and typing or copy paper. Give yourself plenty of time. The individual projects are not hard, but you will not want to stop. The only criticism I have is that some of the more complex projects, toward the end, could use a little more explanation.
