This series just gets to be more and more fun.  I love Holly Winter and her two beautiful Alaskan Malamutes.  This book delves into the world of working dogs, more specifically hearing aid dogs.  Dogs are wonderful aids for people with all kinds of disabilities.  Ruffly is an adorable little mixed breed that lives with a woman who is hearing impaired, and believe me, he takes his job seriously.  And we also have a murder to deal with.  A murder that it seems only Holly thinks is a murder.  The denouement of the murderer is also fun because we have Holly backed by her trusty Rowdy who do the unmasking.  This series is definitely for dog lovers, but even those who aren't as fascinated by dogs as some of us will enjoy this warm and wonderful series
