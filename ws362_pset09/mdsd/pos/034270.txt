Reading this "popular science" book, written by one of the greatest contemporary chemical physicists, was both difficult and satisfying. To avoid a fit of sycophancy, let's just say that I wish I had it when taking my postgrad Statistical Mechanics class. The only negative thing I can cay about this book is that the discussion is somewhat eclectic; it often oscillates between almost trivial philosophy and very high-level, cutting-edge science. It is not clear what the reader is expected to know before starting on this book. That said, if you can work your way through it, you will likely come out with a new understanding of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the physics of complex systems.
