I purchased this book with every intention of reading it but after almost a year I had not gotten to it.  Fortunately I was able to get the entire work in an unabridged version on audio cassette.  The subject covered was one that was hardly new to me.  However, Goodwin takes a unique and fascinating perspective that allows the reader or listener to actually feel that they are a part of history.  For those who don't have time to read, consider the audio version. It's well worth the listen
