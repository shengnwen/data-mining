"Tested Advertising Methods" is one of those rare books that, for a genuine ad guy or girl, has maintained its potency and worth through a thousand social trends and industry changes.  No, Caples never imagined web ads, cell phone text messages, or many other "new" points of contact out there today, but that's exactly why the book is perfect.  His lessons are so concrete and fundamental that they even apply to media, attitudes, and environments that evolved decades AFTER the book first went to print.  And, when you apply his thinking right, it not only never gets in the way of great, concept-based creative work, it helps you make it better. 

In fact, this is one of the books that I have aspiring copywriters, art directors, OR account people who interview with me buy, read, and re-read...because it's more than a map to better ads, it's a rudder that "gets you there" successfully, wherever you need your ads to go.  If you actually learn Caples and use his lessons, it increases your chances of developing better copy AND concepts a hundred fold.  And when you know Caples, you also have a lot of ammunition for overcoming those arrogant, self-satisfied office politicians we all sometimes have to get past to create smarter work.

Yes, a serious copywriter should also read Claude Hopkins, David Ogilvy, Rosser Reeves, Bill Bernbach, Tom McElligott, Luke Sullivan, and Ray Welch.  But Caples is a solid foundation for building your house of ad knowledge
