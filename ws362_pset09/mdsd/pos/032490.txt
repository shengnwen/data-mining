This was the second Johansen book that I read. I picked up Firestorm on CD to listen to during a long drive and instantly, I was hooked. The characters were memorable and the dynamic between them was incredible. I admit that this a little bit of a "chick" book  (the fairy-tale ending is a perfect example of this) but I was holding my breath towards the end. Since then, I've read some of her others, but this is one of the best ones she's written. Bernadette Dunn did a great reading of it, which only helped me get really involved with the story. I hope that she writes another one with Kerry and Brad
