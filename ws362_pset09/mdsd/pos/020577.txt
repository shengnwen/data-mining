I read it in the last 3 weeks before my test - it's pretty much all of the info covered in Kaplan's Step 1 review course. It's just condensed very well, the font is a lot smaller than Kaplan's and there's a lot fewer (space taking) pictures and diagrams.
Great guide to consider if you suddenly realize that your exam's here and you haven't done any reading yet, or if you've done all your prep and just wanna carry one book to the library to revise from (as against the whole lot of course books or kaplan's prep guides)..
