This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now.  Hence the four stars instead of five.

Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price. 

I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough!  This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view.  Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not.  It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly
