This time our heroine, park ranger Anna Pigeon, is stationed on an island in always-cold Lake Superior, and one-too-many bodies show up two hundred feet down on a 1927 shipwreck. Anna, no lover of the deep and a bit claustrophic at that, must dive on the wreck to investigate, then dive again to resolve. Brrr. Even in the heat of a midwest summer, this novel gave me chills.

Nevada Barr is a national treasure. Having now read all her books, I can't wait for her next one
