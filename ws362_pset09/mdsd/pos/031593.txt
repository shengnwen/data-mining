If this Whyte is so smart about the Roman era in England, why does he misuse the word DECIMATE like every other ignorant John Q. Public?  From context, he means DEVASTATE (p. 414 paperback).  Decimation was a punishment used within the Roman army: if a unit had misbehaved badly enough, one in ten (10%) of the members of that unit were killed, I believe by stoning, and the killings were performed by their fellow soldiers in that unit.  Certainly a severe punishment from an emotional standpoint but not catastrophic to the military function of the unit.  Devastation, of course, means a severe level of destruction, certainly more than 10%.  Mr. Jack Whyte has at least one foot of clay
