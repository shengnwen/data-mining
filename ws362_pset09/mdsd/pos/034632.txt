The tools the authors advocate in this book are effective and easy to work with in any organization.  They are simplistic but surprisely effective.  They are not a silver bullet for all the ills of an organization.  However if practiced, they will lead to a better work environment.

As with many management tools, the policy advocated in this book are not a cure for all organizational difficulties.  In organizations that don't care for their workers, this policy would not work.  Organizations using only this method will not become more profitable.  This is just one of many tools a manager should use in leading his/her organization
