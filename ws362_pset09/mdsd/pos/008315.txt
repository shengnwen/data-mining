I just finished reading Terry Eagleton's Literary Theory: an Introduction for the third time in 10 years, and was even more impressed than before. I agree to a large extent with the other reviewers on this thread who called Eagleton to task for his obvious biases. From the beginning of the book, however, Eagleton makes it clear that his is a biased history of modern literary theory. While he eventually slams most of the theories he presents for one reason or another, he also has the admirable ability to present each theory in a favorable light before saying what he thinks is wrong with it. Again and again I found myself won over by a theory only to have it torn apart, after which he would present the next theory and I would say "Ah! Now this is more like it" - at which time he would pull the rug out from under that one.

 

The important thing to keep in mind when studying any account of critical theory, including and especially this one, is to be critical. It would be as much of a mistake to take Eagleton's word as gospel as it would anyone else's. If you read this with what psychologist Charles Tart called an "open mind, discriminating mind," It's a fine overview of a dense and potentially hermetic field of study. Eagleton doesn't provide the final word on any of these theories, but I think this book is an excellent jumping-off point for further inquiry
