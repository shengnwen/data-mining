This is a nice hardcover book w/ a lot of good photos.  It is good for getting ideas, but the text is really not well researched and more of an advertisement for the books contributors.  Still it is nice to get additonal glimpses into what is currently being done in the &quot;bungalow&quot; style today.  Do not buy this book if you're looking for meaty text and good instruction.  Do buy this book if you are interested in some nice photos to give you some detail ideas and insight into todays bungalow stylings.  It makes a nice addition to your bungalow library
