Black Cherry Blues is the third book in James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux series, and thankfully, it is a lot less dark and depressing than Heaven's Prisoners, book number two.

Robicheaux has resigned from the Iberia Sheriff's Department to concentrate on his boat-and-bait business.  Early on, he runs into an old college roommate who needs some help.  Dixie Lee Pugh works for an oil drilling company, where he overhears two of the company's hatchet-men brag about murdering two men.  When they learn that Pugh overheard them, his life is in danger.  So when Robicheaux starts snooping around, he is also threatened.  Robicheaux goes after the two with a chain, and the next day, one of them is dead and the other (Harry Mapes) has disappeared.   Robicheaux is arrested for murder.  Once he posts bond, he travels to Montana to find Mapes.  What he discovers there is a complicated scheme involving both the oil drilling company and the mob trying to cheat Native Americans out of their land.  Robicheaux's former partner, Cletus Purcel, is involved and working for the mob.  They parted under bad circumstances in Neon Rain, but slowly, Robicheaux comes to forgive and depend on Purcel.  

Burke writes about Louisiana and New Orleans as a person with a true love affair for this area.  In his writings and descriptions in Black Cherry Blues, it is obvious that he also has a strong affection for Montana.  But Burke's formula hasn't changed any and Robicheaux continues to lack subtlety or discretion as he tries to clear his name.  As one federal agent tells him, "you want to write your own rules on a day-to-day basis."  Also, for a smart cop, Robicheaux always manages to walk into an ambush without a clue.  It's a stretch that Robicheaux is still alive after all the scrapes he gets into, book after book. 

Still, Black Cherry Blues is a fine book despite some minor flaws, and Burke has become one of my favorites.
