Although this book is targeted at young people in the 10-14 age bracket, I enjoyed it very much as an adult.  I purchased it for my grandson and he has called me up to tell me "what happened next" two nights in a row.  Engaging characters and an important life lessons are neatly woven into an adventure tale of two young people in a little town over a hot summer.  If you buy it for your children or grandchildren, read it first.  You'll enjoy it.
