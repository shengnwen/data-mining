I read the original Hardcover version last winter and was thrilled with it!  However, I wanted more from Judith McNaught and EBYT.  And in the Special Edition I found it.  Ms. McNaught's trademark poignancy brought tears to my eyes, her humor made me laugh out loud, and her further development of the characters enriched the storyline.

Judith listens to her readers which makes her unique among authors.  I recommend this new Special Edition to loyal and new readers of romance and Judith McNaught
