With Shadow Man this series is getting more and more into the supernatural. In this case, the supernatural is an integral part of the mystery but a part of which the protagonist never becomes aware. I have enjoyed this series from the begining, more so since the principal character switched from Scott Parris to Charlie Moon. His relationships with women would have seemed unusually straight laced in the 50s. Today they seem unbelievable for anyone not belonging to the most fundimental of religious sects. This tends to get in the way of the plot for me. None the less, I do recommend reading these books if you enjoy amusing mysterys
