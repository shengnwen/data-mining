A very quick reading book , but by far one of the funniest I read. It's a book for all grandmothers everywhere and when the grandmothers are finished pass on to your daughters who will also enjoy the read. It hit home in so many ways, with truths that moms and daughters everywhere share as they grow up together. Just an enjoyable hour well spent reading why I love being a grandmother (well really a grandjoy)
I knew before I read this book what my role as a grandmother was but this little book proved it
