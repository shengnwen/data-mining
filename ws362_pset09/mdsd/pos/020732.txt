This is an incredible book! Milt Hinton was born in Mississippi, raised in depression-era Chicago, and embarked on a career as bassist with Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, and then as one of the first black musicians to cross the color line in the New York recording studios. The whole time, Mr. Hinton was documenting his travels in exquisite black and white photographs, which appear throughout the book. Hinton's memory is as sharp as his photographic skills, and the story telling is just marvelous.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this one
