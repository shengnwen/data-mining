I happened upon this book while learning more about permaculture.  As we are preparing to plant a private orchard, this book was invaluable - it altered our approach entirely!  Being quite mindful of the ecology on our rural property, we are quite pleased that we can provide natural, healthy food for our family without altering the ecosystem that surrounds us.  As a matter of fact, we are now living more harmoniously with the wildlife.

This book provided the framework for us to devise an effective plan for our property in the Mid-Atlantic region although it was written based upon UK geography.

I would have gladly given 5 stars to this book if it had included more color photography and detailed illustrations.  Nonetheless, it's a valuable addition to your self-sustaining library
