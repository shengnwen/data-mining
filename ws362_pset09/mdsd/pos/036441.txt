When I bought this book, i blieve it was in the 5th or 6th grade. it was Christmas time and we had a Frosty's gift Shop thing. I remeber having $[...] left. Not wanting to have any money left over, I went to the table that had things for a dollar. I grabbed a random book. Companions of the Night. I didn't think to look at it, i just bought it. i put it on my shelf. It then took me about 4 years to pick it up and read it. When I did, I read it in two days flat. 6 hours on the couch to finish it. 
I have read this book countless of times. I no longer need the book. I memorized it. This book goes with me in my purse, on my night stand, and on trips. 
I hated the ending. And for all of you who hated the ending and loved the book, tpye in at google: Companion's of the Night fanfiction
people make sequals of this book. I'm making a sqeual of this book. 
so go there and most of them are integing to read. Be careful though, some people have the tendancy to start it and then leave it unfinished, making a bad cycle out of the whole thing.
Enjoy
