I loved this book when I was nine years old because I really looked up to the title character, Kammy Whitlock, a confused twelve-year-old with a widowed father. At the time, I didn't know anyone who had had to live in a stepfamily, so I was very interested in how Kammy got along with her stepmother and stepsister and baby stepbrother. I also had had a bad experience with camp, and it was reassuring to know I wasn't the only one who would rather be at home reading a book than in a camp full of snotty girls who were always mean to me. This is a cute, engaging story that's great for an afternoon read
