Whilte waiting for The Royal Flush by DNS, someone recommended this book to me. It was a lot of fun to read and being that I'm pretty particular about the books that I read, I thought the plot was original and very entertaining. I agree, it was too short. I recommend this as well as D.N. Simmons Knights of the Darkness Chronicles.
