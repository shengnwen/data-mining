This book makes Christians aware of true Grace which is in fact the thing Jesus Christ taught and in which Christians are encouraged to grow. God's Word leads Christians to a life of Grace. While the word "Grace" is mentioned often in sermons, many pulpits don't even teach true Grace, instead they often teach works and a performance-oriented "Christian" lifestyle. It seems as if most preachers and believers just can trust God for the effectiveness of true Grace as taught in the Bible, which in fact would really changes everything. True/pure Grace is powerful.
At MegaGrace there are many helpful articles and resources about the true Grace of God and its practical applications. This book is excellent and every Christian should read it
