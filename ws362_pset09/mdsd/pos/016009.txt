This book was amazing, as I have a friend with DID this book helped me understand what she goes through each and every day. What an a amazing story of what love and compassion, that Lynn and Grodan offered could do to help a person overcome, and finally intergrate. If you want to be inspired, and em-powered by the strength of the people who live through MPD/DID this is an amazing book for that.
