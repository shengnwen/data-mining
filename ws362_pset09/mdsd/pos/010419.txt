Andrew Solomon is a science writer who has taken the risky step of telling the vast, intriguing story of a deeply personal condition in the first person - which means that we follow him on an extraordinary roller coaster ride toward self discovery and healing (Solomon suffers very serious depression and tries all manner of "cures" including a death-wish desire to contract AIDS, and bizarre tribal rites in Africa) while also tracing the long tortuous history (and geography) of Depression as a subject. Our understanding of Depression, Solomon lucidly reveals, has been the subject of a centuries-long tug of war between two mindsets: those who see it as a chemical condition, and those who see it as a psychological (ie emotional) condition. As the history of civilisation veers between rational and romantic eras, so too has the understanding and treatment of Depression. Is it any wonder that a modern sufferer is torn between the talk-therapies and the chemical therapies such as Prozac?

Andrew Solomon comes down with an argument that both therapies are flipsides of the same whole - and that both have a role to play as sufferers seek escape from the bottomless black abyss. On the way he covers related subjects including Depression and suicide and Depression and creativity - and, this is the miracle of his writing and a tribute to his approach - the subject matter comes over as fascinating rather than gruelling.

If you are a sufferer, or live with one - or simply wish to know better how the human mind really works, this volume is pretty compelling. One of the best pieces of advice that Andrew Solomon cites is from a Greek philosopher who, more than 2000 years ago suggested that sufferers enjoy good wine and food, and surround themselves with good friends. A humane and enormously rich piece of science writing
