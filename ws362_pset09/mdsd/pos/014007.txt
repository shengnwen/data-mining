I purchased this book because it was reccommended reading for NERC certification. To pass that exam, it is enough to spend 3-5 days studying the NERC operating manual. There were no questions from either this book or the others reccommended for the exam.

With that out of the way, I thought Power System Operations covered a nice range of topics concisely and in non-technical terms.  It is not comprehensive enough to be a good reference book once you become knowledgable in this area. The material is not presented with mathematical rigor. However, if you work for a utility, and are seeking a non-intimidating introduction to power system ops, this book is perfect. As a sidenote: There is also a wealth of information available on the reliability region and ISO websites that will complement this text
