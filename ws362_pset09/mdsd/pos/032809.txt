Many have felt that this novel is too wordy.  My view is that the author's writing style is wordy, but every sentence is beautifully written.  I felt that I could imagine.  The story is really a character study and another look at the effects of the holocaust.  The survivors may have escaped death, but the horrors stay with them.  I do know some survivors.  All of them need sleeping pills because they can't sleep without them.  Sophie had no control over what happened to her yet she suffers from unimaginable guilt.  This novel digs into the human psyche effectively.
