Dr. Elizabeth Vliet provides an excellent overview of the complex field of hormones and HRT with compelling case histories, clear descriptions of established and cutting-edge therapies and courageous airing of controversies. This book is a must for women who wish to evaluate diet,lifestyle and treatment options in full partnership with their physicians.  Dr. Vliet is ahead of the pack on many health issues, including the fact that soy (which contains potent plant estrogens) is not a health food but an endocrine disrupter that can cause serious thyroid and reproductive system damage.  Dr. Vliet even linked soyfoods to vulvodynia several years before researchers discovered why. This is surprisingly good information and indicative of her all around ability to cut to the chase and offer real help to the many women who are "screaming to be heard."
