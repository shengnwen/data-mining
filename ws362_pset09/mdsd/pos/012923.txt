To read history as an evolution of ideas and inventions instead of a series of battles/wars or moving from one political machination to the next was most satisfying.  Even more refreshing was to read a history that includes eastern as well as western innovation with many interesting asides and anecdotes.  I've sent copies to my children and brother-in-law
