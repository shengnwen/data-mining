     The Myst series was such a wonderful series, after I found out they made a book about the history of Myst, I basically thought that it would be horrible. Grave mistake. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It couldn't get any better.
     The creators of Myst even helped make it, and they knew what they were making. The horrible thing is that these books were discontinued.
     Even if they were discontinued, it is not a reason not to buy them. They are all wonderful books and I suggest you get all of them
