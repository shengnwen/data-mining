Heather Wells life has definitely taken a turn for the worse.  Ten years ago, she was a huge teen pop sensation dating another huge teen pop sensation.  Now that her label dropped her for wanting to sing her own songs, her boyfriend dropped her for the new teen pop sensation, her mother took her life savings to Argentina, and she's working as an assistant directo in a New York College residence hall (NOT dorm), you could say life has done a complete 180 on her.  Now she's living in her ex-boyfriend's (hot) older brother, Cooper's, brownstone, while she tries to make a yearly living on what she used to earn in a week.  But when two girls in Heather's residence hall die, Heather realizes exactly how different her life is.  Even though the NYPD is disinclined to believe her, Heather knows that those girls' deaths weren't accidents.  With some help from Cooper, Heather has to catch the murderer before more lives are lost.  This chick-lit-slash-murder-mystery is one of Meg's best books yet.  It employs all her usual humor, romance, and character development, with an added bonus of a murder mystery.  This is a must-read for all chick-lit, mystery, and Meg Cabot fans.
