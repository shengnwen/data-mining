The house across the street from Cathy has a violent history.  When she was a little girl, the man of the house killed himself and his wife.  Now, a new odd couple has moved in: a woman and her mentally-handicapped son, Randy.  And with the new neighbors, a shadow has fallen over Phoenix, as a spree of gruesome, highly-original serial murders begins.  Catchy soon begins to realize that at the center of these murders is young Randy, a special boy with a special gift: murder...

"Death Instinct" is rather predictable, but at the same time it's a highly enjoyable read.  This is a distortion of the typical serial killer novel that could only have come from the mind of Bentley Little.  It's a serial killer novel for horror fans, written early in his career.  It lacks much of the macabre satire that makes his latter work such a guilty pleasure, but it is still pretty original.  It'll keep you turning the pages...and checking in those oft-ignored corners...
