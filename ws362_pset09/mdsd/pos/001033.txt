"Nine Stories" is a collection of stories written by J.D. Salinger, that were published in other media before he made his mark in literature.  Collected in this popular book, we see hints of what makes Salinger's writing an American treasure.

Of the stories, "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" is the most celebrated.  The imagery used in the stories of using an over-gorging fish to compare to a womanizer is fascinating.  Many of the other stories are unspectacular, though I also enjoyed the story of the child existentialist "Teddy" a great deal.  Other stories I wondered what point the author was leading the reader to explore.  

One of the qualities I most amdire in Salinger is that he does not tell the reader what to think is happening.  He allows an intelligent reader to fill in the blanks.  For this reason, "Nine Stories" is worth a look to see Salinger polishing his craft
