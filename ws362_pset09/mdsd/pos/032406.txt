*Opera 101* should be the perfect book for you if you know you want to learn more about opera but are having trouble &quot;getting&quot; it.  The book is written by an opera expert in a light but intelligent style, and it assumes that the reader comes to it with nothing more than a genuine desire to learn and some money to spend on recordings.  After a short intro chapter, Fred Plotkin begins with a 90-page history of opera that even seasoned opera-goers (of which I am one, I suppose) should find instructive.  Plotkin then provides an excellent chapter on opera singers and the nuts-and-bolts of attending an opera.  Almost all of the rest of the book is taken up with in-depth &quot;lessons&quot; on eleven key operas, each chosen to expand the reader's understanding in a certain direction.  Although each of these lessons is designed for you to use while studying a particular recording of each opera, they are highly instructive if you have a recording other than the one Plotkin recommends, or even if you have no recording available at all.  I would recommend this book to any serious beginner
