This book is very concise, telling you what you need to know without rambling on.  I haven't read Super Baby Food, but from what I've seen in the reviews that book is all over the place.

I'm a chef, so food is important to me.  I want my baby to eat good, healthy food, and this book makes it easy.  The recipes include foods that I wouldn't think to give babies (figs, kiwis, parsnips) and some that I can't say I've eaten myself (millet, anyone?).  

The write-up on the actual blending/storing is a little brief, so here are a few tips that I have learned:

-Don't worry about getting the texture just right as you're blending.  You'll burn out the motor on the typical household blender if you try to blend something too thick.  Add as much water as you need while blending--in addition to sparing your blender's motor, it will make your mixture easier to pour into ice cube trays.  When you go to serve, add rice cereal to thicken as needed.

-Most foods can be steamed instead of boiled.  This preserves the nutrients even more.  Also I use the water from the steaming pot in the blender.

-A food mill is great for avocados and kiwi.  These foods don't store well once blended and it takes a lot to fill the blender jar.  A small food mill will mash up one kiwi at a time.  I bought mine at Babies R Us for $10.  The mill is also good for travel.

-If you have a neighbor with a baby about the same age, then make double batches and swap.  

Other reviewers have mentioned that some foods are introduced earlier than recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  The publisher is Canadian, so perhaps the recommendations there are slightly different than in the US.  If your baby is sensitive to foods or your family has a history of allergies then hold off on citrus, fish, etc
