Michael Roberts is perhaps the leading authority on Swedish history today, and this book is extremely well written. The writing style is clear, detailed and easy to understand; one is not bogged down in a slough of meaningless facts. What is brilliant about this book as well, is that Roberts carefully places Sweden and the actions of Gustavus in context with the events happening in Europe. It covers every aspect of Gustavus Adolphus and his reign; there are in-depth chapters on Gustavus' foreign policy, the domestic and important military reform that he carried out, the king as a person etc. Roberts has also painstakingly gone through many Swedish primary sources as well; the book is written by a historian who has definitely done all the hard work to get the facts right, and more besides.  This is a book I would recommend without hesitation to anyone studying Swedish history
