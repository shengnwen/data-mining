I've read most of Dean Koontz' books and for the most part, I've enjoyed all of them. Most of his books are what I consider just sci-fi/fantasy; a good thriller read.  I think I'd have given this one a 5 if there was less fantasy.  I got the feeling he wrote this book in the hopes it would become a screenplay, a combination of a King/Spielberg wannabe.  I listened to this on audio, my Koontz first, and I found that in the midst of my road rage during rush hour traffic, I wasn't missing a lot of the plot.  I really could imagine this on film, and given the length of the audio book, minus all of the flowery descriptions, it would make a great 2 hour movie.  However, I got a pleasant surprise at the end, and I absolutely loved it.  His explanation of Armageddon vs. "Alien invasion" made the book, in my opinion.  It will make you think.  This wasn't one of his worst books, it was one of his best.  Give it a try.
