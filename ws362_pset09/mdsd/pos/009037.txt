C-L-A-S-S-I=C HIGH/low notes.  These stories are like a deck cards, all aces...... but there are way too few left. I finished "Little Sisters" (GREAT), "Farewell, My Lovely"- is recommended in the other half (earlier edition). The hook is Marlow. In times where many take the easy/cheap way out, I ride hard with Marlow.  Marlow does it with style, humor, wit, grit, and nothing less than an all american: get the job done. But in a way that is the opposite his nemesis: the monopolies of power & money.  Of course they admire and hate him.  But it just doesn't get any better than Chandler.  Need an excuse? Then read it for the wrting alone. The best!
