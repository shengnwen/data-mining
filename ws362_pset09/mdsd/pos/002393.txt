I guess that most of the readers that come to this book are somehow acquainted with Eckart and his previous work, The Power of Now. As it has beed said already, this new volume still travels over the same subject, sometimes going deeper, at others simply by giving a more specif example and still at others by gently instructing readers to "do" certain exercices. In all cases what it still ressonates (to me at least) is the subtle, but real, change (being more Awake) that his way of expressing deep truths (Consciousness) and facts about the human condition evoke after reading it. So if you are looking for a book that will inspire and "point" to a reality of "being" I strongly suggest you ready this one and  (in the case you have not ready his previous work) The Power of Now. I am sure you will not regret!
