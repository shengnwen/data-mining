My neighbor gave me this book when she was moving a couple of years ago and I moved shortly after so it satayed packed away in a box along with several other cook books until just recently.  Tiring of stopping for fast food or making the same quick meals like spaghetti or tacos, I figured I'd give this one a whirl.

I've typically found that in many of these books that promises quick, good meals in 30 minutes or whatever, that it generally takes you longer.  I don't know whether the authors are just cooking under optimal conditions or I'm just slow.  I suspect it's a bit of both.  Still even at 40 minutes or so, Beverly Mills and Alica Ross whip up some very hearty meals always with ingredients that are either in your pantry or easily found at the grocery store.  No scouring exotic gourmet food stores with this book.

The book is arranged by section starting with soups, then moving on to stews, Skillet meals, salads, Entrees, Veggies, etc...All very well formatted although unfortunately no color photography.  The recipes range from typical American fare like hamburgers and baked chicken to Asian, Mexican, and even Caribbean dishes.  My family really enjoyed the chicken Fingers Parmesan, easily made with refrigerated or frozen chicken fingers.  I also love the Potato corn chowder that was very rib sticking on a cold day.  The selection of salads is very strong too with some excellent seafood, pasta, and traditional salads.

Desperation Dinners is a solid cookbook.  It's the kind you will probably find a half dozen receipes you really like and will make over and over again
