This book was the greatest. As an aspiring screenwriter and director, it helps to get a large grasp on the industry. This book helped me enormously. It tells everything you could possibly need to know from employment in  Movies &amp; TV to minimum wage to contractual issues to what to stay away  from. Just an all around great book
