"Deep Six" is an captivating and interesting novel.  The story plot is great, the President of the United States is kidnapped while on a cruise along to Potomac River, and a deaadly nerve agent was released off the coast.  From the first page, the story captivates you so much you do not want to put it down.  This book is not as good as his other novel, "Shock Wave", which is my favorite.  He spends Some of the time, about one hundred pages, on setting up the scene.  Overall, this is a good read.  I would reccomend this to anyone enjoys a fast - paced and well written book
