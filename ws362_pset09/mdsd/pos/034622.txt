 Once again, Mr. Hannity articulates the folly of Liberal/Democratic/Socialist philosophy and it's over reliance upon modern political thinking and unproven scientific theories such as evolution and the origins of the universe.

Should "Creationism" be taught along side"Evolution" in modern science classes? Of course! Think of how much medical students at institutions such as Penn and Johns Hopkins might have gained from exposure to it!  

Were it not for the Liberal/athiest/hard left who have enlsaved the political process in this country since 1980, this would be a "no brainer" 

Keep up the good work Sean
