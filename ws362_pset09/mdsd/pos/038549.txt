This book represents some of the best contemporary erotica of any kind, and of the BDSM world in particular.  Compared to most, the setting is realistic and believable, the character's relatively well-developed and three-dimensional, the sex and domination accurate and colourfully depicted.  What's more, there is a wry sense of humour which runs through the narrator's relating of the story and its details which is smart but not too over-the-top.  Highly recommended
