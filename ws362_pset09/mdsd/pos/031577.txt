This book makes for good reading. I like the two main characters, although I feel Maura is making some bad decisions I will not go into it as to not spoil it for other readers. The story is interesting, some parts hard to believe others right on. SPOIILER ALERT:  I do not, nor will I ever believe Adam had another wife, ....I am a firm believer in creation by God and Adam and Eve were the first male and female of the human race, sorry that's just what I believe....I do believe evil is out there, in every form. Angels too, the Bible states Angels walk among us, whose to say if they are good or bad Angels??  Something to think about that's for sure. If nothing else this book and story could really get conversation going at the water cooler.  Recommended
