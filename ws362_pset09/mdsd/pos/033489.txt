William Buck brings out the metaphysical aspects of the epic tale. Rama and his brother must perform a journey that allows them to grow and understand nature and the world on the way. They must overcome many hurtles and meet with the good and bad. 
Two of the creatures I found fascinating is Hanuman who claims he is only a monkey and does not know any better. He is admonished and reminded if he is aware of that then it is no excuse. The second character is Ravana who knows in a world where there is no black and white that he is supposed to be an evil antagonist. But his role is important to the story and the world.

The illustrations by Shirley Triest are simple line drawings with shading to give an added richness to the story with out distracting from the writing.

I made the mistake of reading "RAMA" by Jamake Higwater first.  That was a bad move, as I did not understand the richness of the story until I read this version.  Now that I have a few more versions under my belt, I must say that this is my best.  In addition, I have the audio tape now it is time to start the Mahabharata
