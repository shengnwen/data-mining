Loved seeing the city of San Fancisco after reading about the local neighborhood haunts.  Lonely Planet has long been my first choice of Travel Guides.  This one was good, although it lacked some of the overall insights that I have liked in other LP guide books, and had some of the poorest photography ever edited for such a scenic city.  

I recommend the guide books suggestion of renting a mountain bike and taking in the sites of Golden Gate Park and heading out to Salsalito via the Golden Gate Bridge and taking the ferry back into town.
