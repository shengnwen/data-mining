It took me several renewals at the library to finish this book.  It takes forever to get started, and I really didn't like the main character (and he had too many names to keep track of).  But Le Guin's writing is beautiful to read, so I kept at it, and the story improved steadily.  You can see where JK Rowling got the idea for Harry Potter--straight from this book.  The magic is very well defined and limited (a must for fantasy/magic).  The tension in the was tight--when it happened finally--and there was a sound message with subtle symbolism (the yew tree and yew staff) below the surface in a Tolkien way--often missing in contemporary fantasy.  

This is a must-have for any library, it only misses the fifth star because it failed to hook me into reading it straight through
