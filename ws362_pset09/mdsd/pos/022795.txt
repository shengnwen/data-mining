I'm biased. I admit it. I'd be thrilled watching Jack fix absolutely anything, like a TV. Or a cat.

But this was a particularly good entry in the series for two reasons. 

First, because there's a huge twist in the middle of the book that you'll never see coming (a spear has no branches...), and second, the ending was actually emotional.

Wilson is the master of blending horror and action, and in this aspect, Harbingers doesn't disappoint. There's a high body county, a really fun scene in a rigged building, and some great minor characters to compliment the regulars.

But there's also a lot revealed in this book, and many secrets that were hinted at in earlier novels are finally answered.

If you've never read a Repairman Jack book before, you'll enjoy the supernatural thrills. If, like me, you're a huge fan of the series, you'll be salivating over this book. It's well worth the collector's pricetag
