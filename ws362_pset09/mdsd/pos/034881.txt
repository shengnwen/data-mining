This book describes in detail why most investors who own traditional mutual funds and common stocks should be investing in Exchange Traded Index Funds instead.  It gives detail about the lower costs, the flexibility and tax advantages associated with ETFs.  Strategies are discussed on how to effectively utilize ETFs.  After having been in the financial services business for many years, I would highly recommend this book to investors
