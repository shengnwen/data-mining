This is the third book released from these editors.  I truly adored the first one, particuarly the story from Neil Gaiman (who wasn't very popular at the time).  I thought that the second book was weak, but this book  definitly makes up for what the last one lacks.  If you loved fairytales as  a child, you should try the fairy tales that are for a more mature level
