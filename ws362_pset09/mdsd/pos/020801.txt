Yes, this is practically a college class in a book. It's in a text book format complete with section quizzes, but it's not quite boring enough to put you to sleep while reading it.

The DVD has around 2 hours of video tutorials (which unfortunately require QT to run, a program from a certain company that I deeply loathe... it's worth it for the tutorials, though) and some samples with a few images you can play with. You'll never be lost, that's for certain, but it repeats information quite often.

Overall; it's a good book that I'd recommend to anyone just starting out with Photoshop CS2. Texture artists who know their way around photoshop would probably find "3D Game Textures: Create Professional Game Art Using Photoshop" as a reference manual and guide
