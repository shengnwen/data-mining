The Wreck Of The Belle: The Ruin Of La Salle spotlights the discovery of the La Belle shipwreck in Matagorda Bay, along the Texas coast. This late vessel's artifacts provided a treasure trove of archaeological evidence about the famous explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle, and the seventeenth century French colonies that struggled to survive in the New World. Perhaps most fascinating of all, is that The Wreck Of The Belle exposes La Salle's human weaknesses. Not only was he an explorer, empire builder, and historical figure; he was also deceiver, murdered by his own crew, who mistreated his followers and lied to his king. Author Weddle must unravel conflicting accounts and innumerable threads of history to lay out the whole truth of who La Salle was, and what truly happened to him and his ill-fated ship. Recommended for history buffs, and for anyone who is wonders about the real story behind the oft-told legends of the &quot;conquest&quot; of the Americas
