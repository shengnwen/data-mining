I'd give this book 5  stars. Rosie gets a letter from her aunt to go to the fair. Her mom doesn't want to go. Finally they decide to go without their mom. Right when they get on the train their grandpa comes on. I like this because it tells me about the olden days. It also tells me about the fair. I'd recommend this book to someone  else  because if you like learning about  the olden days and fairs this book is for you.
