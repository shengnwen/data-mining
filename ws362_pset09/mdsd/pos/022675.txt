I believe that Mr. Plummer's Colonial Wrought Iron,the Sorber collection  will be the standard reference book in years to come for every metalworker  that undertakes to reproduce colonial style iron items. The photographs are  clear and show great detail. Whether you are interested in andirons or  sowing birds, tinsmith tools or hog catchers, wagon hardware or pipe tongs,  it's all here.
