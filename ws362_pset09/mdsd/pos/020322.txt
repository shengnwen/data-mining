This is a genuine book on Hoodoo as is practiced by many in New Orleans today. Not every HooDoo practioner works the root in the same way and this book details several root doctors and their varied practices. What this book will NOT give you is the "new age" weak willed bull about karma and ethics. HooDoo has no karma, karma is a hindu concept which somehow made it's way into a whole bunch of "new age" groups and beliefs. In HooDoo, the spirits you employ may either do the work or not, its up too them, based on your offerings and sacrifices
