&quot;Extravagant Universe&quot; is one of the best books on the market if you're looking to fathom the recent discoveries regarding the apparent acceleration of the universe's expansion.  Kirshner is not just an outside observer but a direct participant in the science, so you get a perspective from someone &quot;who was there.&quot;  Kirshner explains robustly how a special class of star became recruited as a sort of measuring stick for studying apparent and actual brightnesses of distant supernovae, whose unexpected dimness provides strong evidence for an accelerating spacetime expansion.  Moreover, Kirshner delves into the still impenetrable mystery of the so-called dark energy that seems to be driving the expansionary push.  Perhaps the book's best asset is its relative modesty.  While Kirshner does suggest some possible implications of the recent findings, he's careful not to go too far, noting the unanswered questions and the ease-- even probability-- that new data and interpretations may overthrow the current consensus altogether rather quickly.  Such a perspective is often missing in much of the lay science literature and is a major failing of many books on the market.  That Kirshner, who himself is on the leading edge of these discoveries, holds back in comparison, is a testament to his discipline as a scientist
