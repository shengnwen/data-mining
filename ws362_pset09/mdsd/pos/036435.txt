Forster wrote this book some time before 1914, which is utterly astonishing when you consider the society he portrays in this novel of the future.  Flying ships, automated machinery run by computers (although he does not use that word), robotic equipment to maintain and repair society's hardware, are all in their infancy even today, almost a century later.  This is science fiction that could have been written in the 1960s or 1990s.  I read this book in the early sixties, and assumed at the time that it was contemporary, not realising that it was written before World War 1.  I was very pleased to find that it was still available in reprinted form.  Highly recommended
