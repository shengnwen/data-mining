I first read this novel not long after it was first published in 1975, and have just finished rereading it for the third or fourth time.

By working within the historical framework of the times, James Clavell brings life to feudal Japan in a way that makes many of us thirst for a greater knowledge of north Asian history and culture.  It also made me question more critically the influences of Europe within this region.

'Shogun' also provided me with a hero I could admire, some idealistic behaviour I could aspire to and some wonderfully real tensions between different cultures, beliefs and values.

I have enjoyed most of James Clavell's novels, but none so much as this one.

Highly recommended.
