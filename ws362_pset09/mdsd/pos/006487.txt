1776 does an outstanding job of personalizing the key figures who became so critical in the war for independence.  ALthough the year 1776 saw repeated military defeats for the Americans, the faint glimmer of hope is apparent as the Americans begin to turn the tide in a series of minor victories that kept the morale at a manageable point.
Key figures such as Greene and Knox are discussed and shown to be indispensable to Washington's efforts.  The book also brought to light the fragile nature of the soldiers' committments to the fight...how close we came to losing it all.
Great page turner, and for those not too interested in the minutia of military campaigns, this will come as a welcome read
