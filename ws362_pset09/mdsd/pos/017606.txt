I would recommend this book to someone who just wants something to read because this book is easy to read and is a very moving story. The story was very anticlimactic. Nothing was really left for the reader to try and figure out. This story was not boring, but it could have used some more excitement. Being a Sci-Fi genre, the plot was not supposed to be believable but while reading the story you can get into the characters lives and feel how they feel about their problems. Depending upon the title of the book, I may read another book by David Almond
