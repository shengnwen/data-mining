Our modern culture, where sexual stimulation is commonplace in entertainment, advertising, and relationships, thoroughly rebukes the natural law of sexuality.  Temptations abound.  In past times, this book might have only been necessary for a small target audience.  Today, many might have instinctive reservations about same-sex marriage, but in a world where marriage is often considered a mere civil contract, how can one truly justify this?  

The prevailing culture has a superficial, soap opera-like view of marriage.  Celibacy, embryonic human life, and contraception-free intercourse are thought of as anachronisms, even by most Catholics.  And who can blame anyone for this?  We are all, in some way, formed by this powerful modern culture.  If you are looking to battle back from this formation, this book is a good start.

Short in pages but long in theology, the writing is so deep and concise that I found myself re-reading all chapters at least once, many of them twice, before moving on.  Kellmeyer does a wonderful job of building the fundamentals necessary to understand this complex teaching, and does so in few pages.

Sex and the Sacred City is essential for young adults, married or single, and especially for parents worried about the culture's impact on their kids.  At any age or vocation, the message of how to love is profound.  It makes a great confirmation or engagement gift for people interested in reading theology.  Don't bother with anyone who isn't like that.  They will put it down before the end of the first chapter, if they crack it at all.  An audiobook from Christopher West might be more appropriate for them.

This book will not empty your mind of the thoughts and images this culture has formed in you.  It will provide a knowledge foundation where you can begin to battle back from within yourself and speak about it to others.  Married, single, and religious will all benefit from a deeper understanding of how we relate to God and each other
