I've had this book for only a few weeks and I find myself using it daily, especially the sections on class drills and marketing ideas. I love the way its set-up - no heavy reading, no long theories to wade through, lots of bulleted lists and short articles that I can read while I'm stuck on hold with the phone company or waiting for an appointment. Not to say there isn't in depth information - the articles teaching ADHD kids and kids in general are excellent, as are the class management articles. Overall, this is an invaluable reference for instructors who have their own school and even for those teaching at school owned by someone else. Another excellent reference by Sang H. Kim.
