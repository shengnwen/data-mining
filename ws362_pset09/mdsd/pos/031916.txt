To my surprise, this book was just as good as BELLY LAUGHS. Very funny and blunt stories about her first year of being a Mommy. I highly recommend this book to everyone I know expecting a baby and even to those who already have children. The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is because of the length of the book. It's a short read. I finished it in one day
