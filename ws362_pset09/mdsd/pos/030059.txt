This is a &quot;can't miss&quot; read - as entertaining as it is instuctional. I've been giving copies of DYW as presents to clients of my law firm for for over two years and they never fail to please. Can't wait for more amusing self-help titles from Kevin Doyle. His work is a last bastion of quality and wit in a world turning evermore toward the mediocre and the commonplace. An enthusiastic five (5) stars
