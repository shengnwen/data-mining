Falco and friends are back in Rome. The partnership seems to be settling down into a defined pattern, as Falco slowly evolves from solo detective/agent into a respectible middle-class businessman and husband.

The novel is really more of a legal drama than the usual Falco detective adventure. In many ways, it is the story of a couple of high-roller lawyers who are fleecing an unlucky Senator and his family, and decide to use Falco as a sacrificial goat. Falco is out of his depth, and he knows it. But unfortunately for him, he's never been one to just stand by when someone else is being abused.

Fortunately, there is no sign of the forced tension between Falco and Petro and Falco and Helena that marred The Jupiter Myth. The characters once more appear to be their natural selves.

This was a good book, but it didn't quite have the sparkle that the best Falco books have had. The missing element was the offbeat wild card characters that usually make these books so fun. There were no exotic snake charmers or troops of actors or such. Even Falco's relatives were fairly dull and conventional.

I think Davis is still trying to find her way to writing about the new, respectible Falco. The character had to develop, but the problem is that now that he has developed she's not sure what to do with him
