I bought this book because I have a 7 month old baby, and don't have the time or interest in spending an hour in the kitchen making meals.  I need to get lunch and dinner on the table fast, and get on with it!  Problem was, I was grabbing unhealthy stuff in a hurry and packing on some pounds.  So when this book came out, I thought it would be the perfect solution--I could make quick, healthy meals that are flavorful and satisfying.

I have tried several recipes--the Chunky Tomato Rice soup, Hearty Black Bean Soup (so good, so easy), Veggie-Hummus Wraps (try those on a sun-dried tomato tortilla--MMMM!!) the Spanish Rice, English Muffin Pizzas, and the Crunchy Granola Peach Gratin.  My husband, who is what I call a "Tag-Along Vegetarian", (not an official vegetarian, but I'm the cook, so that's how he eats) has gobbled up all these meals and asked for seconds.

Look, this is not a "gourmet" vegetarian cookbook.  If you turn up your nose at "resorting" to bagged salad greens or frozen vegetables or tomatoes or beans out of a can, then this isn't for you.  I have the Millennium cookbooks sitting on my bookshelf, and Deborah Madison, and Peter Berley, and they're all beautiful cookbooks that make for some wonderful food.  But right now I need simple, fast recipes, and if that means some help from pre-washed spinach, so be it!  And if you feel it's easier to modify a recipe by using an appliance, well duh! Go ahead! This cookbook is all about making vegetarian cooking work for you in your busy life.  

The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I wish it was longer and in hardcover!

By the way, since joining the gym and cooking from this book, I've lost 8 pounds.  Thank you Donna Klein!!!
