If there was ever a time when we needed to be reminded that immigrants are the heart and soul of what makes this a textured, rich and interesting country, this is it.  This book and its companion museum exhibit, which I was lucky enough to come upon serendipitously at Purchase College's Nueberger Museum, celebrates the gifts we have received as a nation from the diverse people who have struggled first to get here, and then to make a life for themselves here.  Before we build walls on borders, before we villify those who are different from us, let's appreciate what we are gaining from the immigrants who choose the US as their home.  Let's remember that very few of us are Native American.  We have all benefitted from the open door to America.
