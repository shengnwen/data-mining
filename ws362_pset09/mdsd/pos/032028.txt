Once you develop a palate for different oils and have a favorite type or types of olive oil, this book is extremely helpful in guiding you towards the types of purchases you would most enjoy.  In the past, I bought many bottles of olive oil which were good, but were not of my preferred types, so I ended up feeling as if I had wasted my money.  This book has been a very helpful guide to me.  On my wishlist would be a revised and expanded edition
