Butler does a good job grounding speech act theory in political and legal  issues, particularly racist and homophobic &quot;hate speech.&quot;  She  takes Derrida's theory of iterability and shows how repetition of discourse  in new contexts can be a means of resistance.  For Butler, this is very  applied and I liked it much better than Gender trouble
