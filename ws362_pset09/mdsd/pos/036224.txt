As a child, I stumbled upon this book and absolutely loved it.  The heroine is a little witch girl living with the Old Witch, the witch baby,  and Malachi the bumblebee.  There is a sweetness and innocence that  pervades this book without making it seem too &quot;cute.&quot;  A  must-have for any Eleanor Estes fan!  Glad to see it's still in print
