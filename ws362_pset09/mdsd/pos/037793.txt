Kushner delivers a work true to its title. To Life is an energetic, meaningful primer to the Jewish religion. Kushner provides an outstanding commentary of the Jewish faith which will positively impact any Jew's decision to return to observance, as well as act as a welcoming introduction for any potential convert. (Like myself.)
 
 The one major flaw in Kushner's book has already been noted by other reviewers. Intentionally or otherwise, Kushner does slam the Christian religion a few times during the course of the text. However, overall this remains an inspiring work.
