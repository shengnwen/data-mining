When I got the first book, I thought it would be a one shot deal. Then I saw this book. I picked up, expecting a really bad sequel, and like a lot of books I've read was pleasantly surprised. Michaels actually tried bringing more life to Fisher by adding a relationship with his female Krav Maga instructer.Although it did serve as a major distraction for him

This is a great buy for fans of the game and Tom Clancy.

PARTY ON, DUDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
