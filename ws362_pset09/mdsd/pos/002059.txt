How would you feel if you were the only one to survive a boat wreck? What if you had to live on a stranded island with no vegetation or wild life; just a small pond and an untamed horse.
	Thirteen-year-old Alec Ramsey is on boat back to his home-land, New York City, to see his parents. But his plan changes when his boat wrecks. He is forced to live on a deserted island with a wild Arabian stallion. He comes to love and gain the horse's trust and they become friends. He comes to call the horse The Black.  As their trust blooms, he gets to ride The Black. When he does he is nearly thrown off due to how fast The Black can run. Will they be saved? And if they are will he get to race The Black.
	The Black Stallion is exciting, and thrilling. It was hard for me to even put the book down. I believe if you love horses that you will not be able to put the book down either. I would suggest the book to ages 8 to 12. Remember if you like this book a lot there are plenty of books that Walter Farley has written.
