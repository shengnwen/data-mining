This book is great in that it gives levels (1-4) for your pain.  When I started using this book I was dabbling between 4 and 3 alot.  4 is akin to a mouth of toothaches that are throbbing; 3 is a constant dull numbness  that takes away concentration but allows menial labour and tasks to be  performed; 2 is spasmodic pain or pain with certain movements; 1 is know  it's there at all and doesn't bother me , hey I can function!  It gives  practical ideas and hints and help on what to do and makes you realize that  sometimes rest is just necessary. Between this and Dr Michael Murray's  Arthritis book you'll be back on track before long.  Please try this book,  it is superb and truly worth your money and time.  If you have arthritis  and are really willing to work with it this book will get you there. (BTW I  am now mainly level 1!  It's a great to be alive!
