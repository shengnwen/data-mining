If you liked &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, &quot;Einstein's Dreams&quot;, Alan Watts or the I Ching odds are you'll find this book quirkily compelling.  Would have gotten 5 stars save for the too frequent gloomy bent of many of the thought exercises.  Why not a joyful instead of a &quot;dread&quot;ful bus (exercise #23) or a flying flock rather than a dead bird (#35)?  Not that everything requires the ubiquitous &quot;(:&quot; but life ain't really all that bad.  This is, nonetheless a most creative book filled with &quot;ah ha&quot; moments and poetic turns of phrase, e.g. &quot;there's no need to kill time.  It dies by itself...&quot;  Enjoy but keep the Prozac handy if you trend toward depression..
