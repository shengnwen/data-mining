I have written a number of book reviews for Amazon and tried to make them helpful and somewhat objective.  But in this case I simply want to say to any who call themselves Christians - I URGE YOU TO READ THIS BOOK!  I cannot approve on the good reviews that have already been written. I can only say that those who name the name of Christ must read this book and ask themselves if the commitment of the Church in China represents their/my commitment or not.  I found I had a great deal of repenting to do.  

The book is well written and interesting and needed.
