As a reader of many books I would say this is a good read. H.G. Wells brings some wild imagination to reality. As the time traveller travelled into the future he did some strange things but encountered many dangers. As a complete story I would say for a quick read or for people who read small novels this is very good. 

The 4 star rating means for fiction well done. But 5 stars would be a bit too much because it isn't long or a novel that goes extremely deep. For children maybe a 5 but for adults or college students it's satisfactory and a bit fun.

The future is something we will always dream about. I truly suggest this book if you want some imagination about the future or some adventure
