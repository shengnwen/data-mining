In this wonderful and thoughtful volume, Piper is teaching us. His approach to the life of Jesus and the meaning of that life spills all over this volume.

Piper takes several of the demands or imperatives of Jesus and expounds on them. He shows a commanding grasp of the Gospel narratives.  His exegesis is sound, though tempered with his overarching theological bent.  Yet it is a sensible read.
