The book Eddie Would Go was a true story about the life of Hawaiian legend Eddie Aikua. The book tells the tale of his life and about Hawaiian culture. I liked this book a lot because it helped me imagine the Eddie Aikua who was around a couple decades ago and the story made me keep reading.It was exciting and had a lot of adventure in it. It doesn't compare to any other story I've read before, it was like a biography but also at times it was like a guidedbook to Hawaiian culture. 

The things I disliked were when the author branched of to something boring or urelavent to Eddie's life. If I was to give it to someone, they would have to know a little about surfing in the early days and like lots of adventure and suspense. I would definetly recommend this book. It was one of the best books I've read so go get a copy and enjoy
