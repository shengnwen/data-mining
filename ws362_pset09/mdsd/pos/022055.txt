Depending on your outlook, author Gay Talese's rambling social history of sex in America is either X-rated titillation or scholarly and objective reporting of a serious subject that affects virtually everyone.  The author takes the reader through a maze of people and events from the triumphs and tribulations of Hugh Hefner to pornography and the courts, from free-love religious sects of the 19th century to 20th century California communes.  The reader also visits massage parlors and organized mate swapping clubs.  The premise is that everybody behaves sexually, regardless.  Pretending otherwise is a myth perpetuated by the oppressive cycle of American Puritanism handed down by a variety of parental, religious, and legal authorities.  We should just accept our sexuality and be honest with each other, and especially with ourselves.  Although the author refrains from preaching a &quot;if it feels good, do it&quot; sermon, complete sexual freedom is the rather trite theme.  This viewpoint is somewhat dated and reflects the so-called sexual revolution of the '60s and early '70s.  The book was published in 1980 before the AIDs threat was a common concern.  Some hot button issues as abortion and homosexuality are ignored.  Nevertheless, it is an interesting book on a controversial subject. ;-
