Even as an adult, I find these mice so adorable!  It is a cute tale that also teaches the child about colors and color combinations.  

As an adult, I laugh over and over at the subtle humor hidden in the pages.

It reads pretty quickly for smaller children, giving time to ask the children to interact with the page ("Where's the RED paint?", "What color do you get when you mix RED and YELLOW?", etc.) before they get bored.

Such a sweet little tale.  An artist at heart, and a clutz at that, I can totally connect with the little mice
