Nutritional yeast is one of those few miraculous foods that all vegetarians/vegans have to be thankful for.  First, nutritional yeast is grown off of blackstrap molasses.  It is jam packed with fiber, protein, and tons of B vitamins, especially the highly debated B12. This cookbook makes it very easy for you to incoporate more nutritional yeast into your eating lifestyle.  Be careful, Brewer's yeast is NOT nutritional yeast.  This cookbook features recipes that are not suitable for substitution
