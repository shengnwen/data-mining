This is a fine book, loaded with familiar (and some unfamiliar) quotations.  Many of them are ancient-demonstrating the wisdom of the past. 
[Note: all the quotes below are from Familiar Quotations, John Bartlett, Little, Brown & Co., Boston, 1968]

Frequently, they reveal who said a familiar bit of wisdom:
p. 86a: "Every man is like the company he is wont to keep."  Euripides, Phoenix, fragment 809
or
p. 91a: "Let each man exercise the art he knows. You cannot teach a crab to walk straight."  Aristophanes, Peace, 421 B.C., l.1083
or
p. 74b: "A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step."  Lao Tzu, The Way of Lao Tzu, p. 64

Sometimes there are several saying much the same thing in different words:
p. 125: "While we stop to think, we often miss our opportunity."  Publilius Syrus, Maxim 185
vs.
p. 125: "You should hammer your iron when it is glowing hot. (Publilius Syrus, Maxim 262;
and
p. 123: "Once a word has been allowed to escape, it cannot be recalled."  Horace, xviii, 71
vs.
p. 123: "It is as easy to recall a stone thrown violently from the hand as a word which has left your tongue."  (Menander [343-292 B.C.], Fragment 
or.
p. 123: "Thoughts unexpressed may sometimes fall back dead; but God himself can't kill them when they're said." Will Carlton, The First Settler's Story, 1895-1912, st. 21
and
As geographers, Sosius, crowd into the edges of their maps parts of the world which they do not know about, adding notes in the margin to the effect that beyond this lies nothing but sandy deserts full of wild beasts, and unapproachable bogs. (Plutarch [46-120 A.D.], Lives, Aemilius Paulus, Section 5, quoted in Familiar Quotations by John Bartlett, Little, Brown & Co., Boston, 1968, p. 136a.)
vs. 
"So geographers, in Afric maps
With savage pictures fill their gaps,
And o'er unhabitable downs
Place elephants for want of towns."
p. 136a: Jonathan Swift, On Poetry, A Rhapsody, 1733,

Some are humorous as well as wise:
p. 129: "I was shipwrecked before I got aboard."  (Seneca, 8 B.C.-65 A.D., 87,1, Epistles
and
p. 126: "You cannot put the same shoe on every foot."  Publilius Syrus, Maxim 596, first century B.C.
and
p. 125: "It is well to moor your bark with two anchors."  Publilius Syrus, Maxim 119

Some are reminiscent of other famous sayings or quotes:
p. 108: "Moderation in all things."  Publius Terentius Afer, c.190-159 B.C., Andria [The Lady of Andros] l.61 reminds me of Aristotle's Golden Mean or the Tibetan Buddhist Middle Way etc.
and
p. 107: "Wise men profit more from fools than fools from wise men; for the wise men shun the mistakes of fools, but fools do not imitate the successes of the wise. (Marcus Porcius Cato, the Elder, 234-149 B.C., from Plutarch's Lives, Cato, Section 8 which is reminiscent of Oscar Wilde's statement.

Some are quite practical:
p. 127: "Everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it"  Publilius Syrus, 1st century BC, Maxim 847
and
p. 123: "He who has begun has half done. Dare to be wise; begin!"  Horace, ii, 40, Epistles, book I
and
p. 108: "There is nothing so easy but that it becomes difficult when you do it reluctantly."  Terence Publius Terentius Afer, c.190-159 B.C., l.805

Some are philosophical:
p. 83a: "The good befriend themselves."  Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus, l.309
and
p. 126: "Every day should be passed as if it were to be our last."  Publilius Syrus, Maxim 633

Some are surprisingly ahead of their time:
p. 107: "Those who know how to win are much more numerous than those who know how to make proper use of their victories."  Polybius [c.208-126 B.C.], History, X, 36
and
p. 82b: "Knowledge must come through action; you can have no test which is not fanciful, save by trial." Sophocles, Trachiniae, l.592, {Which sounds like scientific empiricism to me.}

Some are quite profound:
p. 81b: "How dreadful knowledge of the truth can be when there's no help in truth!"  Sophocles [c.495-405 B.C.] Oedipus Rex, l.316
and
p. 70b: "It takes a wise man to recognize a wise man."  Xenophanes IX [570-475 B.C.], from Diogenes Laertius

And my personal favorite (that I quote frequently):
p. 134: "Pygmies placed on the shoulders of giants see more than the giants themselves."  Lucan [39-65 A.D.], The Civil War, book II, 10 [Didacus Stella
