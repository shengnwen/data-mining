1. 4 stars is slightly above average but not overtly hyped as the best.

2. Book offers valuable concepts that should be taken to heart for any investor.

3. Book really offers no major details or plans on value investing.  Just concepts, philosophy, etc.  But for the price it's ok.

For more recommended books, see my other reviews.
