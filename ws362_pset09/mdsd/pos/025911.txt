A great find.  I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't need this book.  My [...] year-old saw it on the table and picked it up and found it helpful--though I think it's too dense for most kids.  An important feature of the authors  method is to have your kids participate in the process which will help cement it.  Especially helpful if you have a child entering middle-school where the big changes of multiple schedules, moving classrooms and intense homework take place for the first time
