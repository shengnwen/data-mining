Christopher Mason reveals the ins and outs of the complex and deceptive art world in London and New York.  He has the inside scoop of what really happened.  Sure makes the courtroom drama seem like only part of the story was told on the stand.  The careers that were destroyed were not only Mr. Taubman's and Mrs. Brooks's.  The reputation of these two premier huoses in thrown into question forever. A good read, and a quick one.  The writer brings you along and you are hanging on the side of your seat to see who does what.  I recommend it without question
