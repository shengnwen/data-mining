Age of Innocence was incredibly promising for the first half of the book. The writing was funny, the characters were developing well, and the relationships seemed fresh and pleasing.

However, in the second half, Wharton loses much of her mirth, the characters become horribly unlikable, and the back-and-forth between Ellen and Archer becomes a game of ping pong that's more annoying than satisfying. 

The style of the prose is good throughout and Wharton's criticism of her own society save the book from being ultimately disappointing
