I am currently interning as a school librarian. I read to second grade, but I think it would appeal to a wider age group as well. Lil is all about books, and the details illustrated by Kellogg are as always, wonderful. My only issue w/the book is the pool table in the tavern. I think the story would have been the same w/an arcade center or pool hall,not a tavern complete w/bartende
