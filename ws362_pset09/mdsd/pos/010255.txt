To understand the histories of separate countries, one has to put it in the context of the whole world.  And this book is really good by having two parts: Part 1 (over 100 pages) is devoted to the holistic presentation of the evolution of the history of the whole world, whereby the reader can understand the interaction between countries and conduct interesting comparisons and contrasts between them on the same timeline.  Part 2 is devoted to the evolution of the histories of separate regions.  When one combines the two parts in one's mind, one's interpretation of the world history can never be the same!

History of humankind is full of politics, arts, science, achievements and frailty here and there, now and then.  This book, with its superb combination of different data formats, can really give one the primal sense of wonder generated from the history made by human beings.

If you think history is fun and exiting, your view will be confirmed by this book. If you think history is no fun and no excitement, you will have a second thought after reading this gigantic book
