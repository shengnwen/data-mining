I've said this before and I'll say this again: Lehane doesn't write mysteries, Lehane writes Literature. I see no difference between Michael Chabon, Jonathan Lethem, Richard Russo, Michael Cunningham, and Dennis Lehane. When I finished Mystic River, I remember thinking "if this book does win the Pulitzer for best fiction, then a crime has happened." I felt the same when I read Darkness, Take My Hand.

Somewhere between writing A Drink Before the War and Darkness, Lehane got really good! I've seen him a few times at signings and I've never asked him what he did or wrote between those two books that made his skills leap into a whole new categories. A Drink Before the War is good, don't get me wrong. I don't agree that it's just an action book even though there's a lot of it in there! There's substance in Drink but Darkness is so much more! Every character is wholly fleshed out and pushed to the limit. The villains are so damn evil it hurts! The violence is gut-wrenching! And the writing is so taut it's like a piano wire. This book starts off like a bullet and doesn't slow down. And I'm not just talking about the action! I'm talking about the narrative (Patrick's narrative of the story can make you laugh at times then make you cry a second later), the subject matter, the dialogue, the setting, everything!

This is why I read! Not just why I read mysteries but why I read fiction! To read something this good and profound just makes me happy to be alive
