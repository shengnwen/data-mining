Robert Ludlum is the bar that most writers who work in the international espionage/thriller genre' set their mark to.  As a writer, I fall into this catagory.  In 'The Ambler Warning' the team that has been left to maintain the Grand Master's estate, have followed course in focussing on currency and interconnected geopolitical plots that are very real and pressing in today's enviornment.  And this, giving attention of the real world through the art of historical current fiction storytelling, is what Robert Ludlum did best through his cleverly crafted stories.  

The reviews across the board are somewhat varied; however, their is no denying that if a reader engages in the thesis of the story regarding the sleeping giant that is China, and how its growing resource consumption rate has and will significantly increase world agendas, then 'The Ambler Warning' does its job in spades.  Critically, the reader should look through some of the more lengthy passages of this story, focussing on the political issues presented.  A big bonus is that the writer (s?) of this novel do include some real interesting historical facts that support the action and movement of the story.   The one writing liberty taken by the author that was hard to believe, and so , gave immediate reason to have suspecion was the somewhat immediate acceptance of Ambler to those he surrounded himself by (I do not want to make a direct statement here). Overall, I enjoyed this book very much.  Educational, interesting, and filled with some nicely created characters, this story keeps the living tradition of Robert Ludlum alive and well.
