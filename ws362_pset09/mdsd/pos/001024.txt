It is indisputable that the key to success in business lies not only in attracting business, but maintaining relationships through repeat business as well as referrals. The book does an excellent job of detailing some of the more complex principles that guide not only the creation but the growth of a successful business.

Written in plain and unpretentious language, Mr. Templeton is able to accurately transcend the abstract concepts that often underlie management theory and use real-world examples to illustrate his points. An excellent read.
