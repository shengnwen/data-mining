Well, he's not Ed Miller, he's not Dan Harrington, he's not David Sklansky, and he isn't Matthew Hilger, but Phil Gordon, while not being a teaching master like the aforementioned authors, remains a solid poker player and exciting teller of tales. His narration here, like in his other books, is bold and effervescent. In this, his Little Blue Book, he devotes over 300 pages to describing hands he's played along with the strategy behind his decision-making. Not only are his descriptions of these confrontations entertaining due to the circumstances and personalities outlined, they are also educational because Gordon has put serious thought into his analysis. I think you'll find that these chapters will flow effortlessly, and you'll wish there were more of them once you finish. I will say though that you should probably buy The Little Green Book first because it provides much more in the way of theory than this one does.
