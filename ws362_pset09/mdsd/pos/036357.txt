Like the bloke below, I read this book for school, but for the purposes of ancint history.  Yes, indeed, Marcus Tullius Cicero is the most outstanding life Plutarch saw fit to write of.  For an aspiring lawyer like myself,  Cicero embodies desireable traits and wit (although I wouldn't repeat his  joke about the Sphinx being in one witness' house!).   Penguin's edition  features: Marius, the dictator Sulla, Pompey, Crassus, and, of course,  Caesar.  These men are all fascinating by themselves, but the men of the  triumverate stand head and shoulders above the rest.  The first such  &quot;triarch&quot; was Pompey.  The contemporary reader will find some  amusement and eyebrow raising pleasure at the lively sex lives of these two  men.  Pompey bit his lovers, while Crassus lived every single man's dream:  in a cave with two slave girls.   What Plutarch sets out to accomplish is  to display these men as models--how the lust for ultimate and absolute  power was the undoing of each man.  And I'm not being ironic; all these men  were destroyed by the enemies they created, the wars they spawned, or pride  they chained themselves to
