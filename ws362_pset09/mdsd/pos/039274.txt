My son Nathan is very stubborn and doesn't like to look at &quot;words&quot;...just pictures.  Until now!  This book has enticed him to look at the word to tell him about what is going on in the picture.  For  example one page may say &quot;snake&quot; when you see the snake and  another page used the word &quot;boa&quot;.  So he looks at the letters as  clues for what to say....Hooray! He may just read one day afterall!    Thanks you
