I've read other biographies of other christian giants & pioneers, but this one stands apart because of how well the Taylors and  friends documented their lives.  Interspersed within this succinct yet colorful biography, the authors (Hudson Taylor's son and daugther-in-law) share numerous letters written to and from Mr. Taylor throughout his life.  These precious letters prove to be jam packed with spiritual wisdom and insight. They provide us with an unique "inside look" into a practical man who was utterly captured by God's purposes.
