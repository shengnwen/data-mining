This book is great. I couldn't put it down. I play the game and it opened up a whole new perspective for me. Even if you don't play the game and just like fantasy and magic, this book is for you. The story grabs and pulls you  in. Only 1 other book did this to me and that was Hitchhiker's Guide to the  Galaxy (Also read). GET THIS BOK
