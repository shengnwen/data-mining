OK, this book is very informative. Very very interesting.  Use this book along with your studies on the Nazi relation to the Vatican.  Ratlines, intelligence, etc....very interesting book indeed.  You'll have to read to see.  I also suggest you read Two Babylons and Mystery Babylon Religion.  Could this be conspiracy theory?  Hum.  Good question, you read and decide.  I believe most of it is not
