Marvelous! If you are a social history fan, a Restoration bug, a 17th Century nut, or you just love learning through insightful and witty prose, this is a book you will get lost in. It's not unlike &quot;What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew&quot;--but more gracefully written, with a fine wry view of the era. Pepys would have loved it! And so would Charles II. Don't delay--it's worth the bucks. Does anyone know anything about author Liza Picard? She's delightful
