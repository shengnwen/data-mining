Are you a storyteller? Do you enjoy hearing stories? Are you even AWARE of the stories around you? This is an insightful and entertaining work of art. I cannot recommend it enough. The authors move you through 7 principles of Jesus' communication, taking you to a deeper level of what it means to truly communicate, to be authentic in the way you lead your life and empathize with those around you. 

This book will resonate with the modern reader from its real life examples and glimpses into the lives of your authors (and you may even be surprised at how often you have been in similar situations...buzz buzz). Erik and Jedd weave together intricate stories from the past, the Bible, popular culture and modern life, painting a glorious picture of Christ's love, and how we too can learn to communicate like Christ in our every day life. Communication is about so much more than the words you use; it's about the manner in which you live your life. Get this book, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you will be amazed by the power of communication. What are you communicating?
