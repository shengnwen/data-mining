I nearly gave up after trying to work my way through the Gordian Knot of metaphors and similies in Chapter I - however - this was a very cleaverly written book and kept me untii the end.  Frankly, I would love to see another adverture with the hero. I know there is a danger repeating a success, but Ms. Flynn has a sharpe sense for character development fitting the hero between the anti and the flawed. I understand why Stephen King liked this book - I enjoyed his book about newspaper reporters/writers of a small town newspaper.  It was particularly colorful in the audio book format.
