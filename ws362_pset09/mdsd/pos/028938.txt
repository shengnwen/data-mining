This is a very inspirational book! great tutorials and very nice information about some general fields in custom painting.  If you feel you like some flame works, you'll find this book leads you to flame almost anything around you... BEWARE! maybe you never stop!

I suggest to read this book together with "How to paint your car" also from Motorbooks, this one first because maybe you'd like to start with some nice graphics before putting yourself on a whole car painting job
