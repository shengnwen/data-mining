I have recently been on something of a Bill Bryson binge.  After having read The Mother Tongue and Short History of Nearly Everything, which are two of his more scholarly-oriented books, I decided to try this book (perhaps it should be noted that I have yet to read A Walk in the Woods; this title just appealed to me more).  The stories are often clever, and despite his complaining Bryson rarely, if ever, leaves the threshold of good intentions.  You have to realize that he is a reasonable man, and some of these irrational rants are merely for entertainment's sake and should not be analyzed too closely. That said, I agree with the editorial review in that sometimes he enters Dave Barry-like hyperbole, something that I personally find cheap and overdone, although Dave Barry sells lots of books, so many people must think that style is funny.  Personally, the more subtle humor, such as the little pet names for his wife he inserts in what are supposedly transcripts of actual conversations with her, that amuses me, as well as his joyful musings on American life.  Sure, this isn't too profound, but it manages to be intelligent and critical, while maintaining a whimsical air.  I can just picture ol' Bill with a content smirk on his face while writing these articles in his house in Hanover.  To sum it all up, Bill Bryson seems like the kind of guy I would love to have over for dinner, assuming he is as entertaining in person as he is in this book
