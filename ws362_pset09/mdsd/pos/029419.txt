Even though the title advises the book is a commonsense guide to training and living with dogs, I found it to be more of a discussion of the author's philosophy of living with dogs.  You probably wouldn't take this book in hand to train your dog.  The case studies are fun to read and there is much to recommend in the author's observations on his life with his dogs.  I would, however, suggest that Mr. Katz do a bit more research on dog foods and health care for a more balanced point of view when advising others. 

I enjoyed Katz on Dogs.  Just don't take all of the author's suggestions too seriously.  As Mr. Katz himself mentions, not every training theory is for every person or every dog.  Each dog is unique (as is the human, too) requiring flexibility in training methods.  Mr. Katz does a good job of providing ample evidence of the challenges and delights of training each of his dogs and shares that with his readers.
