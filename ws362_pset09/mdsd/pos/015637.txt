I love to cook and I have an absolute fetish for cookbooks. This one satisfied those loves perfectly. I've tried about five of the recipes so far and they are wonderful, probably because her recipes make no attempts at being low-fat or healthy. I love her writing about the food--it's down-to-earth, sexy, and practical. The photography is gorgeous and the layout of the book into categories like "Party Girl," "Comfort Food", etc give the book added character instead of the regular divisions like "Starters," "Desserts," etc. This book isn't for the constant health food fiend, or even for the beginning cook (though the recipes really aren't difficult, some are quite involved)
