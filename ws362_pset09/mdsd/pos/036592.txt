I must admit I picked up this book because of the cover. However it was a fun read. I am currently taking an ecology class and this book made such an interesting companion. Holmes writes about seemingly boring topics (at least to the type that don't really enjoy science) and make it interesting. My friends are probably slightly annoyed about hearing the fascinating details of pill bugs and crows. It's a fun read, though at times it can be a bit slow, pefect for nice summer days outside
