I totally enjoyed this book. It was a mystery and suspense story with lots of background on the Chinese culture, archeology and how antiques get out of China that was fascinating. I am really excited that this is a series about the husband (American Lawyer) and wife(Chinese Detective). I look forward to reading the other two books. I understand Lisa See has written other awarding winning books, I intend to read them too
