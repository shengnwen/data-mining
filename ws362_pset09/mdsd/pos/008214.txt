A very interesting subject, and the author has accumulated a substantial catalogue of tales about murder in the seventeenth century.  "Shakespeare's England" is a little misleading, considering that virtually none of the crimes mentioned here took place before 1624, by which time Shakespeare was long dead.  While the book is interesting, the major flaw is the quality of the writing, which is redundant and rather dull.  It feels like she repeats the point that male violence was more tolerated, while female violence was more shocking, on nearly every page.  After a while, one gets the point!  Dammit!  Anyway, if you can get past the writing style, there is a lot of good stuff here
