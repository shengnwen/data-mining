This is a great read. Seth has a gift turning his thoughts, ideas and experiences into text for others to take advantage of.

I apply his learnings through my personal and business life, most recently with em3 People and Technology, an IT company in Melbourne Australia.

Highly recommended, some important lessons, and easy to read
