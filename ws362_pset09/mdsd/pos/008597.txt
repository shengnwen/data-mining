The book is well structured, and includes many photos and diagrams. I found it useful because I work exactly on the same topic. However, most of its content can be found elsewhere (in published articles). The accompanying CD-ROM includes very interesting videos, although I think they can also be found elsewhere. In summay, I definitely recommend this book, but only if you are really interested in the topic and/or in Kismet, and you want to know as many details as you can
