Every now and then, an authentic voice sings a song about life, the world we live in, and the human condition. In Ann Daum's book &quot;Prairie in Her Eyes,&quot; we hear all this, plus a symphony about the animal condition as well. I grew up in New York City. When I read Ann Daum's work, I am transported to a different world, made up of enormous skies, animal bodies and breath, and the rhythm of the seasons in big sky country. I am close to her and her world. I cry about a fox I never met. I breathe deeply about the fate of cows, prairie dogs and horses. Life takes on a new perspective and a depth that flows from the earth, the weather, the ranch, and Ann's generous and sensitive heart. Fine writing should reach out to whatever is univeral, but also speak to one human being's particular experience. &quot;The Prairie In Her Eyes&quot; has achieved this essential interweave, and I recommend it to anyone with heart or soul or mind
