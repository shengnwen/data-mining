  The purpose of this book is very helpful for teenagers. They tell stories that are very common in the teenager life and could help to solve a problem. They also tell stories that happened when they were children and affect them when they grew up. I enjoyed reading this book because it is very funy, lovely, sad, mysterious and very informative. I rate this book with five stars because it helped me and it can also help other teenagers
