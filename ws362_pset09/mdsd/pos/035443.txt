I am not a photography buff.  Saw the exhibit in L.A. at the Hammer museum.  I read magazines like "Vice", which feature alot of photogs who seem to be influenced by this guy.  I thought his stuff was awesome- very contemporary, like someone travelled back in time and shot 70s landscapes etc.

Also: it's a big book- so have ample shelf space ready if you don't want to keep it on your coffee table or on display
