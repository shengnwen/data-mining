As recounted by others, this is the  self-told history of an American university student who went to sea, around the Horn to California and back, for two years in the late 1830's, spending several months on the California coast collecting hides. In its time, its impact was due to the revelation to the public of the hard life of the common seaman and its description of California when that land was under Mexican rule. My impressions:
 1). Expect to expend some effort into "getting into" the book, as with virtually all pre-Hemingway literature (except Mark Twain). Narrative description was a forte in those days.
 2). The image of going  high aloft at night, in freezing weather and mountainous seas, with little sleep, while rounding the Horn, will be something you will never forget.
 3). The author's description of Mexican California is also memorable. Actually, the Americans already there virtually ruled the territory - they were the ones with the ambition and
energy. You will understand how San Francisco Bay could be coverted from a sparsely settled inlet to a bustling city when Dana revisited the place 24 years later. Americans ARE different.
  4). One episode - the senseless lashing of two sailors by a
sadistic captain - made and still makes a shocking impression.
  5). Yes, there's a far amount of seafaring jargon, but as unintelligible as it may be, it contributes to the atmosphere.
Don't read an abridged version. It isn't that tough
