Mark Levin makes some really good points on how the Supreme Court has "dictated social policy" and "legislated from the bench".  The Constitution has defined a limited role for the Federal Judiciary, yet it has supplanted the powers of the Executive and Legislative branches by reviewing Constitutional cases based on their desired partisan outcome rather than what the Constitution actually states.  This book is a must read for anyone that believes in the preservation of the United States Constitution!
