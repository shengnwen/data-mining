I enjoyed the author's style and found several useful tips on improving my presentations. Given the accepted wisdom that an audience learns more from a speaker's visual presentation then his/her verbal presentation, his advice concerning acting out a presentation was very helpful.
I have a complaint about the quality of the book itself. After I had been reading the book off and on for about a week, the book's binding gave out and chucks of the book began falling off the binding
