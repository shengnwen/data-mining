He wears a mysterious ivory charm in the shape of an elephant that is supposed to protect the wearer from harm. He gives it to  Nancy. She will surely need protection soon after, because she must  investigate a mysterious hideout and missing jewels. Could it be that the  mystery of the room in the cave and the shady circus are related? read to  find out! I would also recommed buying the applewood books fascimle edition  of this story. It is priced higher but it is the original story from the  30's. Buy both versions for some flavor and to see how the story was  changed
