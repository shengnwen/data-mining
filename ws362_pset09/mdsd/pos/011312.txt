This is an excellent audiobook covering all aspects of better speech and overall communication.  Carol Fleming helps you add vitality to your voice, speak using your natural pitch, avoid whininess and raspiness, avoid using &quot;filler&quot; words and overused superlatives, and a lot more.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in changing some aspect of his/her voice
