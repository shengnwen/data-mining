 I vaguely remembered the Grimm fairy tale that this story is based on when I borrowed this book from a friend. This story is so much better than any short fairy tale. This story goes inside our heroine's head and gives of all the reasons the events unfold the way they do. More importantly the length and prose of the novel make this story very real and not so much of a fairy tale at all.
 I was excited to learn that Hale has continued with her land and characters Bayern and will be reading them as soon as I can get my hands on them
