Mr. Parkes provides us with a comprehensive view that does true justice to 'mouths that read' and 'ears that speak' without losing sight of the import of 'the author.' Out of all of the 'Nietzsche's' out there, this is one, seeming following in Lampert's footsteps, that truly brings Nietzsche's corps/e to life.   A true find and a passionate, entertaining read for anyone trying to hear aright. Its density and attention to detail brings out the complexity of many of 'Nietzsche's' themes while weaving the many interconnected branches together around the complicated issue of 'composing the soul'. The brilliance of the approach, however, was that Parks allowed 'Nietzsche' to speak and, in my view, did not reduce 'Nietzsche' into a 'psychologist' but rather allowed 'Nietzsche' to be. Nor did he reduce the 'composition of the soul' into crass individualism best representing the 'last man.' A true example of how books should be composed, and out of the plethora of books on Nietzsche I have scanned over the years this may be the best I have read.  A book that engages both the new and old traveler embarking on the dangerous sea of "Nietzsche"
