This book was very inspiring, and informative on many matters in the life of teens. I thought this book was great and not only had fun reading it, but I also learned from it. I learned mistakes of other people, and many great lessons of life. While some stories were sad, others were cute, and happy. There are a wide variety of different stories that all contribute to the overall greatness of the book
