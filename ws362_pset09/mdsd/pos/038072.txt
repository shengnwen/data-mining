'The Thirty-Nine Steps' would probably have faded into obscurity if it was for the success of Alfred Hitchcock's film adaptation.  It is a very short novel, barely a hundred pages.  Not enough space to beef up the prose or the characterizations.  John Buchan is clearly more of a storyteller than a writer.  But in 'The Thirty-Nine Steps' he does spin a nice little story.

The story is set in Britain just before the first WW I broke out.  A bachelor in London is confronted by a man 'with a secret', one involving spies and nationality security.  When the man is found murdered our bachelor is wrongfully suspected.  He flees to both escape the law and carry forward with the murdered man's mission, again involving national security.  The story takes us from Scotland to the English south coast.  Lots of uncanny coincidences make this story wholely unbelievable.  Yet I found myself reading through this near manic-paced story with great interest ... and almost childish enjoyment.

So this is an over-the-top story told with delicious urgency and zest.  Fans of Ian Fleming (..James Bond novels) will find 'The Thirty-Nine Steps' to be dated, tame (no sex, little violence), but otherwise enjoyable
