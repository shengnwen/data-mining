Being owned by a couple of sled dogs myself and utterly familiar with their character(s), I was able to fully empathize with the author. This book is very well written, and I admired the author's candor when describing the rookie mistakes he made in the beginning of his adventure. Training sled dogs is a tough job in itself, now try doing it in a very harsh, demanding environment without all the comforts of (most people's) home. 
But the book not only focuses on the dogs, it also paints a very colorful picture of the people who live in Alaska's towns and in the wilderness. Hats off to those individuals who make it in an environment that can turn from stunningly picturesque to life-threatening within an instant!

If you love adventure travel books, and happen to like dogs, too, this is the book for you
