This book is an extremely interesting historical account of the mystique of blonde hair throughout the centuries.  It is a fascinating read, delving into societal trends surrounding beauty.  While some people may become offended they should re-evaluate what the book is really trying to say.  This is not pro-blonde propaganda, but rather an historical account of the appealing and entrancing nature of the blonde.  Yes brown hair is natural and can be mysterious there has always been a power and allure that blonde holds that brown hair, or red, can never match.  The book is an objective look at the power in beauty, specifically that of blonde hair and the associations that people have come to attach to the color.  I also found it extremely interesting the section where the author talks about the 'dumb blonde' stereotype and how that is a device used by men, and threatened brunettes, to debase and devalue the power of women.  Thoroughly a good read, well worth the time
