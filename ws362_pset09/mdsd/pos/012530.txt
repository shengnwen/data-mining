Theodore Sizer has cranked out a cottage industry's worth of books all focused on illuminating the absurdity of the current school system and offering a well-reasoned model for redesigning those schools to achieve the  purposes for which they are funded.  He is the voice of the &quot;Coalition  of Essential Schools&quot;  model for reform.  Each book uses a fictitious  &quot;Horace&quot; for dramatic dialogue, following &quot;Horace's  Compromise&quot; which communicated Sizer's research findings in 1982.  His  very readable style, primarily narrative rich with anecdotes of the many  schools he personally visited, established him as a popular and credible  author.  You don't have to have a graduate degree in education to  understand him or to feel as if you, too, could be instrumental in change  after you have red his books.  One innovation I like is the inclusion of  literature in the arts--a clear challenge to the College Board's  traditional division of disciplines, and the plea to liberate schools from  curriculum a mile wide and an inch deep:  &quot;less is more&quot;.  A good  companion author is John Goodlad
