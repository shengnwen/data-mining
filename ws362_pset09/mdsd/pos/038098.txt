I searched and searched for a good travelers guide to Wales. this is the best I found. I did utilize the wales visitors bureau for more options in accomodations, but if your doing a driving tour of Wales, this book is perfectly set up for that. It hits every little highway and biway, town by town, region by region.
We are planning our itinerary by it
