By far the best golf instruction book I've ever read, and books read, studied, and practiced include, in this order, Hogan's Five Lessons, Jim Flick's book, Manuel De La Torres's book, Ernest Jones's Swing the Clubhead, and finally Percy Boomer's book.  Hogan's book messed me up with too much emphasis on mechanics (WAY too many swing thoughts).  Flick, De La Torres, and Ernest Jones are feel teachers, and their emphasis on feeling the clubhead helped my game (by making my swing more smooth/fluid), but the problem is that it's difficult to "feel the clubhead" when it's on the end of a steel shaft instead of a string (especially with metal woods). Just could not build a repeatable, reliable swing using the "tail wags the dog" approach (i.e. feel the clubhead and let the body react).

Boomer's approach is also about feel, but unlike Flick, De La Torres, and Jones, he says the "dog wags the tail" (make your swing with muscles from the waist down, "turning in a barrel").  Boomer says the only active muscles are from the waist down, and that your arms, hands, and shoulders react naturally (and passively) in response to turning in the barrel using the muscles below the waist.  The end result is that you end up with a fluid swing that's very easy to repeat, as well as an in to out downswing (which allows you to avoid coming over the top).    

Since reading Boomer just over ONE MONTH AGO, my scores have dropped an average of about 8 strokes (from 20 handicap to around a 12) -- I think I'm going to end up with a handicap somewhere in the mid to high single digits.  Can't recommend Boomer enough
