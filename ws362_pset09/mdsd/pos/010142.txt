Former CIA agent Don Huff is in Seville, Spain writing a book about Sturmbahnfuher Skorzeny, an intimate member of Hitler's circle.  One day when his housekeeper enters the house, she sees him shot to death.  When lawyer Lang Reilly was asked by Ron's daughter to come to Spain to see if he can find any clues since the police aren't doing anything, he agrees because the deceased was his friend.

Lang and his lover Gurt who is a CIA agent on leave find out that all traces of his work on the hard drive are missing and the discs are missing.  After asking lots of questions he notices they are being followed.  When they return to the states Lang is shot and his car is blown up.  Someone wants to make sure he and Gurt don't discover something that was in the manuscript, but if they want to stay alive that is something they must do.  They travel across Europe, followed by assassins who keep trying to kill them and end up in Vatican City where secrets from the third century, World War II, and the present are revealed.

THE JULIAN SECRET is a riveting and exciting thriller that captures reader interest from the first page and keeps it throughout the entire book.  Fans of Dan Brown will find this book just as riveting as the Da Vinci Code.  Gregg Loomis is a talented storyteller who excels at creating characters that are heroic in an Indiana Jones sort of way.  The protagonist performs tremendous feats so the audience feels he is an extraordinary person called to perform measures that would defeat a lesser person.
