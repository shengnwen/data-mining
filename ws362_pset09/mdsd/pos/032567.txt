No surprises here - this is an excellent book.

The subject matter is the essence of innovation (at least in the Western world), as long as it is not for the sake of innovation but for the purposes of commercialization. Concepts like leadership vs. followership, disruptive technologies, S-curves and value networks, set a framework for complex analysis of entire industries.

Much of the discussion is fairly straightforward: the need to match resource allocation to the nature of the innovations, and the gap created by the rates of change of technology and its needs, for instance. When coupled with powerful concepts like the reasons behind organizations' failure to attend to disruptive innovations, and the fallacies loyalty to customers bring, the pages read like a treatise on what make some companies great or lousy innovators.

The only criticism I could draw is some repetiveness - but I would not hold that against the author: the underlying themes are too closely interconnected
