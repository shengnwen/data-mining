This book is funny. No one can doubt that. The reader can truely feel the joy, the sadness, the hope, the loss, the success and the failure that Bridget Jones feels from page to page. The movie is, indeed, hilarious, and to some extent better than the book. Do not expect flowery writing styles like that of Maya Angelou. Expect a more simplified style, such as that of Meg Cabbot (although more 'adult,' as it were, intelligent and thought/emotion-provoking) Expect a good page-turner, which keeps you rooting for the character to find the perfect sex-God who will love all fluxuating 131 lbs of her and keep her mother quiet all at the same time. Most greatly, however, you wish nothing less than for her to be happy with the Bridget Jones that you will grow to love. Most certainly reccomend. Good summer- or plane-ride-rea
