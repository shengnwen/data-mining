As someone who spent most of the 1990s in junior high and high school, this book was a fascinating entree into the "irrational exhuberance" of the 1990s dot.com era, when any business remotely related to the internet could go public for millions (if not billions) of dollars, even with steady losses and without a solid business plan.  It was amazing to me to read about the number of investors who would buy stock in companies that hadn't proven anything, but simply had a website and believed they could tap into a certain percentage of an already- existing market.  This book gives you an understanding of how AOL, a brand new company with much lower annual profits, could essentially acquire Time Warner, a larger company that had shown the test of time.  More than that, the book shows you how investors - in fact, all of America - were overtaken by greed, irrationality, and a pack mentality that was ultimately detrimental.  I wasn't mature enough during the 90s to really understand what was going on, and so I'm glad I read this book
