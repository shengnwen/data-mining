Mahfouz's Cairo Trilogy is an absolute classic. With an unrivaled literary style, Mahfouz succeeds in bringing human life with all its complexity in simple, and unphilosophical terms. Mahfouz has a take on human nature, but what distinguishes him from others is that it's through the words and actions of the characters in his novel that we are able to see this profound knowledge of human nature, and not through the use of heavy symbolism. Mahfouz, in his Cairo Trilogy expresses a deep philosophy of life, captured in Egyptian society, in simple and intriguing writing. 

In short, the Cairo Trilogy is a philosophical page-turner
