This book is very thorough, and although it seems a bit alarmist, it's apparent that the information he covers could really become necessary in terms of a major disaster. My primary criticism is the in the editing. The author continually uses the word "loose" when he means "lose," for example, and it's an error that's found throughout the book. It makes me cringe when I see it, but when you get past things like that the information is valuable and it's well presented.

Whether you're an all-out build-a-bomb-shelter in your backyard type, or just someone who wants to be prepared for a weeklong power outage in the winter, this book has you covered
