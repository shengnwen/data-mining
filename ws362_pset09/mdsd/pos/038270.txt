This book tells the real story behind Anne Heche's life and is incredibly compelling. Anne Heche is the movie star best known for dating Ellen DeGeneris for a while and then going "crazy" (i.e., having a psychotic break). At the height of her craziness, she was found one day wandering near a dirt road in Fresno waiting for a space ship to take her to heaven. But behind the madness is a story to explain it all. Heche survived god awful abuse as a child. All the crazy things in her life that happened subsequently make perfect sense in light of her past. For example, her Jesus complex stemmed from the fact that her mother devoted herself entirely to Jesus rather than to her family. (In one telling instance, Anne asked her mother what her mother's purpose in life was, and the mother responded "to serve Jesus and get to heaven," not to love her family or even to love herself. By "becoming" Jesus, Anne tried to finally earn her mother's love and approval.) The book demonstrates well that madness has a psychic basis and that recovery is possible. Plus, it's very readable and engaging. I really enjoyed it.
