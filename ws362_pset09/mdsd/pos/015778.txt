I started using this log book and everything made total sense. It was easy to use and very helpful. However, I received Bodylink from Timex as a gift which basically replaced this book.
If you have about $300 to spend get the Bodylink system with heart rate monitor, data logger and GPS+speed+distance and you would have everything you need
