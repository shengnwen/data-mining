This book may be out of print but it's definitely worth finding and reading.

A driving, devastating indictment of the greedy "televangelists" who reached the peak of their financial powers in the 1980's and then saw it taken away from them in a series of humiliating scandals that made people question their faith...in TV preachers anyway.
I remember chatting with a book store clerk at that time and learning she was a born-again Christian.  Shaking her head at the Bakker/Swaggart/Roberts scandals, she said, "The devil really won that round."
"How do you know it was the devil that brought them down?" I asked. "I have the impression that maybe God had had about enough of their shenaningans."
But that's about the extent of my stone-throwing.  I end up feeling pity for these people.  And feeling horrible for the millions who poured their millions into these lavish lifestyles.  My great grandmother could have been referred to as one of Bakker's "Granny Grunts," the elderly ladies he always beseeched to fess up with the cash.  
I could see through Bakker even as a kid and felt sorry that my great grandma couldn't.  If anything, I think the PTL scandal made her realize where her real devotion should have been: on the savior mentioned in every PTL sales pitch, not the bawling, over-dressed con artists pleading for dollars for that big water slide in their amusement park.

Charles Shepard, the author and reporter for the Charlotte Observer, was the perfect person to write this book: he'd been covering Bakker for years and seeing scams and abuses up close for a long time.
Definitely worth your while to read.
