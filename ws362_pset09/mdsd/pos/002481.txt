I think this book is great and it has some of the most interesting stories  I've read about modern feminism to date. There is a wide variety of essays  ranging from militant feminism to black feminism to male feminism to a  supermodel's opinions on being feminist. The only gripe I would have about  this book is the fact that several of the articles seemed to escape the  issue of feminism and dwell entirely on racial and anti-white issues.  Overall though, the context of the well-written essays far outweighed the  poorly-written ones
