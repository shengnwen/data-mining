Without a doubt this is Zig's best book. It contains principals from all his books and an insight into the way Zig has lived a successful, "Better Than Good" life. Whether you are looking for direction, calling, or just a good motivator this book does it all and I highly recommend every single person read it. You will not be disappointed! An amazing book I plan on reading once a year
