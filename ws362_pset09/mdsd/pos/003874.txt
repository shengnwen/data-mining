This book was so powerful, that I found myself in class longing to know what was going to happen next.  Of course I couldn't just pull out the book in front of my professor and read it, but whenever I got a break I was reliving the past of "Winnie"

This book starts off in the point of view of Pearl, who is Winnie's daughter.  Peal's Aunt Helen (Winnie's "sister") is someone I came to really dislike in the book.  She told Winnie that if Winnie didn't tell Pearl her secrets that she would.  And that's when the story changes.

So now, we're seeing Winnie telling Pearl the true story of her life and all the horrible things she had to endure.  It is such a beautiful story that takes place during WWII.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves to hear stories of the past and why people are the way they are now
