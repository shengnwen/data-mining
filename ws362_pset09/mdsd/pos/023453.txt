I bought the book after reading Friedman's "The World is Flat". I am still struggling to find consistent answers related to global economy.
Now, the book is a must read therefore I give it 4 stars so people will buy it. 
However, it shold be mandatory for everyone to compare those statements with the actual WTO agreements and the GATT (freely available at http://www.wto.org).
I treasured the book's articles good points, although I sensed some extreme takes. I do not like the ruthless, deregulated, trade ueber alles oriented world we are currently living in. Yet, statements like there is no mention of environmental issues are quite unfair. The very first lines of the WTO agreement include: "...seeking both to protect and preserve the environment and to enhance the means for doing so in a manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development...". That means to me that the intentions are in place; if somebody (corporations-controlled-governments) is actually amending those basic rules, then those entities are to be blamed. 
And you will find many points of such reflections if you actually give the other side a chance.
Said that, I think that something still smells fishy (I jsut noticed that Saudi Arabia wasn't part of the deal until 2 weeks ago, what's up with that).
Be intellectually democratic and do yourself the favor of indulging the pleasure of this text along with some critical analysis
