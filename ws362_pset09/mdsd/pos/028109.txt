The book condition would have been 5 stars had it not had the name of the person in large letters on the top and bottom of the books pages (when the book is closed) Also it was sent in a thin layer of white paper which made it amazing that it was in as good of condition as it was...cause the wrapping had gotten shredded in several places leaving the book vulnerable to being damaged. I would suggest using something heavier for wrapping next time to protect the book better.
