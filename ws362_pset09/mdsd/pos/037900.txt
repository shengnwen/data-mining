I am amazed at the sort of complex storytelling that Ms. Minarik can accomplish with fairly simple words.  [Why can't more modern authors accomplish the same?!?]

In this book, Little Bear finds two new friends, a little girl named Emily and her doll, Lucy.  Together they have adventures which include going to a party, a broken arm for Lucy, and tragedy of tragedies... Emily's having to go away at the end of summer to attend school.

Five Stars.  Wonderful storytelling.  Good Read-aloud.  I would estimate that this "I Can Read" book is on the first grade level.  [Other sources list it as a second grade reader: 2.2  Level.]

Principally the difficulty lies not in the vocabulary but in the fact that there is quite a bit of dialog and more words per page than is found in Ms. Minarik's earlier stories.
