If Melville had decided to channel the spirits of the Marquis de Sade and Elizabeth Bathory and then set out to write the great American western (only after devouring half a sheet of blotter acid), the results might be something along the lines of this epic. Tarantino and Scorsese wish they were this capable of depicting the human animal's capacity for bloodlust, delerium and psychosis. Friends, this book is damn raw and damn gorgeous. The intensity inches up the whole ride. Moreover, this one is home to one of the most insanely vicious hombres to grace the pages of the novel: 

The Judge. I couldn't put this baby down when I first read it. Read it 5 times since. Trust me. This one stays with you.
