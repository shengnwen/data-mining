Don't let the name fool you, this is not a farm animal book in any aspect. This is a legend, really! I first read this book in middle school, while all the other kids were reading Goosebump-like books I was delving into this funny, bold and often sad treasure. 
Lorraine and John, two sophomores in high school, draw you into this seemingly average teen novel about the angst of being young bored and desperately hating school. And then they meet Mr. Pignati (The Pigman) and their once boring lives take some wild turns. They smoke, they curse, they drink and party but still yet Mr. Zindel pulls out a great lesson at the end. Wonderfully, truthfully, authentically written for anyone to enjoy. 
I'm 24 now and I have a copy still and encourage anyone to pick one up as well and give it a few pages, trust me you won't put it down until your done
