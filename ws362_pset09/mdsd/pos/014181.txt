I enjoyed Deloria's style and humor.  He explains a cultural Native American perspective on the long debated hypothesis of evolution (not a theory until it's been proven - as long as there is this much arguement, it can't be proven.  Nor will it be as long as no one remembers how it started).  He doesn't give the answers, just his research using another view...a view I think could be valuable if considered by scholars. Knowing how scholars try to conceptualize the world in their knowledge, they tend to leave out or discount information if it doesn't fit into their premise. I think Deloria is trying to elicit an evaluation of those restrictions through his writing
