Catherine Simone's emotional chronicle about her experience with interstitial cystitis is a must read for anyone suffering with this sometimes debilatating condition.  It has been my experience as well that some traditional doctors with their traditional methods can often do more harm than good.  Read this book and find out how Catherine took control of her own health with great success.  Be sure to also read her follow up "how to" book, "Along the Healing Path," which continues to give the IC patient a sense of hope and empowerment
