This book is a really good run down of gay history leading up to the gay marriage issue of today. It is concise, easy to read and a great history lesson for those not too familiar with gay history.  I would definitely recommend it for those who are not too familiar with the issues surrounding the gay marriage issue-and leading up to it.
