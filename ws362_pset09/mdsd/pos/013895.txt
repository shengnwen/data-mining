Philip K. Dick's work has to be taken as a body. All of it encompasses what I call his "ironic paranoia." "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" fits right into this.

The problems with Dick's films are two. They are either (1) too philosophical or (2)  action films. Or they are both. What they have not been is ironical. And without irony, you haven't got Dick.

"Minority Report," "Blade Runner," and even "Screamers" were enjoyable films. But they all lacked Dick's wit. Only "Total Recall" came close, with its unexpected twists feeding on paranoia, though the overall result was more burlesque than satire.

Stick with "Androids" and the other novels and short stories, especially the earlier ones (through 1965). Taken as a body of work, they are monumental
