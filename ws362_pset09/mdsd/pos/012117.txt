Craig Nelson's book is a beautifully written account of the life of Thomas Paine. It is the first biography I've read about the man so am unable to judge it against others, but am quite certain that anyone, familiar with Paine and the revolutionary era or not, would enjoy this story of the life of an American and inevitably World hero. 

Through this tale of revolution, struggle, and the rise and decline in the public eye, Nelson's Thomas Paine: Enlightenment, Revolutions, and the Birth of Modern Nations will reveal some of the more subtle, usually unspoken physical, political, and financial costs that were endured by a man that strove to give freedom to the world. However, conveying this personal struggle only provides an even more inspirational picture of the revolutionary. Nelson's book will demonstrate how Paine, by presenting us through the tip of a pen with the then radical, progressive ideas of liberty that would soon drastically alter the nature of human civilization, broke down the barriers of oppression that stood in the way of the enlightenments greatest philosophical revelation: Democracy. However, in doing so, the story of Thomas Paine's life will reveal a barrier still in place today, unbroken, which impeded and continues to restrict the climax of that 18th century ideal. But for attempting to bring it down as well, being the 200 years-ahead-of his time revolutionary he was, lived his last 10 years hated, forgotten, and unwanted. And until recently, has remained so.

"When men yield up the privilege of thinking, the last shadow of liberty quits the horizon." ~Thomas Paine
