All women have their problems, but for Bridget Jones, with her seemingly permanent single life, for which all of her married acquaintances obsessively harass her about, her habit of drinking a little too much, and her trouble with her weight, which seems to mysteriously rocket up and down, the poor thing just can't seem to catch a break.
 
An instantly lovable character, Bridget is real, and her complaints about life and men are often hilarious and believable. Her conversations with her friends are also extremely enjoyable as they dish and grumble about all the things that men do wrong, which, you know, are quite a lot. Often her musings and thoughts, the "What's wrong with me," and her compulsively-fixated dieting and attempts at positive reinforcement, are very entertaining.
  
Very funny book that is different in several ways from the movie; so if you have seen the movie, try the book (books).
