In the severe winter of 1139, the civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud is still in progress with refugees fleeing from the sacked city of Worcester, and marauding bands of robbers taking advantage of the situation and preying on the weak. At Bromfield Abbey, 20 miles from the Shrewsbury Abbey home of Brother Cadfael, a visitng monk has been savagely beaten and left for dead. As his condition worsened, the Abbot sends for Cadfael with his greater knowledge of defence wounds and their treatment. Deputy Sherriff Hugh Beringar has also been informed that the two teenaged children of a nobleman are missing, en route to the safety of the Abbey, accompanied by a young nun. After listening to the feverish ravings of the sick monk, Cadfael searches for and finds the body of the nun, frozen in a pond. Hugh and his men hack the block of ice containing the body, free and upon the ice thawing, Cadfael finds that the nun has been savagely raped and smothered. The young missing travellers are found and, in his methodical fashion,Cadfael, with his knowledge of affairs of the heart and awareness of human failings, helps to unravel several mysteries which beset the teenagers, as well as unravellling a mystery of his own former life as a crusader. It's a simple read of an age in which violence is no stranger to everyday life, and where the powerful hold sway over the lives of the ordinary people
