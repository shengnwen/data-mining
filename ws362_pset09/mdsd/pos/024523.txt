The fact that Junior Cain is a Psychopath and unofficial disciple of some crackpot "psychologist" is incidental. The fact that young Barty is a rare prodigy is also incidental. The foundation of this story to me, was the endurance of faith and hope in the face of tragedy. It was about random acts of kindness, family and fellowship, as well as treating every stranger as a friend. I found this book to be very moving and uplifting.
