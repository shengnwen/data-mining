Actually, I am in the process of listening to this book on tape and am getting a really good vibe from the actual author as she reads.  She definately says "take what you can and leave the rest behind.  Unfortunately, conservative Christians come off as "holier than thou" and bascially to me their concepts of the Bible detaches from everyday life.  What good is a religion in my opinion if it doesn't teach you how to be a better human being.  As far as the Bible goes, there has been edits made by those in position to do so to disempower the people for their own selfish means.  Sylvia goes into this in speaking of reincarnation as an example of the corruptness of religious authoritarians.  Remember slavery was deem appropriate by so called Christians at one time.  However, Christianity isn't the disease, but those who interpret and misuse its teachings are the culprit of evil and that goes for any religious belief.     I believe we have so much to learn about ourselves, life, the afterlife and the basic truth of all existence and to think there is only one way of thinking hinders us as human beings and our awarness of the eternity of life.  When our beliefs limits our thinking or actions how great is that, I ask?  I say stop preaching damnation and the wrath of God, and show by example the power of what it means to truly human and to love your fellow person
