This is an excellent book about Greek hoplite warfare. It shows the reality of Ancient Greek wars and warriors. It explains that the hoplites were not young and muscular like most people believe. It also show the brutality of Greek warfare and how much it changed over time. The illustrations and maps complent the well written text. My only complaint is what does the author have against Alexander the Great? He compares him to Hitler and I don't understand why. I guess he needs to realize like most readers of military history already does is that thoughts and attitudes about what is considered barbaric and what is considered just a way of life changes from time to time and place to place. What Alexander did really was not considered that brutal in his time. Look at what the Romans did on the battlefield and at home. The reason Hitler is considered barbaric and sick, which he was, is his reasons for killing were absurd and the amount of people he killed for those reasons woulld make any human being in that time and our time sick to their stomach. To truly understand what the reasons why some of the stuff that happened in wars happened is to understand how the people of the time lived and thought
