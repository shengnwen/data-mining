There aren't too many good D-SLR guidebooks out there -- and most of them appear to be written by this author.  I checked out his "Quick Snap Guide to D-SLRs" and it was very good, but too basic for me.  The same could be said for Busch's "Digital SLR Cameras and Photography for Dummies" although it did go into more detail.  This book was just right, with lots of in-depth material about using digital SLRs, as well as tips and techniques I could apply right away.  This author also has more advanced books on D-SLRs, and I will probably check them out after I've had a chance to learn everything in this book
