  I recommended The book named "Laura Ingalls: Abiography" written by William Anderson.  I have three reasons I recommended.
  First I feel that Laura has good personality.  I learn a lot of things from this character. So it will be helpful for our life to be a good person.   
  Second, this story is a family story and is also a success story.  And then this story will make us feel happy.  
  Third this book is it is easy to read.  To read easier might be possible to try reading other book and image many things about this book. So it is good for us who need reading skill.
  That is all I recommended it.
