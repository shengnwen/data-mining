Most books that I have read on Eleanor Roosevelt stress that no matter how revolutionary she might have seemed, she lived her life within certain bounds for her time.  Yet this book demonstrates that the historical  character and the real woman are very different. The author portrays  Eleanor as a woman who did not find herself until her mid-thirties and then  was determined to live as she wanted.  Her marriage to Franklin was not  fulfilling and she needed more.  She found this with various life long  friends who shared her passion for politics and social change.   The author  does an excellent job staying on track, and keeping Eleanor in the  forefront.  This is definitely not a biography of Franklin!  I found the  information on the early life of Eleanor to be especially interesting, in  how so many of the obstacles that she faced as a youth played a large role  in how she dealt with others the rest of her life.  Her childhood is  hearbreaking and I can't help but think that even for all her wealth and  priviledge, how sad her childhood was.  She seemed to search all her life  to find a home and finally decided to create her own with her friends, not  her family.  Even though she had five children, their lives were controlled  by her mother-in-law, Sara Delano Roosevelt.  Rather than become depressed  at the various obstacles presented by her life, she rose above them and  ultimately became a very fulfilled and happy person
