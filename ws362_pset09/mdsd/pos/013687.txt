Thank you to Will Richardson for providing us with a book that is filled with practical information on blogs, wikis, podcasts, and other powerful tech tools. When I purchased my book, I found that I couldn't put it down.  There were ideas that I could try immediately to helped me begin my journey of implementation.  So many books only talk about theory, but this book gives you tips on what to do right now to get started on these topics.  I found the book to be refreshing and exciting, and one that I reference often.  Highly recommended
