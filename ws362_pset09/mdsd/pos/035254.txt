Hi,
I recently appeared for the CISSP exam and cleared it in the first attempt. The only book i used for the preparation was the one from Shon Harris. Dont pay heed to others who say that this should not be the only reference. After i gave the exam i was pretty sure that i am gonna clear it. That was the level of confidence that i had. I bet , if you read all the chapters thoroughly and have a crack at all the tests on the accompanying CD you are through. 
All the best

P.S: I have a little more than 3 years of experience in information security.
