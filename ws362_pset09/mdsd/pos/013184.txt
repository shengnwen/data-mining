Patrick Keane is recounting the history of his life, but as he's doing this we realize that really it's the history of his life as it pertains to Will Savage, his best friend and roommate from prep school who went on to become a huge record producer. A bit of the present is thrown into the mix, I guess to remind us that this is, in fact, history, but 95% of the book takes place in the past. At first this is a little strange and you wonder when the REAL action is going to take place, but once you realize that the back story IS the story, it's quite enjoyable.

McInerney makes his way through the 60's, 70's, and 80's, interweaving real events with fictional ones and real characters with fictional characters. It's an exciting read, and the writing style is very much in character for Patrick Keane, the narrator. At times you feel like big vocabulary words are thrown in just to impress, and when Patrick does just that in a letter to Will, it solidifies the idea that Patrick Keane, the grown-up, is the one telling the story. Patrick recounts the life of Will Savage in relation to the Savage family history, almost like a modern-day telling of the life of a prince, asserting that we do still live in times where royal families exist, and lineage does matter, when we're talking about money.

It's a great read, and definitely worth the time.

This novel is the fourth I've read by Jay McInerney (Bright Lights, Big City, Story of My Life, Ransom) and the first one that convinced me that he's actually a very talented writer. Ransom was a mediocre novel (at best), and both Bright Lights, Big City and Story of My Life were written in a meandering, almost intentionally pointless style. Last of the Savages has very well developed characters and tells an interesting story in a fairly complicated way
