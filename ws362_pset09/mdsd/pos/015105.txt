Let me begin this review by stating that I am an avid reader of Mystery novels, preferring those set in the United Kingdom.  With that in mind, I cannot emphasize enough that this first novel by Peter Robinson, as well as his subsequent novels (I have read the next four thus far) are pitch perfect.  The settings, the standard methodical investigative activity, all are spiced with suspense and intrigue.  

In the novel, former London policeman relocates to the "quaint" village of Eastvale.  However, big city crimes are not limited to big cities.  The case of a Peeping Tom and the murder of an elderly woman form the basis for a very satisfying mystery novel
