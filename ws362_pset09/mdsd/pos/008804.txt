I am in my first semester of an MBA program.  The required text for my OR/MS class (An Introduction to Management Science, 10th ed., by Anderson, Sweeney, Williams) left something to be desired.  I work with the SAS programming language, and happened to be discussing the SAS/OR product with a SAS technical support rep.  He recommended this Winston text.  I think it explains concepts much better than my Anderson text and has helped me a lot in my OR/MS class
