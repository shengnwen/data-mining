I think that this book; The Privilege of Youth, is a very good book. i dont recomend people who are depressed to read this book. it  took me 3 hours to read this book, as it did David Pelzer's other books, i have not yet read Help Yourself, but i will soon be buying it to read. i hope that people who think it is cool to abuse their children and to hurt people physicaly and mentally, read these books that David Pelzer wrote. it will give them an insite on what they are actually doing to their children. i think that it is completly sick how someone could do such horrible things to someone so young and helpless. i my self was also physicaly and verblly abused throughout my younger years and i am not even a full adult yet, i am 17 yrs old, and i still am abused. The Privilege of Youth is a good book to read. when i was reading it, i related to my self in school. when he was beat up and tortured, i didnt think about myself, but about wanting to belong and wanting to have friends that liked you for who he was, i thought of myself. i only wanted friends that liked me for me, but i never got them. Over all, i think that this book is a very good book to read. David Pelzer inspires all who read his books
