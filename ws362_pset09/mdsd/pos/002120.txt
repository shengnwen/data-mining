This thin edition, containing only a few of Kafka's short stoires, seems unlikely to cause the powerfully disturbing reactions that it brings out in its readers.  In his story &quot;The Metamorphosis,&quot; Kafka writes a tale of how a salesman turns into a bug overnight.  As unlikely as this situation sounds, Kafka succeeds in making the situation seem real by going into extreme detail about both the physical and emotional effects of the character's metamorphosis.  Although logic prevents anyone from actually believing they may turn into a bug, readers can still relate to the common emotions of the story, of being alienated and unwanted, of being a cumbersome burden unto others.  The other stories in the edition are equally engaging and disturbing in their realistic, sometimes frightful descriptions
