This is the best barbecue cookbook that I have ever read, and I've read more than a few.  It's extremely informative and easy to read.  You not only come away with great recipes and techniques but the knowledge to make your own recipes (marinades, dry rubs, etc.).  If you want to become a man or woman who knows what to do in the backyard in the summer then you need to get this book
