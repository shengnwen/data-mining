I read the book and then I saw the musical.  I can't deside which one I like better, it's really a toss up.  The book is much more political, with an almost rambling feel toward the end.  The musical deletes all that, but then it arrives at its conclusion a little too neatly; with everything tied up in a pretty bow.  Read the book yourself.  It is VERY clever and very ironic, which I love.  Like I said, more political than I'd prefer.
