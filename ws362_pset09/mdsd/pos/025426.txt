Essentially everybody is having the kind of time that the Cary Grant character has in the movie &quot;Bringing Up Baby,&quot; and it's all happening at the same time, and all tightly interrelated, yet it's not at  all confusing. Somehow through all the silliness, real feelings are  expressed and real &quot;philosophies of life&quot; interact. It's very  funny and very clever
