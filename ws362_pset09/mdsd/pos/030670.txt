Shirley Neitzel wrote a book called The Jacket I Wear In The Snow.  The main character of the story is a little boy who tells a story.  This story takes place at the little boy's house and it is in the winter.  The book talks about the little boy and all the clothes that he has to wear outside.  This book is different because it talks about clothes and replaces words with pictures of clothes, and it is in poem form.  I think that the story is funny because it rhymes a lot.  The illustrations are just like normal clothes, with a very nice tint drawn in with colored pencils.  Overall, I really liked this story because it represents little kids and how they have to wear a lot of clothes outside, and that they cry sometimes when they get cold
