Theres no way to learn everything about the Central Nervous System in an easier way than with this book.Its even got a separate Clinical section for every chapter!! I really enjoyed reading this book, along with  Adam's Neurology(another great one).

The only con is that its got a couple of mistakes(maybe not serious) for example when you get to the part describing the Direct and Indirect Talamus-Striatal Pathways and a couple more
