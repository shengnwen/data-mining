This is not a statistics Text book, but a history of how the "science" of Statistics came about, it focuses mostly on the players, not so much the music, and as such it works extremely well. In my mind the most important topic covered is the discussion of the possible evolution of statistics. It is a sad fact that most people focus on what they know and the strengths of that knowledge, not what they don't know and the weakness that this creates. This is true not only of the lay person but the professional also. It think that is essential to understand the history of the how and why we got where we are if we are to fully appreciate what we are doing, This volume, although no exhaustive, does a high highly commendable job in this respect. Recommended for lay person and statistician alike, but particularly to those statisticians who can't shut their egos down long enough to realize that all we know are simply propositions that have not yet been falsified.
