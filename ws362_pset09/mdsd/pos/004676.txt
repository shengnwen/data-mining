     When I first started reading this book I thought that it was boring and I felt like I could fall asleep, but then it started turning out to be really interesting and enjoyable.
	In this novel, war hasn't started yet but it soon does, after. This book has many different characters but the subject is all the same. Some of the characters were sometimes convincing, but sometimes the story got boring because at times they just talked aboutwhat there children did or what the characters were worrying about, like war. I really liked the way that Lily Malloy would describe things such as, mother wailed or other type of describing words she used. The book was really interesting here and there. 
	Northerners and Southerners were talked a lot about in this book. Pretty much all the  characters were either from some state in the South or from some state in the North. The theme to this book was war. This book really isn't my kind of reading because I like books that have a little bit of love or romance in them, but I sort of liked this novel. I can relate to this book with my friend Ann, because in this book Shem Suggs loves horses and so does my friend Ann. I don't like books that talk about historical facts or anything like that. I guess in school that's what you would read, books like that. 
	Bull Run was a Newbery Award-winning book, which the author wrote. I feel that if your are an adventurish person you'll enjoy this book. This book, kind of left me hanging, becuase of the end . I'm not going to ruin the end of the book for you though! Read the book and then you'll find out how I felt. Very touched and agervated at times. It made me feel like I was hanging on to the edge of my chair.
