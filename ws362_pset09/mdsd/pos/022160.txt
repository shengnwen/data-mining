Fantasies of RAH? The title made me envision Heinlein surrounded by redheaded, brilliant, multi-lingual women, somewhere on the Moon. But it's actually a collection of this brilliant but warped author's non-science  fiction works, and a great collection it is, too. Of COURSE it's repackaged  from old stories, because RAH, being dead, hasn't written much lately. PC  revisionists have tried to drive Heinlein into critical disfavor by  pointing to his obsession with and peculiar treatment of women without  taking into consideration that he was working in the early fifties, and  that his later work attempted to make amends. But don't listen to them, or  me: read this seminal work and see for yourself. He was the Dean of SF; he  opened the doors for the rest, and his work will live forever. Wait and  see
