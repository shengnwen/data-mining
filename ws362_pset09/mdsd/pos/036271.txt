The CD version was well read and the reader was able to keep my attention during a grueling bus ride.

The story of The Johnstown Flood of 1889 was a well researched book that explained how the lack of money spent to AVOID a disaster was the actual cause of one of the worst disasters in American history.  The story is very similar in nature to the disaster in New Orleans. However, this damn was built primarily to develop a lake in order to apease the appetites of a few very wealthy men who wanted a "getaway in the mountains."  Despite repeated warnings of possible disaster if and when the damn would break, the exclusive executive club refused to spend money for needed repairs. The result was a horrible flood following an ususally heavy rainstorm that killed over 2,000 innocent people in the valley below, leaving thousands homeless, jobless and badly injured.  Schools and libraries were distroyed along with businesses.  

The story weaves in and out of the facts that were reported by newspapers, found in record books, and stories passed down through the generations. Similar in nature as in today's world, Johnstown was flooded with reporters, people wanting to help, supplies and food, etc.  Of interest is the fact that this was the very first real disaster that the newly formed RED CROSS has attented.  McCullough points out from records how many very poor families throughout the US sent what they could while the weathly members of the club that caused the flood gave almost nothing, nor were they ever held accountable fore the disaster.     

This book is a documentary, and thus rather dry at times.  However, the author did an excellent job of pulling facts together, and wrote it in such a way as to keep you interested throughout.

I definately recommend this book, and feel the person reading for the CD copy did a fine job.
