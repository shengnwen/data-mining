    I have to admit that I would never have picked up the book if I hadn't seen the cover with the barcode on the back of the neck of the person with the shaved head.  Sometimes a cover can really help sell a book!  
     I loved this book despite its minor flaws.  It did leave me with a number of questions and one is left to their own conclusions as to how it will all play out after the final page has been read, but for those who love a read that makes you think, this is for you.  
    As a prior reviewer comments, it really does remind me of linguistic feats of The Crying Of Lot 47 by Pynchon or even his Gravity's Rainbow.  It is not an easy read and much is left out but it is very rewarding
