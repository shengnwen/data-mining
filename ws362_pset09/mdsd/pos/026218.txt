The Undercover Economist's aim "is to help you see the world through the eyes of an economist."  The book builds momentum early on delving into concepts such as: 

 1. scarcity power - farmers vs. landowners, or coffee shops on busy streets vs. coffee drinkers running late to work
 2. "the world of truth" - trying to by a "lemon" vs. a "peach" at the used car lot, when you know nothing and the dealer knows everything
 3. externalities - pollution or traffic -- things that cannot be negotiated between two or more parties without some top-level planning
 4. game theory - Von Neumann's desire to understand the game of poker, which ultimately lead to his and Oskar Morgenstern's work, "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior," which essentially created game theory!

The book does a good job of highlighting both the successes and failures of economic theory when in practice.  Proving that understanding economic theory is no silver bullet, and that you still need common sense to craft good policies.  And often, suggestions are made which require top-down policy making, such as taxing traffic to eliminate conjestion with no clear method how to get there.  Perhaps, this is an exercise left to the reader. :)

Harford's skill throughout the book is at diving deep into familiar issues and exposing the larger economic forces which drive them using simple yet effective English, no formulas or esoterica.   Harford's ability at continually weaving the perfect metaphor or example with the thread of economic theory is seamless.  To this end, this book is a great success. However, when the book, coming to its end, attempts to uncover globalization, the theme quickly falls apart and exposes the author's own biases.  To be fair, Harford admits both that the topic of globalization demands its own book, and that he is heavily biased in favor of free trade.  However, he grapples with the difficult topic anyway and has mixed results.
