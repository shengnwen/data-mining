These five stories are all worth reading. &quot;Entropy&quot; is no doubt his most famous; first anthologized in BASS and, since then, numerous other places (even Norton anthologized it in American Literature). Pynchon writes  in his elucidating intro. that this story is something like the epitome of  every flaw of a young writer; but, man, he also realizes that this is his  most famous short story (i.e., take his intro. with a grain of salt  [whatever that cliche really means]). &quot;The Secret Integration&quot; is  a wonderfully sensitive story -- and uncharacteristically NOT overwritten.  It was fascinating to see the mind of a young, Cornell Pynchon at work and  I believe is an inspiration for all aspiring young writers
