I won't go into the full-on details of what this book entails, for I feel the other most capable reviewers plus the publisher's back cover copy of Mr. Cesarani's book do more than an adequate job.

I thank Mr. Cesarani for painting a most cinematic-like picture of the Eichmann takedown in the Argentine. I relished every page and line of that chapter for the simple reason that the story we already knew the outcome of was narrated in such a hair-raising and chilling style. Narrative non-fiction is truly the word of the age.

This was one of the better books I've read all year
