I'm IN LOVE with this book.  It's one of the greatest if not THE greatest story I've ever read.  Nancy Garden certainly knows a lot about the world of lesbian teenagers and homophobia.  This is the story, where I can actually relate to the characters, and the wonderful language makes me feel like one of them.  What's best about this book is that it shows the true romance, love between two girls instead of just sexual lust.  As I already mentioned, this book is Amazing (with the capital A)
