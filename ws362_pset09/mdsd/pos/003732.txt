I just finished this one. Good read and good follow up if you have read 'Donnie Brasco'. This book ties up alot of loose ends (especially w/ the murder of the three Bonnano captains). I rated this one a four because it went into detail in some areas and glossed over some others. I would like to have seen some org chart (like in Roemer's book about the Outfit) with the various caporegimes and soldati. I thought the court excerpts interwoven with the storyline was a bit distracting.
