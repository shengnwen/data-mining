I was starting to create quite a raucous in the bookstore when I picked up this little gem. Even though I paid way more than if I had ordered it online here, I just couldn't let it go. Anyone who's been through the corporate world the past 10 years will get it because you were there, you lived it, and you faced death by powerpoint on a frequent basis. The little pictures that go along with it are absolutely hysterical. [...], and the book should have included a few more current trends. Buy it if you'd like that little trip down memory lane. It's ok, you can laugh about it now
