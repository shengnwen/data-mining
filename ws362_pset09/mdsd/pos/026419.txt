I found this book to closely tie in with Dame Julian of Norwich's &quot;Revelations of Divine Love&quot;.  It has wonderful insights for each day, and helps one to understand &quot;Revelations&quot; from a different  prespective.  I started the 30 days during a family vacation at the beach  and continued on until I had read the entire booklet.  Afterwards, I had  noticed that I had just about filled my journal with insights into God and  how God relates to us.  A wonderful meditaional guide for those of us on a  journey
