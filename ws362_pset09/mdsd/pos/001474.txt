This is a truly great collection of runes, but you should contact the seller before you buy.  A great many of these sets are for sale on Amazon, but they do not come with the stones and the bag, which were originally included with the book.  Although the book makes great reading material in its way, it is virtually worthless without the stones.  Runes and Rune books always vary, and if you don't get the stones that go with the book, it doesn't do much good.  This set should come with the book, a gray bag, and the actual runestones.  I keep finding that the stones are not included in some of these sales
