I guess I'm hooked.  I read everyone of J.D. Robb's books as soon as they make their way to paperback. They are always a quality, gripping read.  No exception with this 19th installment. 

With each book the relationships of the central characters deepen.  This novel focuses on Dallas and her relationship with her longtime partner, Detective Peabody. Eve and Roarke continue to harmonize and share adventures. 

This series of books is solid, and like most mystery readers I appreciate it when the writer takes the time to grow the characters and keep the plot turns interesting.
