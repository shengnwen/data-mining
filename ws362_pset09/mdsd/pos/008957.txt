The essays on modern dance in America are particularly outstanding.  Ms. Acocella writes with passion and knowledge.  Many of her observations are succint yet sympathetic.

Her essay on Marguerite Yourcenar, the French writer who lived in Maine for much of her life, literally jumped off the page for me. No one who reads this book will be disappoited
