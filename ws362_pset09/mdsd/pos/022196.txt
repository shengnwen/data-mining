In the world of urban design, obsessed with spectacular novelty and superficial aesthetics, this ambitious and profound work of Kevin Lynch is refreshing, yet enduring.  He suggests a theory of urban design based on fundamental human values and examines how  such values lead to the notion of a &quot;good city form&quot;.  His performance dimensions (e.g. access, fit, vitality) are broad enough to be interpreted and re-interpreted for specific contexts and sites.  And the appendix, which briefly summarizes other theories of city form, is a tour-de-force by itself.  A masterpiece which deserves greater attention and consideration, especially by those under the illusion that urban design is more or less architecture writ large
