I read this book believing it would give me a neutral perspective on the 1967 Arab Israeli war I should have took more care with my choice and took note of who the author was (a BBC Journalist).

The BBC are notorious bias against the Israelis as a result this book is nothing more than another edition in the Insta-book crap collection.

If you want to be an independent thinker and form your opinion on the Israeli-Palestine troubles read Michael B Oren's 'Six days of war' (available on Amazon)
