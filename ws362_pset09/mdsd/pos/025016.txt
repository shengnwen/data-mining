The Lost World by Michael Crichton is a very fast paced novel. The story is suspensful and very differant from the movie (which I really didn't like).

The story revolves around Ian Malcom (mathamatican), Dr. Levine (dinosaur expert), and Sarah Harding (researcher in preditory behavior) traveling to a privatly owned island off the coast of Coasta Rica 6 years after Jurassic Park closes. This island was the island that made the dinosaurs for the park. The dinosaurs were released from the factory after they recieved a puzzleing disease. The dinosaurs took over the island. After Dr. Levine gets stuck on the island. The other people in the story must find him and, the most difficult part, make it out alive.

The only shortcoming of this book are the characters. They are just a little too unbelieveable. 

Overall it is a really good book for a sequel to Jurassic Park
