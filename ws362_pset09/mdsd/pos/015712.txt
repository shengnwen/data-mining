This book offers an insight into Clinton and his presidency, that is from an outsider- a reporter.  To say it is impartial is ridiculous, it is merely ambivalent.

At times, Harris seems enarmored by Clinton and at others like he is studying a bug.  But can he really know the inner machinations of the man and the office from his perch?  This is why his views are politicized, he constructs them as an outsider.

His writing is superior to Stephanopoulos, an insider and certainly to Clintons', making this an easier read
