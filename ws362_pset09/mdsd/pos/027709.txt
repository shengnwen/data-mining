In this book Melvyn Bragg presents, in an easy to read style, the story of the evolution of the English language.  Starting with the origins of Old English in the fifth century, he describes the impact on the language of the Viking invasion of England in the ninth century,  the enormous effect of the victory of the french-speaking Normans over the Anglo-Saxons at the Battle of Hastings, the breakthrough of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, how the publication of various bibles spread English to the households of Britain, and Shakespeare's preeminent impact on the development of the language.  The focus then shifts to the influence on English of colonial America, the Wild West, African Americans, the Indian subcontinent, the Caribbean and Australia.  His central thesis is that English is uniquely adaptive, absorbing other languages with which it comes into contact, thereby growing and becoming richer and more expressive.

This book is designed to accompany a PBS series to debut in 2006.  It is aimed at the typical PBS viewer.  The critical reviews on this site, which scold the author for not being more rigorous or scholarly, often seem to miss this point.  This is an excellent introduction to the origins of the English language.
