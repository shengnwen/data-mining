So, in this continuation of the series of friends from Somerville, MA (Read the Carriage House first) Susanna has secrets she finds she can't share with her husband Jack, and afraid of what her emotions mean to their marriage - she "runs" away from him.  When in danger he comes to her rescue only to find that she has to rescue him, too.  Oh my gosh - Neggers is a hidden gem and this just continues my love of her books that I just can't put down!  Just keep writing Carla
