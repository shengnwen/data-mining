Arno provides the opportunity for advancing your climbing, your business and personal life.  The opportunity to resolve  challenges in climbing and life are addressed in this book.  Arno offers a vision for improvement and understanding in the warrior's way.  This book and Arno's training afforded me unparalleled advancement in my climbing and my personal life.  As an individual who owns my own business and participates in many sports such as climbing, tennis, golf, snow skiing, and scuba diving to mention a few; the mental process of all these is sometimes overlooked in the application of physical ability.  Arno understands the importance of involving and training the mental element in climbing to catapult your performance in life.

I have taken classes from Arno as well as taken his Warrior Training course.  His training and guiding are mirrored here in this book.  I highly recommend this book and the application of this book in the rewarding experience of taking his classes also.
