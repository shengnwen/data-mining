What a villain this book contains.  It starts a bit slow, but builds to crescendo.  You won't want to put it down until you've finished.  Be aware, there's lots of weird sex info in this book, but it's part of the story that makes it all the more obsessive.  This is the third book by Greg Iles that I've read and I've really enjoyed every one of them.  Like Stephen King, he has a bit of a twisted mind in story telling, which I just love.  The villain in this book seems so demonic as to be other-worldly.  Pick it up, you'll enjoy the trip
