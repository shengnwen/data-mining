I thought this book was breathtaking.  J. Anthony Lukas does a masterful job telling the story of the Boston busing crisis from the perspective of 3 individuals involved (in 1974 a judge ordered the city of Boston to bus children into schools outside their own neighborhoods in order to achieve racial diversity; problems ensued).  You learn about a young, idealistic upperclass white man who works for Boston Mayor Kevin White, a poor black mother who is concerned for her children and their education, and an Irish Catholic family living in Charlestown who resent the changes being imposed on them by others.  Lukas tells you about each family's history and presents their story and perspectives in a way that you can understand and relate to.  

As a resident of Boston, I really enjoyed learning more about an important period of time for the city.  I think that by putting human faces to the story he personalized it for people who didn't experience it themselves.  Boston still does not have neighborhood high schools - students submit their top 3 choices and then are assigned to a school - and I would imagine this is a vestige of the 1974 court ruling.

A great book
