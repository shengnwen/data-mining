I bought this book for Computer Graphic Course for Animator class, and I found it really valuable because I wanted to learn much about history of computer softwares like painter, photoshop,and Maya.  Anyways, this book is superb!  This book is highly recommended for anyone who is interested in working in Entertainment industry
