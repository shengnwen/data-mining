Out of all the names in cookie books out there, Betty Crocker is one of the most, if not the most, famous. This fame was gained with good reason. Dozens of generations have grown on Betty's goodies and it shows in that she remains hugely popular throughout the years.

This book honors the Betty Crocker good name. Dozens of oh-so-yummy different recipes for eevryone to enjoy. The variety is quite astounding as she has more than enough cookies to fill up several chapters ranging from drop cookies, bar cookies, shaped cookies, kids cookies, etc. She even has a special chapter that's bound to become very useful in this day and age, dedicated to cookies for special diets. Here you'll find several treats for people on diets or with conditions such as diabetes or certain food allergies. I'd name some of the family's favorite recipes but there are really to many to mention!

Betty's instructions are, as usual, very simple to follow through and not only that, she even makes it easier on you by providing little tips on baking startegies, ingredient substitutions, etc. on almost all of the recipes. This makes it a cinch to turn out perfect cookies every time no matter what your baking skill is like.

I'd just like to highly recommend this book. It's a big favorite of my family and I've baked endlessly from it and not had anything fail me from it yet. They've been perfect as gifts, treats, to sell, and to cure the occasional boo-boo. This is as great as home-baked goodness can get
