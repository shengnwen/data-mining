This issue of Ascent is superior to some of the others. More professional and less flaky, it contains gripping trip reports and hilarious satire. The poetry is overall good, though very focused on the work of one author. The  photography is beautiful but too much of it is in black and white. I found  the reproduced paintings to be luridly colored and uninteresting. Overall,  though, this book is well worth reading, with highlights including  excellent work by Kelsey and Viola
