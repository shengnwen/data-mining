This book is filled with excellent photos with great descriptions.  The best historical book on spy hardware that I have ever seen. It does need to be re-proof read though... I noticed at least 3 spots where the text just ends in mid sentence which seemed really odd for a book of this caliber.  It's just a minor irritation but otherwise it's a 5 star book.
