   This book truly addresses the heart of the matter for most women when it comes to the fitness struggle and general wellness issues. Crystal Andrus leads her readers through a well explained and sensitively directed week by week transformation process that restores and connects the mind, the body and the spirit. After reading a multitude of books on weight loss and drastic nutrition programs, I feel that this book is the first one to address women's larger issues, such as willpower, self-esteem, and motivation.  
   This book has changed my life and has helped me finally see that the only person who can restore my life's vitality is me - not a pill, not a significant other and not one certain piece of equipment. 
   It has changed my life and I highly recommend it to every woman, no matter what age, stage in life or fitness level she may be
