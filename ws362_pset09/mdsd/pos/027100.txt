Very comprehensive and wide ranging collection of articles on the social,  ethical and policy implications of engineering.  In its second section,  Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Engineers, and to some extent in the  third section, Engineering Ethics and Public Policy, essays address actual  issues for engineers.  These essays are a refreshing change from essays  about technology and engineering that are actually general complaints about  modern life and modern values for which technology is blamed. The  individual essays are very thoughtful and well written.  Herkert's  introductions are substantive and help orient the reader to the issues, and  the author has even provided a useful index to the collection. It is good  to have this fine group of essays collected in one place.  The individual  essays will be of value and interest to many different audiences.  Since  all the essays are from the IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, taken  together they also provide an important window on the development of  discussions in engineering ethics, the social implications of engineering,  and engineering and policy in the last two decades.  In this respect is the  engineering counterpart of Rosemary Chalk's collection of papers from  SCIENCE magazine, Science, Technology, and Society
