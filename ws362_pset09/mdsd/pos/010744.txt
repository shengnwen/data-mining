When I was a kid in the fifties, the only comic book artist whose work I recognized on sight was Carl Barks.  Others knew him as "the Good Artist."  I had no name for him.  But I knew and loved his work.  It stood out as something special from the other artists who drew Donald and the other Disney duck characters, and he was my favorite.  Don Rosa, who wrote and drew "The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck," felt the same way.  And here Rosa demonstrates that he is the only artist truly worthy of inheriting the Barks mantle of "the Good Artist."  His loving retelling of the adventures of Uncle Scrooge, from his youth in Scotland to his adventures in Australia and the gold fields of Alaska, Rosa fills in the details hinted at by Barks, never violating what is already known about Scrooge, or the actual history of the times.  It's an exciting tale, beautifully drawn and written, and with the added bonus of extensive story notes by Rosa.  Definitely a work of art, and one from the heart.  Carl Barks would have been proud
