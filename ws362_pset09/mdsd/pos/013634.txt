This is an excellent (and well-written!) case study of bringing a popular product to market with infomercial marketing.   I liked it so much I read it cover to cover, which is rare for me.   I am recommending it to all my students at copywriting university. 

Emphasis on marketing, typical business production/legal issues, plus very motivating on persistence while being an entrepreneur.
I liked the testing details, copywriting and media buy numbers.. very eye-opening to me, and extremely insightful.
