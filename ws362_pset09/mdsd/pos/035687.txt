This book is over a hundred years old, but the information within still applies to all the subjects covered: sewing and mending, embroidery, applique, tapestry, knitting, crochet, tatting, macrame, and many varieties of lacemaking. Well-written and illustrated, the instruction is easily digested today -- no one will have trouble learning from these pages. My only complaint is that the original had many color plates which here have been reproduced as balck and white, and the paper on which it is printed is stark white. This makes for rather glaring, ugly pages. My aunt's edition from the 1930s is beautiful by comparison. I suppose the publisher was more concerned with keeping the cost down. Get the hardcover -- the book is quite thick and the paperback version will wear out quickly
