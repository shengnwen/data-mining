I enjoyed reading this book on vacation because it was fun to read in long stretches. I actually read 200 pages in one day.  It was one of those books that you can't wait to get back to.  I read this book AFTER I read THE QUEENS LOVER but chronologically this one might have been better to read before that one.  It is as close as you can get to a 'behind the scenes' look at the monarchy during the reformation
