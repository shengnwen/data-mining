After renting this tape many times over the years, I was happy to find  that Amazon.com carries it.  I purchased it and at the same time purchased  &quot;Golf My Way -- The Full Swing&quot;.  When they arrived, I found that  this tape, &quot;Golf My Way I -- Hitting the Shots&quot; is the original  tape that I have rented.  I also found that &quot;The Full Swing&quot; is  EXCERPTED from this one, so I returned it.  It states that plainly on the  cover, but that is not clear online.  One only needs this one tape.   Ordering both is not necessary
