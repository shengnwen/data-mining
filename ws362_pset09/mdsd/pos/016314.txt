Some might think that the characters in "Wildest Hearts" are boring and cliché, but JAK is known for her particular style of characterization, which obviously works considering the large JAK following.  In "Wildest Hearts," Oliver Rain and Annie Lyncroft exhibit JAK characterization at its best. Oliver like so many of JAK's heroes is aloof, controlled, business savvy and sexy. Annie is an original.  She is also intensely loyal. Unlike so many romance novels which focus on the "lovely" and "beautiful" virginal "miss," JAK waxes less on the physical and more on the sexual and romantic tension between the protagonists.  Among my favourite JAK books are the ones published by Pocket Books. A lot of these books have Seattle as a backdrop.  Those who know Seattle know that it's full of quirky out-of-the-box people. This unique backdrop is evident throughout "Wildest Hearts."  Note for instance, Ella Presswood, Melvin Finch et al.  JAK even has Oliver doing yoga.  Characterization aside, "Wildest Hearts" is a great story.  It moves smoothly without superfluous side stories, and even includes elements of suspense.  For those who consider themselves loyal JAK fans, "Wildest Hearts" is a sure winner
