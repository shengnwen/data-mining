I'm not sure I agree with the statement "EVERYTHING You Need To Know...".

The book was okay, but seemed to focus more on the driver than the business.  For example, he talks at length about his car and a lot of filler that I could do without.  However, he WAS a driver and has a lot of varied experiences to impart... and some good information!

I enjoyed the read, though I'd hoped for more "meat and potatos" in the book.  It is interesting and different from other books, though the author is obviously not "into" trucking so much as this is a simple point in his life that he shares and moves on.

He details some of his driving experiences, and I especially enjoyed the section called, "The Best Driving Job Of All".   This is about driving "show" trucks and the life.  I know of someone who actually does this and it is indeed the dream job.   So, I was very "into" that section.

He also makes points talking about being able to see stuff many people never will (his photo on the cover of a tornado coming right at him is an example).  I enjoy travel and "the road" (I got hooked driving between California and NC with a friend).  

I recommend this book, but you should expect an easy read and lots of fun sharing his experiences, rather than "Everything You Will Every Need To Know..."  BTW, a number of interesting B&W photos in the book!


Yeah, I might read more trucking stuff from this guy... if he writes it
