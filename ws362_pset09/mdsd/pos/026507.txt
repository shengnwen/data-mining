don't lump this in the self-help or dime-a-dozen leadership category. this is a unique, inspiring and thought-provoking book about life drawing on the experience of conductor extraordinaire ben zander and his wife rosamund.

i was led to this book by a brief documentary about the zanders i saw at a leadership training camp. the ideas are original and will stay with you a long time. this is the kind of book that once you read it, the world seems a little bit brighter
