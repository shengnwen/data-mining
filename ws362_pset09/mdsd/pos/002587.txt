Janet Fitch's descriptions and prose leave little to the imagination and she creates a punk world that is so graphic and believable that it could very well be called a work of genius. The first half of the book read smoothly, as Josie struggles to deal with the after-effects of Michael's death. I could vividly feel her emotions as she began to learn that the man she loved so strongly was not exactly who he seemed. 

The one problem I had was with the second half. I felt that she dealt too much with Josie's feelings for Michael. Living in Josie's head for the entire book, she became sort of unsympathetic to me. All she did was flounder around, thinking about Michael and while that is certainly believable in reality, it is not all that interesting to read two hundred pages of it. I even found myself skimming parts while she was staying with Meredith, lounging by the pool or smoking in the study, because it got so bogged down with her thoughts that I nearly got depressed myself
