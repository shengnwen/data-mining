If the quaternary elements of Book Four are the prose of Thelema, then volumes like this are its poetry. The book proves its worth early on by presenting a FULL A.'.A.'. curriculum, then explores deeper mysteries with Liber LXV and a brilliantly commented edition of Blavatsky's Voice of the Silence.

My only issue with the book is that much of this information can be obtained elsewhere, especially in online archives, but since when has that ever stopped people like us from buying another Crowley book? ;-)  AL II:
