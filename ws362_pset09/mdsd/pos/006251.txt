I'm not a scholar on this subject, but I enjoyed this book.  There are no bombshell revelations here, at least to the layman.  However, it is an insightful account of the atmosphere in which the German statesmen and diplomats worked.  It shows how the information flow was controlled by various people, in order to safegaurd their careers and lives.  In turn, this information control affected decision-making at the highest levels.  This book is also well-organized and concise, making it very easy to read
