Olivia is written and illustrated by Ian Falconer.  This book is the winner of the Caldecott Honor.  
Olivia is a book about a pig named Olivia.  She is good at lots of things like wearing herself out and other people out.   
Olivia lives with her mom, dad, her brother, Ian, her dog, Perry, and her cat named Edwin.  
When Olivia gets dressed, she tries on everything in red.  
On sunny days, Olivia likes to go to the beach.  She is good at building sand castles. On rainy days, she likes to go to the museum.
Olivia is never sleepy!
My favorite part of the book is when Olivia's mother is putting her to bed.  Her mother gives her a kiss and says, "You know, you really wear me out.  But I love you anyway."  Then Olivia says, "I love you anyway too."
I recommend this book to everyone because Olivia is a great character and the pictures have lots of detail.  This is a book you will enjoy reading over and over again
