If you are goign to read one book on the American Revolutionary War, this one is an excellent candidate. It starts in 1763, during the years leading up to the actual conflict. It ends in 1789 with Washington as president and the ratification of the constitution. 

Covering this many years, the book has to be big, and it is. And by including so much material, a lot of material may not be of interest to all readers. For instance, as you would expect, a major part of the book is taken up with the battles fought between the Americans and the British. But there is also a lot of material on the earlier battles with the French and Indians, and a lot on the various debates among the colonists on very fundamental issues such as reconcile their troubles with England or fight the strongest army in the world over what they would consider to be treason; and on the basic question of slave holding. 

An area I particularly enjoyed was the discussion of the writing of the constitution. Starting from scratch how would you set up a government of checks and balances? Hou would you define something that would still be around more than 200 years later with relatively few changes? 

Today the two parties seem to be at each others throat even more than in the past. But this is probably not true. Adams called Jefferson 'a howling atheist' in the 1800 campaign, and the articles and letters about Lincoln as vicious as Michael Moore talking about Bush. Still what was done between 1763 and 1789 remains. As much as people complain about the current president, we still consider ourselves Americans and we hold to the constitution - even though we argue a lot about what it says
