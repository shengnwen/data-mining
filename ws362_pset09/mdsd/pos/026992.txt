   I am a teacher and bought this book at my school's book fair.  I actually really liked the cover.  That is what caught my eye.  Anyway, this was a pretty good book.  Fairly dark and gloomy--not an uplifting book by any means.  But, the writing flowed and I found myself reading on.  My daughter is into fantasy books, so I believe this book would appeal to kids who like that type of writing.  There are worse books out there that try to appeal to kids.
