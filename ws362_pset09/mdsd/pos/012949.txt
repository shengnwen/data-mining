I first purchased and read "Agile Software Development with SCRUM" after talking at length with Ken Schwaber at a software development conference in 2001.  

I find some of terminology used in the Scrum process to be a bit trite - such as "Pigs and Chickens" - but the approach itself is solid.  Overall, I'm sold on the process, and have employed many of Scrum's concepts in projects I've managed.

Scrum focuses on delivering maximum quality and predictability of the software development process with minimum overhead.  The book is rather expensive given its length, but is a really good and thought-provoking introduction to a means of managing software development in way that empowers the folks who do the actual development while ensuring that those with a vested interest in the results get a reasonable quality deliverable (or deliverables) in a timely manner; and have a well defined means of tracking progress and providing guidance or feedback before it is too late for an off-track project to get back on course.

Anyone working to start-up a new software development project should read this book, if for no other reason then to gain insights into what really matters when managing such a project; how to manage without needlessly burdening the team members, or destroying their creativity and enthusiasm; and how to ensure that external forces do not cause a project to spin out of control.

On a final note - if you ever get a chance to hear Mr. Schwaber speak, definitely take the opportunity - though a bit salty, he is both entertaining and informative, and very good at responding to questions from his audience - well worth listening-to!
