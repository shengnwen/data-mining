Indu weaves a magic of sights, sounds and smell of Mughal empire. Historical background not withstanding it touches upon a strong emotion - Desire. The desire to become rich, powerful and to possess. It is easy to identify with searing ambition of Salim (Jehangir) and his ability to create rules for others and not for himself. The novel beautifully depicts the transformation of Mehrunissia controlled by her first husband to Noor Jehan who controls the entire Muhgal Empire through her second one. Like anybody else, I am not a great fan of sequels. However this book made me read the sequel - Feast of roses
