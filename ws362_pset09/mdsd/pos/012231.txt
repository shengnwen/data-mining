This is an amazing chess book i really enjoy reading it, Soltis did a very good job. 

This book can definitly make you a better chess player , it will improve your endgame tehnique  and your ability to win a won game . 

Its not an engame book its a book that it will help you  transpose a won midle game position to a won engame position and teach you how to get the hole point without any real difficulty. 

I bought 3 copies of this book and gave the 2 as a present to two of my best friends and chess players and they are still thanking me about my desition !! i am glad i did that !

All players can benefit from this book but i think it will most help intermediate and advance chess players.

I recommend this great book
