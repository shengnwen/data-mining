I have purchased nearly all the books from the Junie B. Jones collection.  My daughter enjoys listening to me read them to her.  We originally got one book through scholastic book club through the school and I literally read that book to her over and over again.  Having a good amount of the collection just makes it more diversified for me ~ and keeps me interested too.

The books are well written.  A girl can identify with the subjects of the book and even though the books are long, they are not so long that 2 or 3 chapters a night doesn't complete the story in 3 nights.  

I highly recommend the collection to anyone with a girl in the lower grades at school.
