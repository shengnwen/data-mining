this book you can call part 2 of "a new beginning". our 6 teenagers find themselves in the state of oregon when they run into trouble. they pull off the road onto a side road and run across a deserted mansion and decide to spend the night. they soon start to get the suspicion that they are not alone and that something or someone is haunting the mansion.  they also find that no matter how far they run that they cannot escape their past for it will come back to haunt them. this book starts out brilliantly but the climax to me was someone of a letdown. i loved keven ryan's first book "a new beginning" but this one was not nearly as good. it seems he ran out of ideals and had to improvise and that ruined a lot of the climax. but to all roswell fans who miss the show dearly, it is worth reading and i can't wait until "pursuit" hits the bookstores
