Book Review

The book I am reviewing is Crash, written by Jerry Spinelli.  I think this book deserves four stars. The story is about John or "Crash" Coogan going to school, having fun, and playing football. It is terrific because the characters change their ways throughout the book. Penn Webb, a math geek, and John "Crash" Coogan, a football player, are so different from one another, but will this be changed by the end of the book? This book is about John learning that you cannot bully kids just because they are smaller than you. Never judge who and who cannot be your friends.   A problem occurs when John is a troublemaker and a rule breaker, but this soon changes when the kids he bullies become his friends. I would recommend this book to someone who likes football and comedy. Other books by this author are Loser, Wringer, and Star girl.
