I have a lot of books but learned so much from this one that was completely new to me. Lots of great foundational truth for jewelry making; lots of inspiration to go off in your own direction; lots of information on how to get there. Some but not a lot of step-by-step projects to copy, more like a "user's manual" for tools and materials, with an eye on good design principles. Lots of info on wire-work which I'm shocked to discover is almost as addicting as the beads themselves
