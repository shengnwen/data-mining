As a couple therapist, I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it does an excellent job of compiling much of the latest research on the brain, attachment theory and relationships and helps us to understand why we behave the way we do in relationships.  It also challenges us to do better and guides us on we can pay more attention to nurturing love in our lives.  This is a must read for anyone working with couples
