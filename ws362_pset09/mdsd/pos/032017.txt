This is a delightful, readable book that got me excited about travel.  I've done some "partial" solo travel, so I could really relate to the author's stories. I especially loved her tales, some sad and some laugh-out-loud funny. She had many useful ideas for dining alone, packing your bags, dealing with strangers and loneliness, planning ahead and so much more. Her many experiences (some were amazing) just whetted my appetite to get on a plane. Can't wait to read Ms Lane's next book (while I'm enroute to some exotic destination!).
