This book brought a sadness that I can not explain. It is amazing that this book, which is in a diary form, is possibly happening to a Nepali girl right now. Sold told a story of a young girl who was taken away and sold into the sex trade in India. There she had to deal with older men having sex with her and not be able to stop them, or get hurt by Mumtaz. I liked the ending because the girl gets out alive with an American who goes around and rescues girls from the sex trade. Hands down I recommend people to read this book because it will help everyone realize what is happening to young girls all over the world.
