15% of the population could be harmed by low-fat diets and unless you like playing Russian roulette with your life, you should find out if you're one of them (it requires a specific type of cholesterol test). This book is backed up by scientific studies and goes into relevant details of different types of cholesterol particles. It does take some effort to extract the infomation that is spread throughout the book but it is well within reach of most readers and well worth the effort.

I've read a number of books on preventing heart disease and this one is reccomended because it gives extremely important information you will not find in magazine articles, brochures, or other books. It goes into excellent detail on diet and exercise. The only reason why I think these facts aren't better known is that the extra complexity would confuse some people and cause a few to not to adopt low fat diets which is beneficial to most people.
