I think this Robert Ludlum's single best piece of work.  It is perhaps his most suspenseful work, full of his typical twists and turns, but at a seemingly higher level than many of his other thrillers.  The interaction of Scofield and Taleniekov throughout the novel is very well written, yet it is the Corsican secret society of The Matarese that really makes this tale the best of Ludlum's stories.  I really would like to see a movie made of this book, because it could be a very, very good one, if done right (which sadly doesn't happen much of the time)
