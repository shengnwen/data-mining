Pauline Maier, currently the Willian R. Kenan Jr. Professor of American History at MIT, received her Ph.D from Harvard in 1968, one year after the publication of The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution, written by her advisor and mentor Bernard Bailyn.  In "From Resistance to Revolution," Maier builds upon the framework constructed by Bailyn to articulate her own answer to the Progressive and New Left interpretations of the Revolution.  Maier is not so concerned about the sources of revolutionary thought as she is with tracking the development of the colonists' perception of themselves, their government and the British people.  Maier, like her mentor, is convinced that "Real Whig" philosophy played a crucial role in the Revolution, yet she acknowledges that not every colonist "spent his evenings reading Francis Hutcheson's System of Moral Philosophy."  Furthermore, in her words, "To acknowledge the importance of ideology in the evolution of the American revolutionary movement is not, however, to claim that ideology explains why men became revolutionaries" (xiv). 

It is apparent that Maier was taught well by Bernard Bailyn.  She has a captivating writing style that weaves her research throughout a well-crafted prose.  Maier deserves special praise for tying events across the Atlantic-and even the Mediterranean-with the American resistance, and later revolutionary, movements.  The most serious shortcoming of this book is its focus on New England, very little attention is given to events in the Middle Colonies and the South.  Yet despite whatever shortcomings this book may have it is a valuable contribution to understanding the development of the American revolutionary effort.
