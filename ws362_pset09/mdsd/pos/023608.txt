The study guide is enough to pass the test.  It contains all the material on the exam that you will need.  I strongly recommend using the two CD's to implement a study network and doing the labs.  I also read the book, cover-to-cover, twice.. then went back and re-read security and zenworks.  The day before the test I used Exam Cram online resources to review. I have no prior Novell experience and was only A+ certified prior to this exam.  The study took me one month at about 4 to 5 hours a day.  The book DOES contain editorial errors, such as referring to incorrect Figures or tables and a few incorrect statements.  Read carefully or you will not pick up on it when it happens
