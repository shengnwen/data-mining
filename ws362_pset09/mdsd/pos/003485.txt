This work is the bible of divine action. I have been studying the correlation between quantum indeterminism and divine action (in-depth) for the last five years and have found Dr. Lameters book to be worth its weight in gold. Lameter has done what others have hitherto been unable; Namely, to convey in a SIMPLE yet ACCURATE  manner both the mind-numbing concepts of quantum physics and the fascinating consonace between quantum uncertainty and divine action. 

Trained uder the great Nancy Murphy (who is a modern day Icon in this field) Lameter has pushed the envolope of human understanding and expanded the horizons of both science and theology. This work is destined to usher mankind into the next phase of scientific enlightenment. A phase where theology and science will work as a dyad under the methodological tenets of the emerging metacientific paradigm. Rocco Bon
