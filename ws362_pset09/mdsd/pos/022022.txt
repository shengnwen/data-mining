This is an excellent story of the Dieppe Raid conducted in 1942. This raid was, of course, a disaster with the Canadian division losing an incredible number of men. The story of the raid is well told, and the details well told. 

More important, however, is the authors understanding of the overall implications of the raid. 

After the disaster all of the military leaders involved rushed to find something to say that could put some saving grace onto the operation. It has become almost understood that this was a precusor to D-Day and that the lessons learned at Dieppe saved thousands on D-Day. The author asks: If this was the plan, why wasn't it mentioned in the before mission planning? 

Later on, in North Africa Montgomery often expressed a very low opinion of the Americans as a fighting force. This was just after Kasserine Pass. Montgomery conveniently had forgotten that the British took a while to work up to professionalism as well. And one of the steps along the way was Dieppe. 

This book is worth it for just Mr. Niellands excellent analysis, and worth it even if you know everything about Dieppe
