I read "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" last year, and have just completed this one.  I'm very glad that I have "Singin' And Swingin' ready to start the minute I finish this review.  As I was reading, I kept seeing a vision of Maya at our local theatre where she gave several readings of her works a few years ago.  I'm very proud and happy that I've had the good fortune to see her in person.  This live performance helped me to appreciate this remarkable woman even more than I would have normally.  She is truly a "phenomenal woman".  If you have not read her autobiography yet, I strongly suggest you start asap. To say this book is interesting and fascinating would be selling it short.  As I begin her next volume, I'm quite certain that I will not be disappointed
