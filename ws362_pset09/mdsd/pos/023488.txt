I adored this book when I was a kid (some 30 years ago) and since then I have read it out loud to lots of kids -- including groups in hospitals and at libraries.  They always love it -- expecially the age 3 to 5 crowd.  The  illustrations are very simple, but really appealing to kids.  It's also a  terrific book for beginning readers since the vocabulary is pretty simple
