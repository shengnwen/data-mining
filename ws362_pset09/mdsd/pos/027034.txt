This book definitely gives a new perspective on how to view sexual encounters as a Christian. Do not let the title scare you away from reading the book. Even if you do not agree or follow all the principles illustrated within the book it provides insight on what God calls us to be and has an excellent array of scriptures. Recently this book has been re-released under a new title. May want to check that out too. That one is definitely 5 stars
