I bought this book unknowing that it was about hobgoblins who live in the forest and kidnap children.  After they kidnap a child, the oldest hobgoblin in the group exchanges lives with that child.  So, the child becomes the hobgoblin and the hobgoblin becomes a human again - a changeling.  I don't normally read fantasy books like this so, at the beginning, I was leary.  To my surprise, I found myself reading it every chance it got.  It wasn't real life but it was a nice break from it.  I found it interesting, suspenseful in parts - and when I take walks in the woods, I think twice about what or who is out there with me
