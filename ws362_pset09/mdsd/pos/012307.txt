Peter is a very well written book, is blunt, honest - almost painfully so - and NOT rife with typical stereotypes. It's not written in a high school setting where hormones are hopping out of everyone's garments. Instead, it takes place in the street, in the homes of the main characters, on the bike paths, and in Peter's head.

There was definitely a language barrier given the Aussie lingo. But it wasn't much of a holdup. You got the idea.

I did think that Peter's realizations about himself - after learning that his brother's friend David was a "poof" - came a bit too quickly. However, everyone comes to grips with their sexuality at their own pace. Sometimes the revelations don't even occur to a person until they're in their 20s, sometimes people know from birth. So it is entirely believable that Peter had absolutely no thoughts about boys whatsoever until he met David. Still, this is dubious, because let's face it, hormones are flying at an incomprehensible rate, so who was he fantasizing about? That topic is rarely discussed in gay teen literature. Perhaps it's thought of as too taboo.

However, once he started making the connection, his process was extremely believable. I particularly enjoyed the double dates he went on, and his rejection of Gloria. Walker's description of Gloria, for what it's worth, was spot on. David's support, when he hugged and held him, was truly a touching scene.

I loved that this book contained very, very few stereotypes. There was a slight overemphasis on the "masculinity" of bike riding and cars, but aside from that, I could find little fault.
