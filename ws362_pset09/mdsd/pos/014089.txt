I bought this book because I saw some beaded flowers at a craft show and I thought I'd like to learn to do it myself. I had a little difficulty with the techniques in the beginning, but with practice and by frequently referring to the very nice, detailed pictures in the book, I finally got the hang of it and completed a fine looking poppy (if I do say so myself). I have since complete two other projects. I wouldn't go so far as to say the projects are easy or simple, but they are imminently doable. And last but not least, they provide the beader with a real sense of accomplishment
