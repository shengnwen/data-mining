When I was young, I was told that Walt Whitman was a marvelous poet.  I read some 
parts of Leaves of Grass but I was not impressed.  Now, when I am old,I have    
 recently met a young poet who thinks highly of Whitman as the Father of 
Modern American Poetry.  Therefore, I decided to try him again.
    I bought a copy of Leaves of Grass with an introduction by Justin Kaplan.  
First I read Kaplan's introduction; then I read Leaves of Grass four times.
After the second reading, I finally 'got it'.  Then I wanted to learn more 
about Whitman so I sent for Kaplan's biography of Whitman.
    I found this biography answered many questions I had about Whitman's life.
Kaplan's writing is very accessible and extremely informative.  He cites 
contemporary sources for facts about Whitman's life.  I would recommend 
this book highly to anyone who wants to know more about Walt Whitman.
(I just hope my review comes through cyberspace intact.  This space keeps
cutting off the ends of words.
