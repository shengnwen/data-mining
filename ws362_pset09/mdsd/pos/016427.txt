Obsessed is a spiritual thriller about stolen treasures, stolen lives, and personal obsessions. Among its characters are Holocaust survivors and unrepentant Nazi war criminals. Set alternately in a Nazi concentration camp (Turon, Poland during 1944-45) and 1973 Los Angeles, this is the story of a man seeking answers to the mystery of a Jewish mother that he never knew and of two mothers who made supreme sacrifices. 
I enjoyed every minute of it, although some of the main character's decisions and plans seemed too distorted by his obsessions. Overall, Obsessed is a very good read!
