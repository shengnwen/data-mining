I could NOT put this book down!  The writing, documentation, pictures are flawless! To think this came from a son that knew nothing of his father's background is amazing. I grew up as a WWII brat with a hatred of the "Japs". 10-11 yrs old.  Instead of Cowboys and Indians we played war.  All these years that prejudice stayed with me. "Flyboys" gave me a whole different perspective. Our service men who fought and died during that time will always be honored. Mr. Bradley you MADE ME THINK and I thank you for that. Iwo Jima is a name that will resonate down through history and I think you will too as an author who should be required reading in every college.  Again thank you.  M
