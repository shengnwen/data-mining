This book was packed full of pictures of tablesettings, centerpieces, favors, placecards, etc.  All of the little details and ideas for the reception tables were great!  Don't expect much planning advice.  Good for someone looking for decor ideas.  The book is also smaller than most, which makes it easier to carry when meeting with the florist or catering manager
