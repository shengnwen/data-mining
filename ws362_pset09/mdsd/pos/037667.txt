While this book isn't perfect, it is certainly a very nice introduction for the average person to systems theory and its implications to other areas.

I basically agree with some of the criticisms in the spotlight reviews about the flatland or a web of life vs. a heirarchy (or even better holarchy) both in nature and in other spheres of life.  For example, in a holarchy is a heirachy of wholes that are part of larger wholes in the way that atoms make up molecules, molecules make up cells, collections of cells make up a tissue, etc.  This is concept is underplayed in this book, but it seems to be true inside and outside of nature.  Ken Wilber offers a more complete explanation of this concept in A BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYTHING and many other writings.

I also think it's important to keep in mind that a systems view is an outside look of a collective.  Empiricism represents an outside look of some single topic.  I think it is also necessary to look at the interiority of both individuals and collectives to get a complete understanding of something as complicated as life, politics, religion, etc.  I don't think system theory alone is the magic bullet.

This book is relatively short, easy to follow and provides a nice introduction to systems theories and some other important topics.  It has some shortcomings, but it is basically solid although there is a bias toward a "flatland" view of nature and reality.  If you supplement reading it with some other material such as the book I mentioned above, it may open up some new horizons for you.

Happy reading... I hope you found my interview helpful.  Feel free to leave comments if you wish
