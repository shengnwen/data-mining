If it weren't for the reviewers I would have missed it.  How does one navigate through the zillions of &quot;self help&quot; books out there to find the real gems?  The reviewers  pushed me to the purchasing point.(thank you!)  The author Jean Jensen shows us real life examples of the stumbling blocks children of abusive parents have as adults, in the workplace and in their love lives.  At the end of the book are wonderful examples of people like you and me who explain how they moved through their own personal life struggles with the help of regression therapy.  Jean Jenson thoroughly explains her method in a considerate manner and gives a variety of  covert and overt abusive acts so you will relate, as opposed to deny.  You may have to read this a few times because the source of our problems wants us to react in an opposite direction to healing.  Jenson helped me see a way out and up, and she certainly covered all the bases to healing, covering many of my questions I could not find answers to with conventional therapy
