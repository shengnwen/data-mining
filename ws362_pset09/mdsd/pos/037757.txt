"Start Your Own Business" is a great book for the first time business owner, or anyone who is thinking about owning a business.  The book covers a wide range of topics from idea conception, to choosing a business structure, obtaining financing, performing market research, buying equipment, basic accounting, etc.  This book covers almost every topic related to starting a business.

That being said, the book doesn't go into great detail on most of the topics, it merely introduces each aspect and explains the most important parts.  However this book is quite incomplete without additional information.

Regardless this book has some great information in an easy to read format.  The book includes some great web sites that give more information on particular topics but I wish that the author would have included more book recommendations.  

If you are thinking about owning your own business, this book is for you.  But if you already own a business, this may be too elementary for you.  But if not, I highly recommend this book.  5 out of 5 stars
