The book Skeleton Crew by Stephen King is a fiction horror novel with ideas so fresh and original that It will keep you in your seat until your done with it. Rather then being one long story, the book is composed of several short stories. Some of the stories can span over almost 30 pages, while some are maybe as little as three or four pages. 
The Fog, which is the first story in the book, it is also the longest one. The story is about a man and his family living on their lake house. The story starts of slowly discussing what the dad is doing and following him around town. Then one night a huge storm hits the lake and all the residence flee for their homes. Rain crashes down on them and trees get pulled out of the ground as the family huddles together in their house. In the mourning the family awakens to a strange fog out on the lake. The fog seems solid almost like a wall. Eventually the dad goes to the market were the fog seems to have almost creped up over the whole town. But when people start disappearing in the fog the family has to fend for their lives as the ever-consuming fog rolls in all around them.
Another great story is The Monkey. The story is about a toy monkey that seems to follow the main character everywhere always seeming to bring bad luck wherever he goes. As the main character tries to get rid of him the monkey always seems to find a way back 
The last story ill talk about is titled The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands. The whole story takes place around a card game.  As the men are playing a stranger wanted to sit in with them. The mean allow him to play but they notice that the man never makes human contact. This story was short but had a very interesting end.
Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The great ideas and concepts that made you ask yourself if this could actually happen. I would recommend this book to any one that would be interested in talking a walk on the other side.
