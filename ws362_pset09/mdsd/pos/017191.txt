Rosen's book is not unlike the work of Joseph Ellis ("American Sphinx", "Founding Brothers"), in that it focuses largely on character as a force in the development of the court. Rosen pairs various players (Black and Douglas, Rehnquist and Scalia) and the contrasts are revealing. But after awhile, it's pretty obvious which side Rosen is going to come down on as he moves from Marshall's era to Harlan's, and so on toward the end. Still, the book is an entertaining and informative read, a neat summary of where the court has been and how it got there. Perhaps more important, Rosen deftly delineates the core issues involving the interpretation of the Constitution, from the pragmatists to the strict constructionists, and everyone in between. Although Bob Woodward's "The Brethren" is a much deeper look at the Court (notably, Burger's), Rosen's book is a useful place to start.
