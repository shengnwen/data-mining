I first read "Echoes of the Soul" about 5 years ago & recently decided to read it again, & I'm glad I did!  This book has so many thought provoking insights, thoughts, ideas, & examples that it would be really difficult to remember, think about/consider & learn from them all in just 1 read.

"Echoes of the Soul" covers a wide range of topics concerning the life of our souls, including: the planning of each of our incarnations, when souls enter the body, the death process, what life is like on "the Other Side", and much, much more.  The author also discusses the importance of quieting our minds to hear our "still, small voice", as well as creating & maintaining a relationship with God.

Overall, I would highly recommend this book for those who are interested in spirituality - it definitely has a lot to offer
