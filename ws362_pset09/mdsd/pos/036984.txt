Bumby-backed fish was sick, and need red algae to get better.  So Rainbow fish, and Blue fish decided that hey would venture into the monsters cave where the red algae was.  They had to do it unless bumpy-back fish would die.  As they traveled through, they say many scary things, but were too afraid to actually look at the scary things.  The fish finally made it out and were able to get some red algae.  On their way back they found out something very interesting.  This is a pretty good story that tells a moral on now to be afraid of something just because you don't know what it is, like being afraid of the dark
