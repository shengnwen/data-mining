While there are no pages left to read, this remarkable story still haunts my thoughts and occupies many of my conversations. "The Secret History" is destined to be a classic. Not only is it beautifully and artfully written, but the story is completely original- unlike anything I've read before. (Comparrisons to "Crime and Punishment" abound, but should be disregarded; apart from a first-person perspective on committing an unthinkable crime, there is so much more to this story, especially in terms of the various relationships and phenomenal character development.) 

Simply put, the plot goes something like this: when the narrator Richard moves from California to enroll in Hampden College in Vermont, he becomes intrigued by a close-knit group of students studying the Classics with a seemingly unconventional professor. Upon gaining entry into their classes and subsequently their lives, he becomes entangled in a murder of a friend. However, there is SO much more to the book and the characters than I would want anyone to know prior to reading this novel.  

This book is not only a wonderful choice for book clubs, but would be an interesting requirement (or recommended reading) for various courses in psychology, sociology, criminology, and of course literature and the Classics. 

I can not rave highly enough about this novel and hope it continues to garner tremendous success. I look forward to reading more from this author, and would love if someone made this into a movie!
