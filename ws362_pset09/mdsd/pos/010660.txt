How did an outsider, a foreign nobleman understand more about American democracy than so many learned observers from within? What gave DeTocqueville the capacity to understand fundamental characteristics of American life in such a way that even today his categories of description are  meaningful to us? 
DeTocqueville so some of the unique qualities of the American genius,the American capacity for association and free action together, the capacity to deal with the small details of everyday practical life while dreaming in the broadest terms.He saw the danger in this most democratic of societies of a tyranny of the majority which might make real freedom in difference of opinion difficult to maintain. He foresaw that two giants , the United States and Russia would at one stage come to take over the center of world political life. He marvelled at the rich capacity of Americans to risk and set out for the country ahead, to be pioneers westward. 
He saw much about America which it is still possible to see today. And yet given the vast changes technical civilization has brought about, given the tremendous developments in all areas of human learning it is difficult to say that DeTocqueville can be the true and proper guide to the path of American democracy today. 
What can be said is that he was the pioneer social observer who saw more into the essence of America than any native American did. And in doing so he left us a great literary classic rich in profound observations most of which are of course are not even hinted at in this small review.
