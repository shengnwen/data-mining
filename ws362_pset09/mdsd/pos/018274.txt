A complete, up-to-date textbook for medical students detailing everything needed to pass medicine exams feeling confident.  The diagrams and at-a-glance sections are particularly helpful.  There are more detailed books, but this covers everything necessary (and more) and what it does, it does well.  Could be used either as a standard text or as a revision guide, due to the at-a-glance features.  Easy to read and attractively laid out - this is a nice all-round medical textbook
