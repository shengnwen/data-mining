I just read this book and have integrated the info into a plan to re-design my website.  Over the past 2 years I've heard a lot of information about SEO, some of it conflicting.  This book helped me sort that all out in a clear and concise fashion.  I have not yet implemented the plan, so I can't speak for how effective the author's recommendations are.  However, the info is well presented and seems sound, looking forward to applying it
