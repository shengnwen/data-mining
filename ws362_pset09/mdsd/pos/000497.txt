Teachers and intermediate aged students will find this book full of interesting information about many well known explorers.  What they won't find are exaggerated claims, found in some social studies text books, of  the bravery and importance of well known explorers.  Written in interesting  prose, each chapter of this book reveals the foibles, faults and mission of  an explorer.  A valuable resource for teachers, this book will help balance  dry, older or current textbook writing that rarely hints at the darker side  of history.  Students will be surprised by the human qualities, both light  and dark, of these historical figures.  This book provides information but  allows them to make up their own mind about the importance of these  explorers' role in history
