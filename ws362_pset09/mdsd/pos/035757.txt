Although this work is basically a broad survey of the sources on early American education, Bailyn makes some important suggestions that ache to be brought full circle.  He demonstrates how scholarship on this subject have  been marred by a tendency to view everything in the light of a gradual  progression to compulsory public education.  He also notes how this has  caused a large amount of distortions and myths to be created, with the  result of quite near everyone making absurd and innance assumptions about  the past.  Moreover, the true nature of education in early education has  been largely lost to the world, despite the fact that there are ample  sources waiting to be exploited.  This book should be especially  fascinating to anti-public education libertarians, who, of course, view the  growth of public education of the modern form as a serious regression in  society.  This work could serve as a starting point for a history taking up  the libertarian point of view; an invaluable undertaking no doubt
