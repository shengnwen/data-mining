This is a highly readable adventure involving challenges related to nature, politics, clashes with native people in the lands encountered that is totally engrossing. The men who sailed the world's oceans during the age of exploration were truly some of the most incredible examples of courage and fortitude we have in history.
Bergreen does a great job of providing detail and using his source material to synthesize both the day to day challenges they met but also to give the reader some insight into Magellan the man,in addition to other key members of the expedition without detracting at all from the narrative flow of the story.
Ultimately Magellan was done in by his own hubris, taking the expedition in a direction that wasn't intended during his encounters with the native people he tries to convert to Christianity. Bergreen points to his strained relations with his crew and surmises that this may have contributed to a sense of relief when he finally falls.
All in all I highly recommend this account of one of history's more daring adventures.
