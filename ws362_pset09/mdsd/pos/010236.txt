From the book:
This introduction provides basic literary and historical information on each of the twenty-seven writings of the New Testament, but it also orients readers to the religious, theological, and ethical issues related to the message and meaning of Jesus Christ. By giving special emphasis to how the New Testament has helped shape the church's identity and theological outlook throughout the centuries and the role it has played within the broader cultures of both East and West, this book assists readers in exercising creative, informed leadership within their own communities of faith. A distinctive feature of the book is its simultaneous publication in two formats: a standard printed edition with comprehensive yet detailed coverage; and the Expanded CD-ROM Version, which includes supporting endnotes, extensive annotated bibliographies on each New Testament book, additional maps, diagrams, and charts, and other resources for classroom use and personal study
