Merton is among those writers who profoundly affirm Wallace Stevens' fixation on 'the determining presence of the personality of the artist', speaking of the component values of any literary work.  Published in 1956, 'The Silent Life' discloses a still undistracted Merton, brilliant and pure like a god.  His unseen life as priest and religious, and a personal and abiding inclination for an intense eremitic life (his ever seeking the hermitage was a desire never really requited for him), color the emotion of his discourse here.  It burns like the prose of 'Sign of Jonas' and 'Waters of Siloe'.  It's a later, wiser Merton opened and deepened that arrests and shows us ourselves, it really is;  but reading this book you're made to wonder if Thomas Merton was ever again so ecstatically fastened to the Ideal of his fantastically converted heart.  Such a language of love to serve the most clement scholarship!  &amp; best thing, it sings with all his determining love and confidence.  Merton always expressed a particular affection for the pure hermits of Camaldoli, and the time he spends lovingly tracing their importance is one of the  best parts of this book.  Thomas Merton changed monasticism both by his devotion and his disaffection.  This book's a good example of his already profound literary gifts, and an even better example of a man's purposeful race toward the God within
