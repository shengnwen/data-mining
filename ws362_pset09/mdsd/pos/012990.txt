Much better than I expected, a serious work with a great deal of research invovled.  It avoided the typical lurid embellishments of the genre, and also made the point of the important period of transistion in the Gorbachev period, where nascent Russian capitalism started.  It lacks somewhat in that it focuses on only six men, and they are of varying importance in the post-Yeltsin period.  As Putin reportedly said when asked about Berezovsky--&quot;Who?&quot;  Nevertheless, a good job, an interesting read and thankfully avoids falling into the tabloid style of so much of the literature on the topic
