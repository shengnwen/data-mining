This is a well-written book on the subject of process or business reengineering. It is written in a non-technical language, wastes few words, and covers the entire spectrum of topics that are essential to a successful  reengineering effort. The discussions place a significant emphasis on the  role that information or computer technology play today in the  reengineering effort, particularly how this technology can facilitate the  overall effort. I found the book largely sticking to the overall thread  however at times it did become a wee bit academic to flip through the  sections.  All in all, a very good read
