The Perfect Storm belongs to a genre of historical writing
that involves the telling of a tale as a narrative and then
retelling it on every other possible level. So the story of 
a fishing boat, the Andrea Gail, that's lost in a storm
with all six of its crew is the at the core.

The next layer is  recounted as a journalist's reconstruction 
of the days leading up to the voyage and the reasons that 
each of the six men went fishing. Then there's the layer about
meteorology and one about commercial fishing and its 
realities and another about rescue operations. There is even
a final layer about the physiology of death by drowning
that's accompanied by some speculations about what that 
experience would be like.

Junger's writing is clinical and it would be easy to
be put off by it, but for me, the writer's detachment only
added to the horror of the story and the emotional impact.
As a bonus (like on those re-issued DVD's) there the 
equally chilling story of the loss of a storm jumper and 
the gut-chilling stories of the survivors of the fishermen.

Some of the extra material feels like padding and that is the 
only reason that this isn't a five star review. In any
case, an excellent read that will be sure to cost you some
sleep. If you like this, you might want to check out John
McPhee's Oranges or the perfectly terrifying Devil in the 
White City.
