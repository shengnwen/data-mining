When I was assigned this book for summer reading I didn't think anything more about it than any other book on the list, but once I found out what it was about I was hooked. the story is truly inspirational and intriguing. I was surprised to find my own grandfather had worked at the south pole station, though not the same one and knew a bit about what the boook described. It is struly a book that will grab your attention and make you desire to know how Jerrie is doing today.
