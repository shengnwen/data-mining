I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good terrain walk on a civil war battlefield. Transcribed from tapes of former National Park Service Chief Historian Edwin Bearss' battlefield tours, "Fields of Honor" provides a chronological, operational overview of the American Civil War by discussing two or three battles from each year of the war.

As I read I could take a break, close my eyes and easily imagine myself at Gettysburg or Shiloh, a cool breeze drying the sweat on my face as I hiked up to a point of interest with a small group, ready to hear Mr Bearss' insights on the fight.

This book is a great primer for anyone new to reading about the war as it covers the better known battles and places them in context, and maintains a decent balance between the Eastern and Western theaters. It is also a treat for the more experienced student to accompany Ed Bearss, albiet virtually, as he teaches the reader to look at familiar ground in a new way.

The highlight of this book is the chapter on Mr Bearss' involvement with raising the USS Cairo from the Yazoo River. Its greatest drawback is the (all too common in books about battles) lack of detailed maps. Keep a good Civil War atlas or your Trailhead Graphics maps handy
