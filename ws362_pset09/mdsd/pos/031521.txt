Mona Charen's "Do-Gooders" is an excellent book because it presents the not-so-often heard conservative side of the argument about the liberal problem we face in this country.  She manages to do something in her writing that the left is ages away from. She presents well organized well thought out proven points about the negative effects of today's liberalism WITHOUT personally attacking prominent liberal figures. The left could really learn something from her. This is why it is deserving of a high number of stars. More mature voters are willing to listen to your case if you don't scream and shout or even publish a book titled "so and so is a big fat idiot". Whatever their motivation, it seems the left has to resort to desperate measures of name calling  in order to get you to listen them. 

Charen backs up her claims with 20 pages of bibliography from credible sources. Whether you dislike her or not, you can't deny  is a very intelligent intellectual conservative woman with strong cases which she is able to back-up. This book requires you to take time and read thoroughly in order to grasp the many facts and cause and effect instances presented. 

Don't we all wish the country's liberal leaders would read "Do-Gooders" and see the effects of their social policy for the past 15 years or so covered in this book.  So-far no one has attempted to dispute the claims in it nor any facts stated.  This is a good read for someone tired of the constant pissing war involving the more publicize, late night talk show guest, controversial figures in the dirty games of politics in America.
