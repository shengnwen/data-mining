This is a quick and interesting read that uses a short story format to get the message, Extreme leadership - LEAP (Love, Energy, Audacity and Proof), across. In this format LEAP can be demonstrated rather than just discussed. Steve makes his case convincingly though I don't see myself following the path he lays out. This book is well worth reading and contemplating its message
