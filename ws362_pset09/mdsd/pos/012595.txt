This might just be because I saw the movie first. Or, it may not.
But I liked Alexander Paynes brilliant film a heckuva lot more than the book. First reason is Perrotta makes his characters seem like everyday people with flaws. This isn't my problem.
My problem is that the chracters are made out to be UGLY people.
Almost every detail he gives about the characters make them seem ugly. This isn't what human life is like. The MOVIE made the characters seem like people in a movie. Which, frankly is what I prefer. The book is interesting though, I just don't think it holds up next to the movie. The movie is told with a characters name as the heading on the title and their points of view.
Through this system of writing we meet Jim McCallister,Tracy Flick,Paul Warren,Tammy Warren,and Lisa Flannigan. McCallister or Mr.M is a teacher at a New Jersey High School. Tracy Flick
is a student who slept with her English teacher and is running for president of the student body. Paul is a jock that decides to run for president after Mr.M's pressuring(which i'll explain in a moment). Tammy is Paul's lesbian sister who decides to run after Paul (unknowingly) begins dating Tammy's "girlfriend".
And of course Lisa Flannigan is the girlfriend of Tammy. Now
Mr.M wants to derail Tracy's campaign due to a subconscious hatred of her overachieving and the fact that she slept with his best friend. So, he recruits Paul. Paul is kind of dumb, but he's popular so he seems like a perfect candidate. The rest i've explained above. Another problem I had with the book was the ending. The ending of the movie was a bit more believable then the end of the book. The notion in the movie of life kind of ending and then kicking back into gear is better than the notion of the book involving reconciliation with a few people rather than just one. But that's just me. B-. PS, I gave the movie an
