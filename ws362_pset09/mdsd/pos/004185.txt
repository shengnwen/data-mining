I like this book very much for several reasons.   However, a key element that I would like to focus on is the section on Internal Controls.  In some ways the role of a senior pastor is an impossible job.  When the new pastor is suddenly responsible to hire new staff, lead a building program, fend off a lawsuit and raise funds for new programs, he may wish for his seminary days again.

Many pastors have never had even an Introduction to Business Class.  They certainly never had time in their preparation to take an accounting class.  No matter how intelligent or how Godly the pastor is, he is vulnerable in the area of church finances.  When the church is unable to hire accountants, the business practices can be sloppy or non-existent.  Many times the person who will take some responsibility from us is seen as an answer to prayer.  Especially if it is in an area that we don't enjoy or don't understand very well.

In this book, Dr. Cirtin does a great job of stressing separation of duties.  The young pastor could save himself much embarrassment and perhaps his pastoral career by studying, understanding and implementing this section.  This book is straightforward and easy to understand.  There is in this small paper back guidelines to church finances that will allow the pastor to concentrate on being a pastor.  And while he is sharing truth from the Bible, his church will be practicing truth in the office.

This book is a lifeline for the small to medium sized churches that do not have the budget for an accountant or financial manager
