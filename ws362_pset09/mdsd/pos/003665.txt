I read Mishima's "The Sailor who fell from Grace with the Sea" years ago and while Sailor got rave reviews, I actually preferred this story.

Mishima masterfully weaves a simple love story that, despite its Japanese setting, is evocative of youthful love everywhere.  The sensitive protagonist is a hero the reader will root for from the first page; of course, it's partly a fairy tale we've read a thousand times before, where the peasant (fisher boy) falls in love with the prince/ss (bourgeois daughter).  There are no dragons slain in this tale, however, except those of personal dilemmas and our hero's inevitable rivals. 

A charming, heartwarming tale of unforgettable characters told with Mishima's trademark poetic simplicity
