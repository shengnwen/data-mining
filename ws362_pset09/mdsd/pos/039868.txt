I can't say enough about this beautiful book.  In fact, if I sound like I'm gushing, it's only because I'm completely in love with it.   Zolotow's prose is lovely and lyrical, and Vitale's illustrations are gorgeous--dynamic and colorful, with enormous attention to detail, whimsical, and engaging; the use of paint on wood makes them all the more unique and reinforces the nature themes of the story.  My two and a half year old son thoroughly enjoys looking at the many facets of each illustration.

To put it plainly, this is no dry exposition of the seasons and the earth's rotation--it is a gently spiritual book that uses the facts of ecology to point to the Eternal and, also indirectly, to the active benevolence of the Universe.  If the reader so desired, this book could be used as a springboard to discussions about reincarnation or the continuance of the Spirit.  Even leaving all that alone, this book makes a wonderful statement about the loveliness of nature and the impermanence of all states of being.  Plus, it reassures children that  bedtime and sleep are just as natural as morning and waking time, and just as important and lovely in the grand scheme of things.   Now THAT'S beautiful
