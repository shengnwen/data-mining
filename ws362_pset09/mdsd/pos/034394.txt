Children love this series If You Give....
As a teacher I love these books because I make my curriculum from them.   I read the story and the children can have fun trying to guess what's next.  After this story we made muffins.
In the If you give a Pig a Party we used wallpaper to do an art activity.  
There are so many activities that you can do and take from the story to make it more meaningful to the children
