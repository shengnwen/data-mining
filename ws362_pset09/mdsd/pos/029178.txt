This was my first novel written by Orhan Pamuk. From the beginning I was intrigued by the characters and their situations and angles.  All must interpret for themselves the secular versus radical Islam tensions in their own ways, and all must do so not knowing what it will mean for their futures, their families, and for Turkey. Each character will decide where to stand not knowing which way the country may tip or topple.

The main character, Kars, is a poet returning from Germany to view the city of Kars, a city caught in the possibly pre-civil war tensions of Islam versus Secularism. The city has also recently experienced a number of young women committing suicides, ostensibly over head scarves, and whether to wear or not to wear.

Ka is a powerful lens from which to view this world predicament. He stops to write poems throughout the novel, reminding readers of the need to pause to reflect upon such tensions, both personal and political. His growing love for Ipek further increases Ka's need to understand his homeland and his future and his real beliefs, in a way, in a sense, that many characters in many novels never have to.

All this is presented by Pamuk's craft, known for its wondrous weaving and detail. I am now looking for a nother novel by this gifted writer
