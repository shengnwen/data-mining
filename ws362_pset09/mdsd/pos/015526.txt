I have liked using this book with my 7th grade part-time home-schooled son.  It's much more interesting than the school science text on related subjects.  The pictures are especially great; probably much prettier than looking at the real thing through a microscope.  I would prefer to use a microscope; but since we don't own one, this has been a good visual and informaitonal resource
