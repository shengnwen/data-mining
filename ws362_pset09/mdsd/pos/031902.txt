Jon Weiner's book is a goldmine for all those interested in Lennon's political phase which he actively was involved in after his departure from England to the States. His underground friends and allies like Jerry Rubin, David Peel, Michael X and a host of others star in this novel which takes us down the streets of New York with a political Lennon voicing his concerns and opinions on a host of issues not related to his world of music. Though the style is not very evolved, Weiner's book is indispensible for any serious study of John Lennon's political inclinations
