  When I was much younger I stumbled across a book of his with mostly black and white reproductions. I instantly loved his ability of filling up a composition in odd but logical ways. This book shows most of Mr. Shahn's paintings in color. I consider him a subtle yet sometimes bold colorist. Especially those reds. Now i can fully marvel at his work. Also grab the book "Common man, mythic vision". By all means, also check out Jack levine, Philip Evergood, Rico Lebrun and the rest of the American Expressionists/ Social Realists. So they won't be forgotten in time
