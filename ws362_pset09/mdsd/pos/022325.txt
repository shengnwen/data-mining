As a long-time reader of spy novels, I will simply say this is the best, most literate, intricate, gripping, and yet emotionally moving I have ever read. A memorable read, luminous characters, international intrigue at its best. If it is true that the story is not based on actual events, as the author claims, I must say that McCarry has a brilliant gift for  plotting and quite an imagination. I was so engrossed with the characters that I felt like I knew them, that I was there as it happened. Anyway, it stuns me that this never became a best seller. This may be his best, as some say, but I am going to try the other novels. See you -- I'm going into deep cover with top Ameddican spy Paul Christopher..
