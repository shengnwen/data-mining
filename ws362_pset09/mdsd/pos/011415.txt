I'm about half way through the adoption process and am currently about half way through this book.  Although it is over 20 years old, the information is GREAT. It has aided me in some more questions to ask my social worker that I would not have thought about before - and should have.  I HIGHLY recommend this book for any one considering adoption of a child older than five.  It's right on the money as far as the process you need to go through, and questions you should ask
