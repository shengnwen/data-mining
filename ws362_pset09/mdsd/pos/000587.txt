It's been a while since I've had to write in Philosophy-Speak...I think I've forgotten how.  But let me speak plainly.  This is one of the few philosophical treatises that I've actually read cover-to-cover.  Kierkegaard is, by far, my favorite philosopher, and I tend to agree with most of what he has to say.  As a religious person, I agree with what he has to say.  The main proposition of this book is: Sin IS Anxiety, and the opposite of Anxiety (Sin) is Faith.  As an existentialist, we are all radically free (I know, Sartre's phrase) so when we despair (The Sickness Unto Death) we actually CHOOSE to feel that way.  Once we accept this, we can achieve serenity through Faith in God
