This audio book was one of those "that looks interesting" purchases. I knew nothing about the US Exploring Expedition before this, but after listening to this audiobook I found out that the expedition was more important to US history than most people realize. 
The story is facinating. The expedition was more of an afterthought and was launched almost on a whim. Under an inexperienced "captain", the six ships of the expedition sailed around the world, down to Antarctica twice, to the US west coast, back to the Philipines, and then all the way back to New York. They faced all manner of challenge, and still managed to carry out innumerable scientific experiements and bring back tons of artifacts and samples. The accomplishments of the expedition helped set the pace for the scientific efforts of the United States.

A note about the pace of the story; I'm not much a student of maritime matters, and was at a bit of a disadvantage. There are many references to sailing terminology, and this left me feeling lost at times. Also, I'm not a big fan of the narrator; he had a habit of making the dry parts almost dusty. Overall, the story of the US Ex Ex was one that I was happy to learn about, and I recommend this audiobook to any student of US history.
