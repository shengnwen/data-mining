Morgan Jones is an ex-BBC engineer - it shows! His techincal knowledge is excellent, his presentation is clear and easy to follow. Here's the big BUT - like the BBC - there is little creativity or 'daring' in his designs. His project is based on something he did 20-odd years ago and did not excite my imagination. A very good introduction (I enjoyed it immensely) but I think that Rainer zur Linde and Menno van der Veen have more to offer in extending thermionic technology
