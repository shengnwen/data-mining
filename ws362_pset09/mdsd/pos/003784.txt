This book was a real surprise. If you are at all interested in problems solving and why we all so often make poor decisons, this is the book for you. It uses the results of the author's psychology research using simulation models, where people are put into complex decision making situations and the quality of the result analysed. The book documents the specific factors that go into making good and poor decisions. It is very easy to find oportunities to use these ideas in both my personal and work life
