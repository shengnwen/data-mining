The plot really doesn't matter; they're all basically the same, whether it's Ian Fleming doing James Bond or the Executioner or Matt Helm. What places Spillane above the rest, and right up there up John MacDonald, is that he is a heck of a writer. He not only tells a good story, he is truly a stylish and natural writer. Had he gone in a different direction rather than Mike Hammer (which is no where as cool as name as Mickey Spillane) he could have produced some serious stuff that would have really lasted
