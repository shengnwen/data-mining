Although the author of this volume has a reputation for ponderous prose I did not find his writing style as forbidding as I feared it would be. With determination, one can quickly adjust and fall into line with the epic  tempo of the book. An extraordinary intellectual adventure awaits anyone  who has the fortitude and time to negotiate these pages which, I believe,  provide a clearer picture of the emergence of 21st century society and  culture than anything else that I have encountered on the subject
