This book, in conjunction with _Ishmael_, is the most important book I've ever read.  I recommend it to every open-minded person I come across.  These are the only 2 books I've read so far of Daniel Quinn's, but they are mindblowing (and I'd already had my mind blown by several books before!)

If everyone were reading and discussing these books, our world would be in much better shape.

Another book I'd recommend along with these is _The Continuum Concept_ by Jean Liedloff.  Read all 3 of these books over a long weekend, and you'll be a completely different person.  Guaranteed
