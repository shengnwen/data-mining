A year ago, I was forced to read this book by my english teacher... At first, looking at the cover, (it was red with a picture of a girl) I had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it... 

After a couple of days, i was surprised to see myself bringing the book everywhere I go... During break times, lunch, and spend 2 full hours reading it at home...

Reading this diary, made me picture how Anne had her teenage life.. It was really different from mine. Nothing beats how a 13 year old girl manage to live a life like a prisoner in the attic. No other friends to talk too... Same people she sees every single day... In a small place called the "Secret Annexe". 

Can you imagine that that kind of life? That you have no idea if you can eat or not, if you should talk or remain silent for the whole day... or if you can still get out of that Annex and live a normal life again... Can you imagine??? But still, they remained hopeful until the last air they breathe...

For me, those people are the real heroes. They never gave up. They sacrificed and united. And best of all, their faith in God reamined strong.

This book influenced millions and millions of people from all over the world. This is a real story of a real world... And the fact that this happens too to so many people. Sometimes we ask, "Why do we need to repeat History?" 

Read this book and you'll realize that this is different, worth it and remarkable...
