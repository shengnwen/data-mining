Having been a pre-med major, and the mother of a child with NF1 I am always interested in medical books.  This book is an absolute must read for anyone who has a serious illness or a family member with one.  It gives great insight not only to how doctors come to conclusions but how to cahllenge those conclusions.  Many of us forget that Doctors are only human and are therefore suceptible to the same mistakes all of us make.  Being a physician is a science but there is a large component of medicine involving intuition.  Those of us who know the patient best often have the best insight as to what is wrong.  For exmple, if my youngest son complains of pain, I know he is in serious pain whereas if my older son complains of pain, I know that he is a bit more dramatic and subsequently treat it as such.  Doctors do not always know the patient like family members do; this book teaches the reader how to bring their concerns to the forefront of the physician's mind.
