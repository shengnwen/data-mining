This book is thoroughly entertaining, and makes the reader completely  suspicious as to if anything they have ever seen in a museum is actually  authentic.   Thomas Hoving draws on his countless hours of investigation to  illuminate the reader as to the frequency of fakes.  Although he has  occasion to assume the reader knows more about art &amp; history than can  be normally expected, he does make you want to read more on the subject.   My next purchase will be &quot; Fake?&quot;. A good read that lacks enough  illustrations as to the subjects being discussd, it is equally valuable for  its bibliography and end notes if nothing else
