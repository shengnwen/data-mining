This is a great book for people that like to get their information quick and high level.  The writer is not a science geek so plain english is used for most of the book.  Also he uses comparisons to things that help get your mind wrapped around very complicated concepts.  A great book for people who want to have a better grasp of how much there is still to learn in the universe
