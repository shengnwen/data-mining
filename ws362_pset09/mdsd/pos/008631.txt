This is a fine fictional account of the Battle of Jutland. Jutland was the one major engagement between the British and German navies in World War I on 30 May, 1916. The clash involved hundreds of ships ranging from small destroyers to 30,000 ton battleships. During the battle the British learned of a major design flaw in their battle cruisers. These ships were lightly armored for speed but armed with large caliber main guns to match battleships. Unfortunately, the magazines were not properly protected from the turrets firing above them and the had a tendency to blowup and disintegrate the entire ship. Most of this novel takes place during the battle. The author gives excellent descriptions of the equipment, crews, tactics, and running and handling of the ships that participated in the action. The battle sequences are exciting and realistic. The main characters are Hugh Everard, Captain of a Queen Elizabeth class battleship. He is the mentor of his nephews, David and Nick. David is older than Nick and an experienced sailor assigned on a battle cruiser. The inexperienced Nick is newly assigned to a Destroyer. Each of these three men are severely tested during the battle. This is the first novel in the Everard saga and well worth the read, but be warned: these novels can be addictive
