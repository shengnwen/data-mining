These CD's are great--I love his technique of building upon words and phrases.  It is a bit annoying to hear him talk--he is kind of slow and having to listen to the other two people who are repeating the answers make mistakes and ask questions is kind of a waste of time, but all in all, I feel more comfortable with sentences now.

These CD's only cover the present tense. Still, a bargain at this price.
