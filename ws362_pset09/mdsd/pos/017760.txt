Polanyi challenges the Neoclassical (specifically Hayekian) assertion that  humans started out as individuals , and only later grew into societies.   Siding with Durkheim and other holists, Polanyi argues that the concept of  a freely contracting economic individual is actually a very recent, and  very sociohistorically localized, assertion.  Put simply, &quot;free  markets&quot; are something consciously made and supported by societies,  not an a-priori order nor a state of nature.  Polanyi beautifully weaves  legal, economic, political, and social history into a cogent thread of  argument.  One doesn't have to oppose free markets upon accepting Polanyi's  argument; one just has to become aware of markets' socially constructed and  supported nature
