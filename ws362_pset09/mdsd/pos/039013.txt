Having read Anne Frasiers first novel I was impressed enough to give her a second try. This outing is far superior to her first book. I found her writing had matured and become deeper. She is able to weave an intricate set of stories and weave them all into one cohesive ending. I was caught up to the end as to who the 'real killer' of Cantrell's childhood friend was. (to be honest though, I never really try to figure it out, I don't want to ruin books the same way I ruin movies) I was left thinking that could it be her partner, sister, sisters friend? They all had motive. 

The communication between the characters was believable and real. They communicated like a normal dysfunctional family! I would love to see further development of any of the main characters of the book. Frasier has left herself with so many openings to new books. She could follow the sister, Cantrell or even Ivy Dunlop of her first book. I find it really interesting when an author refers to previous  book's characters. The  only other author who does this well is Lisa Gardner. You must read her books in order because otherwise the character references will be lost on you. They almost stand alone, but the references will tie them together. 

Sleep Tight is an excellent suspense novel with an intricate plot that weaves two separate but interesting stories together to a stunning climax. I can't wait to buy her next novel and see what Frasier can do next
