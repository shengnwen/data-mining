I liked reading this book here in America because it revealed that lesbians and gays exist in Ireland and that same-sex encounters in Ireland can be as exciting as anywhere else. The stories about our warrior past are as interesting as the present-day stories of life in Dublin. The writing is excellent and the book has beautiful graphic designs based on our Book of Kells. The stories are about pretty boys, drag queens, and the kind of leathermen and bears who belong to LUBE in Dublin. I'd appreciate a volume 2 for reading on my return trip
