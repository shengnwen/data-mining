Dr. House's book is one that should be on the shelf of every Sunday School teacher.  This survey is concise, helpful, easy to read, and it remains true to Scripture.  It will open the eyes of the one who has always wanted  to know more about the Old Testament but was too afraid to try on their  own. It leaves you wanting more, and it leaves you knowing where to find  more...the Old Testament itself
