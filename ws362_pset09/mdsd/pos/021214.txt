I shared this with my first graders today and all nineteen of them could barely sit still.  It is a beautiful book and the children absolutely loved it.  Robert Sabuda's TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS got the same reactions.  They are amazing books and I highly recommend them to other teachers, even up to third grade.  The children could not wait for me to turn the pages. In 16 years of teaching I've never had books that got reactions like these did!  I'm definitely ordering more.  The kids would never forgive me if I didn't
