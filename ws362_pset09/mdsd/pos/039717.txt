I read this book when I was 9 years old.  It was my favorite book when I was a kid, and I read it again and again.  When I was 20, I wrote a song inspired by this book.  A few years ago I managed to find a copy for sale (the one I had as a kid is long gone) and, of course, I bought it.  The copy I bought was from a 1969 edition, the same edition I had as a kid.  Almost hard to believe this book was originally published in 1942
