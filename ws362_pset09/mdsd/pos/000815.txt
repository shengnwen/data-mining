My daughter is 5 and we've just finished reading this book together.  I love this book on so many levels that I have trouble putting words down.  Funke (or Funke's translator, not sure which) delivers a page-turning, compelling story about adventure, friendship, loyalty and doing the right thing.  She does all of this amid perfect sentence structure, flawless grammar, strong character development, larger than life imagery and unparalleled story telling.  I have not a single complaint about this book other than it's not long enough!  Oh how we both long for more!  I read this book to my daughter for an hour each night at bedtime (remember, she's only 5) and usually an hour each day.  There were many wonderful opportunities for discussion about lessons in the book and new vocabulary for my daughter.  There are no truly "bad guys" in this book (aside from Nettlebrand whose life is borrowed anyway) and those who made some poor decisions are given opportunities to redeem themselves in the end.  The characters are so strong and lovable!  I can't say enough about this book.  I do hope someone will take on the task of putting it to the big screen.  It will be a veritable feast for the eyes.
