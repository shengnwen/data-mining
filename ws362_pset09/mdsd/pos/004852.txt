This is one of Bentley's best because it dwells on an aspect of human behavior not often explored in such a horrific way. He adds some elements of horror that may confuse some readers, but these add to the weirdness of the story. Kept me going til the end which was one of his best I wasnt disappointed. Lots of ways to get stuff by writing letters I never even imagined and lots of ways to use letter writing for evil. Read it, you'll like it
