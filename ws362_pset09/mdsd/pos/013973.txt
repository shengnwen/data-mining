This book is a good book to read. This book deals with people real problems, and real life road blocks. There is a girl who is over weight, there is a guy name Brendan that is gay. There are many more people invovled, but I'm not giving that away. Then all of the people have to go to a class call "Alt ED." They have to go to this class because they have done somthing in the past that they have to  make up the consequences. And that is all the information I'm going to give out!!
