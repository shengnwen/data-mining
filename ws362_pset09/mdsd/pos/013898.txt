I got "she comes first" for my husband 3 weeks before I bought this book.  She comes first is one of the best book purchases ever.  Based on that, I bought this book.  It has some good info on the psychological side of a man's sexual needs, and a few tips and techniques for women.  It was a little dry, and I felt the focus kept coming back to me, the woman.  It is a very nonjudgmental book, and is very reassuring.  It does not expect some amazing bedroom act, rather it shows you how your own emotional tendencies are found in him, and how to satisfy them.  It is a simple book with simple techniques that are extremely effective.  I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK, AND IT'S EVEN BETTER IF YOU GET "SHE COMES FIRST" WITH IT.  My husband has turned into a different person since this book, and I am loving it
