I recommend this book for several reasons.  First off, it is extremely well-written.  There's no rambling, it's very well researched, and the way the stories and facts are expressed are not dry at all.  The writer, Randall Sullivan, writes for Rolling Stone magazine, so it's presented in that style.  Even if you aren't interested in the Tupac/Biggie story, this book still goes deep into the origins of the Bloods and Crips, East coast and West coast rap feuds, and especially, just how corrupt the LAPD was(and probably still is).  I've read other books on these subjects, including the recently released book by "hip-hop cop" Derrick Parker, but this book is by far the best.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed
