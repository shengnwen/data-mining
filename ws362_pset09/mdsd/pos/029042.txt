Poor Mr. Peszke.  What he really could have used from his publisher was a good editor and a good proof reader.  The book has numberous typos and grammatical errors, all of which are inexcusable and no fault of the author's.  The writing is a bit clumsy in spots, and could have used a bit more &quot;punching up&quot; and tightening, which a good editor would have provided.  These faults notwitstanding, Mr. Peszke is to be highly commended for a very well research and well structured presentation of a fascinating aspect of WWII.  I would still recommend this book, as I found the subject matter well presented and was kept interested and engaged throughout.  The only interuptions were when the aforementioned typos and editorial vacuums emerged, and where I found myself thinking &quot;that's unfortunate, as Pescke's effort and subject matter deserve better.&quot
