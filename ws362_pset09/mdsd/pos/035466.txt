This book was passed onto me in a box that a friend didn't feel like packing.  I'm always skeptical of national book club choices, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.

Obviously, you can read above for the book summary.  That being said, I felt I was able to get to know all the members of the Morrison family through Lawson's writing, even if the story was narrated entirely by Kate.  The story jumps back and forth between the past and the present, but isn't difficult to follow.  

My only complaint is that the story ended before I ever learned if Matt and Kate truly reconnected.  It seems the author was on her way to resolving this issue, and then the book simply ended, an issue I've encountered in much of my reading lately
