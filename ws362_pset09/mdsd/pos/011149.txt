The Complete Guide to Freshwater Fishing fits my bill very nicely.  The book is divided into neat chapters on gear, rigging, and the common types of freshwater fish found in North American lakes and streams.

Each of the "fish chapters" (trout, bass, pike, etc.) has an impressive discourse on the fish itself, its habits, habitation, and how and where to best catch them.

The gear and tackle chapters teach all one needs to know about the different types of bait, lures, flies, knot-tying and other mechanics of the sport which are necessary if one is going to do more than catch sunnies with bread-balls.

Well written in short, clear prose, the book  is fabulously illustrated with color pictures, charts, graphs, maps and other visuals which really explain both fish and fishing.

This is an excellent guide for both new and experienced fresh water fishers.
