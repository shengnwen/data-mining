This eclectic collection of writing was loaned to me by a friend who thought it would be right up my alley.  She was right!  I had never heard of the series and am now seeking out the other years of "Nonrequired Reading."  Every selection is different, so you are bound to love something in here.  Several entries had me giggling delightedly.  Others had me crying.  Most I just enjoyed without any sloppy emotionalism.  Definitely recommended
