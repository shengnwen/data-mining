How do you write a novel about wife-battering without making the batterer a monster? How do you write one while making sure the reader cannot blame the victim for staying? Well, perhaps the first is impossible, but the second surely isn't, and this book is proof.

Doyle takes us inside the head of Paula, who has found out that her deadbeat husband is now dead. There are hints that she might have had to something to do with his demise, but it's not clearly drawn out until we have learned how horrible he has made this woman's life. Why doesn't she leave, some may ask? Well, she's poor, not well-educated, and has grown up in a family and neighborhood where abuse stays behind closed doors. However, her struggles first to survive her husband, and then to survive the memories are moving and poignant.

Doyle also lets us the effects of abuse on the children, who have witnessed it, and how the whole family can act in accordance to keep the unsavory behavior of one of their own a secret. While Paula considers herself weak and just muddling through, the reader will likely come to the opposite conclusion.
Rather than go on Oprah and confess her problems, she keeps her struggles to herself (and the reader) and in doing so, comes across as incredibly brave, a heroine in every sense.
