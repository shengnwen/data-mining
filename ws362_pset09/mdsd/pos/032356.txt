This book is so interesting on so many different levels. It talks about people who are autistic and the way their brains work differently from non-autistic people and it talks about the similarities in the ways that autistic people and animals brains work and process information. Written by an autistic woman who fills the text with lots of first hand experience she really helped me to understand animals on a whole new level. I'm not much of a reader of non-fiction, but this book is so interesting. You'll learn a lot. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in trying something new. Very good and worth the money
