This book begins with a rather alarming single sentence paragraph, "We are losing." What the authors are referring to is their belief that we are losing the war on terrorism because of the faulty strategy adopted by the administration of President George W. Bush. They contend that this administration has failed to understand both the nature of Islamic extremism and the terrorist movement(s)this extremism has generated. They agree that if truly democratic governments can be established in the countries of the Near East it would be a major deterrent to terrorism, but are much more pessimistic about the ability of the U.S. to do this than the Bush Administration. They join the growing chorus of critics who claim that Operation Iraqi Freedom has done more to encourage than to discourage the spread of Terrorist ideology.  While this is a contentious argument, they provide a good deal of evidence to support their claim. They also debunk the claim that the terrorist movement al Qaeda is a state sponsored terrorist organization like Hezbollah. More importantly, the authors offer an alternative strategy which appears to be grounded in a much better understanding of both the terrorist movement and the vulnerabilities of the U.S. and Western Europe to terrorist attacks. The alternative strategy they propose is, in part, drawn from the partially successful strategy the U.S. used in Afghanistan and in part drawn a more realistic assessment of the terrorist threat to the U.S. and Europe.

A word of caution, both authors served on the National Security Council under President Clinton so they are hardly disinterested commentators on the present administration. Yet, I believe that on the whole they present an accurate picture of how America's Global War on Terrorism has failed and why. Their proposed strategy for this war makes a lot better sense to this reviewer than the Bush administration's present strategy.
