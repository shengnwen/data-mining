I got away from my vegetarian diet about five years ago... major move, lots of stress.  I tried to start back up a few times, but all the cookbooks I had or could find had recipes that were too time consuming to pull off and still feed the other non-vegetarian members of the household.  This book has delicious recipes that take minimal time to prepare and have relatively few ingredients.  A great buy
