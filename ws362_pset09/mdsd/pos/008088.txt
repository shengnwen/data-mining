What a lovely novel. Ms. Whetstone has a gift for letting her characters make the story rather than just her putting pen to paper. Her books seem to write themselves. Her characters are just that; characters. The story of Herbie and Noon is a touching one, but devoid of all romance. And although that was hardly the focus of the novel, it lingers. There are many tragic heroes and sheroes in this novel and the author's ability to tie them all together with one thread to one woman who can help them all is fantastic. Excellent story. Excellent writing.
