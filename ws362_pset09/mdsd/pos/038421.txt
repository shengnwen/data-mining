I particularly like the writing style: not only presenting a story, but with fine description of the details, the surroundings, the atmostphere, the characters, etc.  That tends to drag you into the story rather than listening to a story on the outside.  The story itself is attractive too, with wizards, evil gods, etc., much like the old Conan stories in the 80s.  The drawback is that is there's a little difference in Conan's personality from the Conan I was familiar with in the 80s
