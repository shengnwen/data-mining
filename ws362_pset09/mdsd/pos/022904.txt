I liked this book for many reasons, but one of the reasons I appreciated &quot;You're Not Stupid&quot; is it provided me with so much information without making me feel overwhelmed. Although I think of myself as being well informed, I discovered new and important information reading this book. In fact, the book's description of Bush's education "reform" in Texas is fascinating . . . in a tragic train wreck sort of way. 
 Bottom line, this book is a fast easy read and by the time you finish, you will know more about our President than your neighbors, your co-workers or your friends
