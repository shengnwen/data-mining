Two people wander the earth after an unspecified apocalypse, struggling to survive in a world of complete anarchy. Cities are cesspools and troops of "pirates" reign unchecked. While not as good as Pat Frank's "Alas, Babylon" this is still an entertaining read, although definitely not for younger readers with its gritty violence and rape. The ending is somewhat unsatisfying as well with the fate of Thea and Evan left unresolved
