This is the first of Flynn's books I've read, but it certainly will not be the last!  Former CIA insider turned author Vince Flynn holds nothing back, and after reading Executive Power I feel like I  myself was the spy and government assasin.  I've read other thriller novels by other authors, but NONE has ever matched the level of authenticity, reality, and gritty detail.   

Our main charector, Mitch Rapp, is a top level CIA agent who's main job is ending the lives of real nasty people.  He's a real old-shool, hard line, no-nonsense kind of adventurist with little tollerance for self inflating politicians who have no idea what life is like on the front lines.  In fact, if this book has one flaw (note I said IF) it's that Rapp is a little too super human.  But hey, considering how much fun the entire experience was, I'm more then willing to suspend my disbelief and accept Rapp for the hero that Flynn wants him to be.

Bottom line:  If you are looking for an author who can give you a fantastic, thrilling, insider spy-thriller ride, then look no further.  Vince Flynn is your man
