Just brilliant, I read it in his Spanish version 7 years ago; hey I was at that time a freshman student and had no knowledge of a lot of things. I just did not stop in every detail, and let me assure you, it is not necessary to comprehend the whole story. Don't bother having dictionaries and stuff, just follow the story bypassing the details.

3 years ago I read it for the second time, I found a lot more things than the first time, it was quite refreshing

now I have studied a little of Kabbalah and felt the need to read it again, it is amazing how much you learn when you read the book carefully, but hey, don't do it the first time, you don't have to and if you are not intellectually patient and curious you will certainly get bored of stopping again and again
