I loved this book.  The fun in this book is not really in the mystery or setting but in the humor.  The book is very sly in making fun of it's narrators.  It's told through primary sources, so you have to read closely to catch all the mockery.  I found it laugh out loud funny and the ending is one of the most twisted and hilarious denouements in my recent memory
