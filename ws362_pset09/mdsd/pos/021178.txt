I am a seventh grader from Seattle, and I read the Red Kayak by Priscilla Cummings. I thought it was a good book and I thought I would share my opinion. 

It is about a 13-year old named Brady who leads a normal life as a working kid fishing for crabs when a new family, who is quite well off comes into the neighborhood. Tragedy strikes when their red kayak turns over in the bay and causes a tragic accident. Brady, who is on the rescue team and friendly with the family, investigates the cause of the accident, and he doesn't like what he finds.

This book is full of suspense and will keep you hooked from page 1 through the end of the story. It is a very interesting book and I think I would recommend it for people ages 10 and up. I give it four and a half out of 5 stars. It is a must read.
