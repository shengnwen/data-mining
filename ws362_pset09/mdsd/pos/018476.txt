This book is a powerful tool. I was at my wit's end with my teenagers when a friend gave me this book.  It changed my thinking about prayer and helped me to focus the prayers on specifics, using scripture.   I saw a change immediately.  I cannot control my children, and thanks to the advice in this book, I no longer try.  I leave it up to the One who is in control.  I give this book to all my friends who are parents, whether new or old.
