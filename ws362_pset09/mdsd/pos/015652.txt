Im mostly writting this review to counteract the insipid and less than insightfull review posted by Robert J. Hickey "yogibob". The plot and stoy flow quite well and the action is fun. I found the end to be a bit rushed. As to why Im cammenting on Robert J. Hickey "yogibob"'s review is because his main complaint was about forgetting the laws of physics. *sigh* This is a FANTASY NOVEL Robert J. Hickey "yogibob" . Why not foster your willing suspension of disbelief and enjoy yourself for a change. Must be tough to walk around with that much of a stick up your butt.
