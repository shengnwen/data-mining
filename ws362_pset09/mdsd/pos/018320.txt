  As the authors proclaim, this is a book lover's guide. But not everyone will share their tastes.

  The authors do present one hundred short, informative and entertaining essays on the books they have enjoyed, which they feel others will appreciate as well.

  I suspect I was not greatly impressed because I have read nearly all the books they recommend, some so many decades ago that I felt truly aged.

  Many of the suggestions are not -- as the authors admit -- one night reads by any definition.

  In some ways, I found the range of selections too broad, but that opinion probably reflects my personal tastes.

  Treated as a descriptive list of the authors' favorites, most readers will discover something they haven't seen or thought of before. The descriptions will certainly aid in choosing what you might want to read.
