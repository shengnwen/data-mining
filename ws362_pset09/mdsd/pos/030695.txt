As a former member of the US Psyops and Spec Ops community, I found this book to be both amazing and inspiring.  The language and diction of this book, sometimes ridiculed by those who have not been in the Army (obviously), reflects one has been in the Army and Special Ops.  The book is authentic and true, from what I know of the Army.  I found the part about SEAR school to be motivating, and the part about Stephanie Shugart's (wife of MOH winner Randy Shugart, who saved Durant), brought me to near tears and was extremely meaningful.  I was not the soldier that Durant was, but it still made me proud to be a soldier.  Furthermore, the book renewed my respect for the Rangers, Delta, and the Nightstalkers.   For those that doubt this book, maybe you ought to sit down and have some meaningful time with one of the members of one of these elite units
