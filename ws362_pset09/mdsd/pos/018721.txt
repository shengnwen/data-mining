SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FIND THIS BOOK &quot;BLAND&quot; BUT SUCH IS TRUE LIFE!  THE PEOPLE WRITTEN ABOUT IN THIS BOOK ARE MY GGG-GRANDPARENTS, THE DE WIT'S.  EACH GENERATION PASSED DOWN THIS INFORMATION TO THE NEXT SO AS TO KEEP THE BOOK ALIVE.  IT'S AN ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF LIFE IN 17TH CENTURY HOLLAND AND THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN ARE SO ACUTELY DESCRIBED YOU CAN IMAGINE LIVING DURING THAT TIME.  IT'S FULL OF TURMOIL SORROUNDING THE POLITICAL NATURE OF THE DAY WITH REAL HEROISM.  IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO SAY I'M A DE WIT DESCENDANT
