Managing Generation Y is a wonderful guide for managing the newest population in the work force.  I personally am a young Generation X'er and could relate with most of the topics discussed.  Many of my friends and family members are apart of this new cohort.  My experiences with this generation align perfectly with the descriptions in this book.  I highly recommend Managing Generation Y for managers, supervisors, friends, and family members in contact with Y'ers.  For members of Generation Y, this book will surely lead you down a path of self discovery
