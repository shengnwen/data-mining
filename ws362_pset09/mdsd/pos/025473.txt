This book provides the best text-book style introduction to Applied Behavior Analysis there is.  The writing is straight-forward and well-organized.  The only thing one could wish for is a second edition, but in the foreword it states they promised their families that there woulnd't be one :)  That's ok, it provides all the groundwork one needs to read and understand the literature since then
