Classic revisionist study of how FDR maneuvered America, against the wishes of most of its citizens, into war against Germany and Japan, and how FDR's war policy ended in betrayal, disillusion and endless conflict. Establishes convincingly that U.S. participation in World War II was neither necessary, nor desirable, nor just. Edited by one of this century's most influential American scholars, this is a work in the front rank of American historical scholarship. Eleven concise, scintillating essays on every aspect of FDR's secret diplomatic and military warpath, by eight giants of revisionist scholarship, including H. E. Barnes, Charles C. Tansill, F. R. Sanborn, W. L. Neumann, G. Morgenstern, Percy L. Graves, Wm. H. Chamberlin, and G. A. Lundberg. A measured and relentless expos of the calculated deceit by which FDR overturned America's traditional neutrality policy, provoked Pearl Harbor, and waged a brutal, pointless war that culminated in mass slaughter at Dresden and Hiroshima, and betrayal -- of America and the West -- at Yalta and Potsdam. These are incisive, unmistakably American perspectives on how the US made a mockery of its own professed ideals during the "Good War." A virtual encyclopedia -- authoritative and comprehensive -- on the real causes and the actual results of America's entry into the Second World War. Indispensable as a history and a reference. Highly relevant for an understanding of how the United States came to its present-day policy of "New World Order" global military adventurism
