Gay's message is simply this, after the grim analysis of where we are and how we got here.

Jesus.

Put Jesus front and center, and remarkable things happen. No Jesus, and all the programs and initiatives and capital campaigns just hiss away like a red hot needle dropped in the Baltic Sea.

Jesus at the center, and even old (years since establishment of the congregation) churches can show growth and vitality. Keep Jesus in the china cupboard, and even a new start in a cool `burb with lots of drums and praise choruses can go bust.

You really oughta check this one out.  Full disclosure:  i'm a friend of hers, and read drafts, and she put the best of her gifts to work assembling this; it isn't just a grant-fulfillment obligation or quick review of data.  It's a message to the churches, to those who have ears to hear.

Lenten blessings,
Jef
