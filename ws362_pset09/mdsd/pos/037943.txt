Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is a beautiful story about understanding and appreciating others, and having belief in ourselves. If one really tries, they can find negativity in any story. Focus on the important lessons of faith, hope and charity Rudolph's story embodies and it will bring a little light into your life. Merry Christmas to all
