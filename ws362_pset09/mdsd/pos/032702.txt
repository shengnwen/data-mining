Anna and Sir Phillip Gordon looked happily unpon the upcoming birth of their child, hoping against hope to have a boy, even going so far as to only pick out a boy's name.  When the child arrives, Anna is dispirited when she gives birth to a girl.  Sir Phillip makes the most of it, but still decides to give her the name they'd already chosen: Stephen.  And so enters into the world one of the most astonishing creatures of literary fiction.

Young Stephen knows that she's different from the other children, but her father, noticing her difference also, allows her to grow up her own way: riding horses like a young man, sometimes dressing like a young boy.  From a young age to her lae thirties, we watch as Stephen discovers herself, longing to love and to fit into a society that will not accept her or others like her.  She puts her feelings into words, becoming a successful author and does find love, but that love is put to the test when someone who can offer her beloved acceptance steps into the picture.

An astonishing book for its time that was banned upon initial publication, openly discussing what was considered taboo with much candor and respect.  The characters of Radclyffe Hall's novel deal with the same societal pressures and beliefs which are still prevalent today: same-sex marriage, societal roles of male and female, wanting to fight for one's country during a time of war even when that country doesn't want you because of who you are.  A truly remarkbale novel
