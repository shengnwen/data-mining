Part way through the book, I paused and thought about these messed-up lives and unexpressed emotions, then it occurred to me that these guys are just like everyone I know.  To me, this is why I found the voices so authentic.  I am Vince's age and shared his attitude toward those of his father's generation.  There is little narration and much stream of conscious thinking which makes the book, at times, hard to follow.  Develop a score card of characters and relationships early since it does get confusing.  Ultimately the four stars are for the implicit language which limits the scope of the book somewhat.  Although the dialog is onviously authentic, I know that I missed some things since I am not from the neighborhood and the dialog almost assumes that a reader must be from nearby
