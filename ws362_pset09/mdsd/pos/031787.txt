Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The characters are easy to relate to and the story goes full circle to weave each of the characters into each other's lives. 
This is the first book I've ready by Jane Green and it has convinced me to try her other books.  That's a good thing as I usually have a hard time getting "into" a book, but this one was easy to catch onto immediately.
