A lot of books are available about Precolumbian civilizations, especially mesoamerican; Aztecs and Mayas are the most learned of all. BUT, we read always the same informations for a long time. Inga CLENDINNEN gives us  &quot;An Interpretation&quot; : what kind of civilization has rizen on the  plateau of Mexico-Tenochtitlan ? How to explain Aztecs's power in a region  where so many people had developped cities and values such as Olmecs (in  TEOTIHUACAN) or Toltecs (in TULA) ? We discover first the City and its  meaning. Then, we enter the mentality of the peoples who entertain LIFE by  their Death (the Victims), their Work (Warriors, Priests, Merchant) or  their personal place in the society (Males, Wives, Mothers). Third, we  enter the Sacred and we begin to understand how the Rituals may consolidate  the society with the Fear of others... before being the plea of a revolt of  vassal populations. AZTECS were strong by their military organization but  weak by their believes : an entire world fearing the sun could not been  able to born another day, organizing war to provide their temples with  victims to their Gods, such a world had to find its limits. When the  Spaniards came with their &quot;magic&quot;... Aztecs resist, but only two  years. The Death of the Empire is to find in its structures self. The same,  with other contexts, explains the fall of the Ancient Indian Worlds, facing  the Spaniards, the French or the Englishmen. Understanding how to be strong  meant to become weak, for Native Americans old civilizations, may permit  the Renaissance of New Indian worlds; but here, I go beyond the  Interpretation of the Author. The Book tells us how to enter in Aztecs  Civilization Construction, as we visit an Architecture, a Mecanism...  Thanks to Inga CLENDINNEN for this initiation (please, excuse the bad  english of a natural french writer)
