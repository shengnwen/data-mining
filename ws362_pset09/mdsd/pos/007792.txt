In the first quarter or so of this book, I was afraid I had been duped.  I found myself grumbling about how the definition of "thriller" had changed over the last 90 years.  Then, somehow, mysteriously, I fell under Buchan's and Hannay's spell.  I realized what a wonderful period piece this book is, and how well it captures the tense situation of the Great War.  Furthermore, Buchan's writing has true literary value -- he was extremely well grounded in classical literature, English literature, and the Bible, and they all shine forth in this book.  This thriller of Buchan's has deserved to stand the test of time.  Now, ask yourself, do you really think that will be true of Tom Clancy
