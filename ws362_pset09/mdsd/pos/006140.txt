History is not always what one reads in encyclopedias or text books.  To understand what actually happened it is important to hear the accounts of those who were actually there, almost all of them merely by circumstance. What is interesting is that frequently when one hears the accounts of others who were present at the same event their perspective of everything changes.  It is clear in this instance that each of the people interviewed subsequently realized that they were victims of deception.  Some readers may be confused that people may give different descriptions of the same event.  However, for anyone that has ever observed witnesses in the court process, different perspectives may often be given within hours of an event.  It is similar to the three blind men describing an elephant.  For me, some of the differences in the observations give the accounts more credibility.  Some differences can never be resolved but the picture is clear that the truth about the death of JFK is far different than what one may read in official government reports. William Law has written an important book.  For anyone who cares about the truth of what happened on November 22, 1963, this is a must for their library
