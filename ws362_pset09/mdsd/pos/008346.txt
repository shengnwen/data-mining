A great book in many ways - Andrew Pham succeeds in creating a seemingly straightforward memoir that is actually several subtle things skillfully weaved together:  a travel narrative, a fight for personal independence, an investigation of one's ethnic roots (which partially arises from a great deal of meditation over one's own family history).  Pham shifts between these eclectic elements with great skill, creating what is both a great Vietnamese story and a very classic sort of American one.

Pham's own family history is detailed at great length, and I like his tone through all of it; anyone who has ever come out of a self-aware and hard-working, but also highly dysfunctional family will instantly see a bit of themselves here.  In writing about his own family, the mix of pride and defiance, set against a willingness to confront others on their b.s. makes for both an admirable self-portrait, and some very sharp writing.

His writing about Vietnam - his travels from Saigon to Hanoi were mostly done on a bike - is the product of the same tough clarity of vision:  a love of people, place and culture is always there, but Pham can't see the place as exotic, and is no roots fetishist in spite of his interest in history - thus we are presented with a detailed, warts-and-all portrayal that - as with his comments about America - essentially demands that you see a place, and it's inhabitants exactly as they are.

His writing about his own siblings, and his relationship with them, is perhaps best - tender, baffled, smart and hopeful even when confronted by tragedies.
