The O'Malley series supposably comes to a close in this book. I got to know Stephen O'Malley in the last chapter of The Healer and knew he was running. Running from God and Jennifer's death. His old friend, Meghan Delhart, is blind and has things that are randomly missing. An earring, some money. She finds a fabulous ring in her piano metronome and realizes the old kind jewelry dealer, who is deceased, Neil, might have a lot of secrets hidden under a loved name. Stephen is trying to find out who is doing this operation of jewelry theft and conterfeit. But, a perilous ending will have you on the edge. 

I enjoyed this book, but one of the hardest aspects to overcome was adapting to reading the views of a blind person. I had to focus and visualize her black world, which was fairly difficult. This book gained my respect as I learned how challenging the blind have it. 

Good Wrap Up to the Series Ms. Henderson. (Though I don't believe you're finished with the series quite yet!
