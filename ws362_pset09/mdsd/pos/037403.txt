Pensacola Junior College has used Effective Communication for Colleges in our Business Communications class for several years.  This textbook includes just exactly what we need to enable our students to communicate  effectively both orally and in writing.  The emphasis on grammar review is  highly relevant and well constructed.  The examples shown are timely and  appealing to our students.  Supplementary materials are helpful and easy to  access.  Keep up the good work
