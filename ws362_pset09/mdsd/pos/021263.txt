This books title says it all SIMPLY beautiful sweaters. It has 2 things that are essential to the new knitter. 1. Full sweater laid out so you can actually see the end result top to bottom, unlike many pattern books where you only see a small part of the sweater or the model is in a position so you don't get the full effect. 2. Actual pattern piece measured at each area, so no wondering about the final fit. 
This book has been a favorite of my new knitting friends because they are always pleased with the final product, no surprises and for first sweaters, the directions are very clear. I have been knitting for over 20 years and I use this book more than any other. I can take the basic pattern shapes, change a few things, add cables etc and design my own sweater that I am sure will fit when finished. By far some of the best basics availible...RECOMMENDED for all knitters.
