If you liked Killer Angels, you'll enjoy this book, too.  While I found the book's 570 pages a bit long, I also found myself dreading that the book would soon be over as I neared the end.
I found the book to get better as it went along.  It actually turns into a real page turner as the Feds are racing to cut off the Conferderates as they try to escape from Virginia at the end of the war.  I found the author's account of Chamberlain to be especially interesting.  Of course, we all know the end of the story, but it is enjoyable to read the accounts again.
