Considering the rapid changes of fashion in the 20th century, this is an ambitious work that largely succeeds. Shame on Amazon for listing Christian  Lacroix as photographer. Lacroix only wrote the preface! The book is NOT a  photograph collection; it is all Peacock's artwork. His choices are  probably better in the earlier years. In the later decades he tends to  feature extremes rather than standard wear. I remember the 50s on and never  saw in real life some of the things he depicts. Still it's a beautiful  book! His renderings are charming. He draws the clothing very well (not so  good with hands and feet and his heads vary wildly in size but I niggle)
