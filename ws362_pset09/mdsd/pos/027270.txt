I just finished this book and it was great!

I read it on my pump breaks at work (funny, huh) and it was easy to read and pickup/put down many times.  The language was intelligent but not so textbook as to be boring of difficult to sort through.

I would recommend this book to all nursing moms. It starts with history and cultural beliefs, moves onto biology and benefits then talks about formula companies and their dirty tactics. 

Very well rounded view of breastfeeding.
