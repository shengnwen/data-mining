This is a GREAT book.  I have ridden on most of the trails, from Arrowhead, Big Bear to the Anza Borrego Dersert.  With variety this wide, you can ride all year long, deserts in the winter, mountains in the summer.  I have recommended this book to many other people who have purchased it and ridden with them on these trails and they have followed the book and gone on rides by themselves.
If you 4-wheel it or ride motorcycles make sure that you get a street legal motorcycle and buy this book.
