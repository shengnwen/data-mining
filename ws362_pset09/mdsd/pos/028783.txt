I only gave this book 4 stars because I had a tough time getting into it.  I'm not sure if it was my frame of mind or the writing itself, but the chapters leading up to the departure of the Grosvenor were confusing and I had to reread quite a bit as I went along.  However, the further I got into it, the better it became, and at the end I was sorry it was over.  The story of the wreck of the Grosvenor is fascinating and Taylor's research and storytelling ability is remarkable.  And though the fate of the women is unknown, I finished the book with a feeling of hope that they fared better than most of their shipmates.  I was sad that some of the truly goodhearted people didn't make it through, but that's the gift of a good writer - the characters were real to me.
