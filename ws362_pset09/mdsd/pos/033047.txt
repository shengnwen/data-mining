Berenson's classic study of Italian Renaissance painters is well worth  seeking in used bookstores or through book-finding services. This  collection of essays separately published between 1894 and 1907 focuses on  the painters of Venice, Florence, central Italy, and north Italy. In  intelligent, lively prose, the author not only analyzes the merit of scores  of individual painters from Giotto to Correggio but also traces the  development of Italian painting and constantly reiterates his theory that  the &quot;life enhancement&quot; qualities of of high art are found in the  areas of tactile values, movement, and spatial composition, all of which he  explains in articulate detail. Movement and energy, for example, can be  expressed in an arm leaning on a pillow. He correctly identifies the  partnership in Florence between an intense desire for knowledge that helps  to explain and control the world and the &quot;discovery&quot; of classical  forms from ancient Rome. In painting, this led above all to a focus on the  human figure (which Berenson claims as the ultimate subject of art) and a  preeminent dedication to line. The intellectual rigor of Florence  contrasted with Venice, the voluptuous capital of a wealthy mercantile  empire distinguished by public rituals, where spectacle and color were the  chief aims of art. Berenson's authority ranges through landscape, the uses  of antiquity, Illustration and Decoration, prettiness versus beauty, and  archaic art, whose appeal lies in its search for form and movement. The  book is sparsely illustrated, so you will have to supplement it with your  own visual sources, but it's a goldmine of information, useful  perspectives, and thought-provoking opinions
