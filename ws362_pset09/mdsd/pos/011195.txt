Like a pleasant tropical breeze, "Our Man in Havana" ambles in. It's the kind of story that would seem easy to write until you actually sat down to write it. Only then would you realize just how difficult it is to marry genuine comedy with legitimate suspense in a quick couple hundred pages.

Jim Wormold is a vacuum clean salesman who's recruited as a British spy by the soi-disant paragon of British espionage Henry Hawthorne. I won't say what happens next, but you'd be right in assuming that in the always faithful comedic tradition of mistaken identity, someone has to keep spinning more elaborate tales in order to keep up the ruse. What really gives the book its kick is the sharp dialogue and effortless writing. At first, it appears Wormold's daughter Milly will provide the vital backbone of the book. Her precocious wit and dubious Catholic faith make for some interesting exchanges early on, but Greene steers his story away from this domestic turmoil and onto a grander stage. I didn't know if it would work, but two-thirds the way through, when I was turning pages without realizing it, I suddenly realized it had. I'd bought the idea that a vacuum cleaner salesman was in the process of fundamentally changing the world order.

"Our Man in Havana" is no "The Heart of the Matter" (Greene's "Legacy Book"), but like the tropical world it inhabits succeeds on almost every level it tries to, and that, more than a perpetually frowning pen, is the hallmark of every great writer.
