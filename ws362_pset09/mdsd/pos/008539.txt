VERY FAST read.  Worth reading. Less is more.
A few points that stood out to me are as follows;
*Remember to have a Lifestyle of worship(thanks/joy) and wellness, and how to do that.
*Reminder that the awareness of an influence/situation reduces its power over you.
*The first 6 paragraphs of chapter 1!!!
And among many other little reminder nuggets, one paragraph stood out.  It was a excerpt from another book by a Joan Bodner titled Taking Charge of Our Lives-Living Responsibly in a Troubled World, which I'll have to check out sometime.  It summed up MUCH DATA in a simple paragraph on how the corrupt world system works.  It starts with the sentence..."If the world were a global village of 100 people,..."  
WORTH READING!  Remember, TIME is your greatest asset.
