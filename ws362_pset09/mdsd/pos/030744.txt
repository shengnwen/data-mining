"KAFFIR" I learned while reading this well-written book, translates to mean "INFIDEL".  It's an Arabic word, not African.

"Kaffir Boy" is a very heartwarming yet simultaneously a heartbreaking true saga of a little mischievous, inquisitive little boy who grows up in the slums of Alexandra, South Africa.  He witnesses and feels the atrocities perpetrated by the apartheid system upon him and his family.  He survives the cruel and callous hardships of being very poor, the pangs of hunger, dilapidated shacks he knows as home and the fear of being left alone to fend for himself and his siblings if his parents are arrested because they don't possess the "proper" identification to the authorities in the midst of night.  Inwardly, he doesn't surrender to this systemic, unjust way of life and proves it by fearlessly participating in the June, 1976 Soweto student uprising that tragically ended in many deaths courtesy of the South African Police.
Yet he survives all the hardships and earns an oppty. to come to America and to continue to realize his dream.

I'm nearly the same age as Mark Mathabane, but I've never heard of him.  I may be wrong but I don't think he has spoken publicly at symposiums or seminars about the apartheid situation he left in the late 70's in South Africa.  I never read about his plight in magazines, newspapers, or even seen him play in tennis matches.

I'm happy for him but I think he should have been a little more vocal like the other black athletes such as:  Jim Brown, Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Arthur Ashe.  America has its share of racial inequities also, and I'm sure he experienced it while here.

Apartheid, in my opinion, still exists throughout the world although it has been benignly "swept under the table".
