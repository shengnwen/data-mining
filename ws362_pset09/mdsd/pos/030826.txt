The first in Alan Furst's series of novels about ordinary people caught up in  intrigues and espionage before and during WWII, NIGHT SOLDIERS is one of the longest of these books and often characterized as one of the best. The canvas is truly immense, encompassing village life in Bulgaria, France, and Bessarabia, not to mention Moscow, Seville, Madrid, Paris, New York, Prague, Budapest, and even life along the Danube. At the same time, Furst's command of fine historical and character detail is precise and thorough; it seems literally incredible that he knows so much about so many countries during a time in which he never lived. There are times when the novel becomes as berserk as a Hieronymous Bosch painting, given that there's not much really to tie everything together other than the central character of Khristo Stoiaev, a Bulgarian recruited to spy for the NKVD, the Maquis, and finally the OSS; the early sequences involving Khristo's training in the USSR are a bit dreary, and the final sequence along the Danube does seem to wear on quite a bit. The middle sections of the novel in revolutionary Spain, Paris on the eve of invasion, and the French countryside during the Occupation are absolutely engrossing, however, making the novel as a whole difficult to put down. I recommend this especially for readers interested in what it was like for non-military combatants to survive the second World War
