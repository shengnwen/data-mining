The terrible thing about Berrys/Parasuramans book is that, altough it first has been published almost a decade ago, its message on the meaning and the importance of service hasnt become more widespread. Why should you  read this book? - Good ideas for new (meaning: not commonly known and  accepted) service ideas. - Useful checklists - Altough scientifically based  the book is still easy and fun reading - Very good section on  complaint-managemen
