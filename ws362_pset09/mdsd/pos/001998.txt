I read this book two years ago and I liked it, but I thought I'd forget it soon.  However, some of the simple but pure phrases and scenes have stayed with me since then.  I don't know why, but I remember Maroo's making tea, her grandmother about to sacrifice herself for the community good, her trek over the cold mountains with the dog and her special fire.  The more I think about this book, the more I remember how much I enjoyed it.  Because it's not long and has simple language, you may think it's a quick read, but it's actually well-researched, interesting and stays with you
