I studied this book in high school as part of my background research into colonialism and &quot;American&quot; life before the revolution.  I have always been fond of history and wars so I possess a great deal more  motivation to read a book of such immense proportions.  The size is  intimidating and unfortunately seems to discourage continued research from  the layman reader because of the detail into which it ventures, which is  the only reason I marked it down one star.  On the whole, though, I found  it to be an enjoyable experience for use in finding out key facets of  history that typically are not focused on.  Obviously, as a high schooler  and even after I graduated I have not come close to reading all of the  almost-700 pages of material.  Nonetheless, what I have read offered a  great insight into the lives of the time.  Historians today dehumanize our  heritage into simple fact and fiction, myth and reality while playing out  the major occurences of the past.  Voyagers to the West instead focuses on  people as they struggle through trial and tribulation to acheive a goal  that is never deemed to be necessarily &quot;American,&quot; but is still  something special as anyone who has ever desired something can relate to.   This book goes into great detail, possibly too much for the common,  semi-interested reader, to explain and convey that history is built around  multitudes of &quot;the little people&quot; who forged ahead and  established a precedence through their actions that altered perceptions and  lives.  It tells the true battles of the Revolution.  Not battles situated  around guns and generals, but rathr around individuals who had to struggle  with more prominent enemies, themselves.  It is a wonderful and I say  necessary element of history to look at.  It might be more comforting if  the book was a bit smaller as the reader may feel compelled to move on from  lengthy passages; otherwise, the book is more than worth it
