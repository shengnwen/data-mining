I will admit first that I sped through the last 50 pages, as I was getting a little bored with the story by then, since I already knew how it would end. But for the other 90 percent of the book I found truly fascinating and a great read!

I had no problems understanding which events and themes were real and which were fiction.  I was suprised that the author could be so sure that the marriage between Catalina and Arthur was in fact consumated, but I didn't take her word for it anyway.  The blend of fact, fiction, and assumption is what makes historical novels so wonderful. 

Catalina/Katherine's battle to understand whether she was to despise/destroy or accept those of different faiths was especially interesting to me, and it seemed especially relevant right now, as Muslims, Christians, and Jews fight once again based age old prejudices and differences. There are some great parrallels to current events that I could not help but to see. Of course, I don't know how the author could possibly know if this was something that Catalina often pondered, but I thought it was a brilliant tie-in for the story.
