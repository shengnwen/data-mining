I found this book very readable and extremely helpful.  I have two middle school children in two different middle schools, and I learned a lot from reading this book.  It is based on research, and the authors make excellent recommendations for parents at the end of each chapter.  Although I'd heard about bullying and mean comments occassionally, I had no idea how common this is for today's middle and high school kids.  After reading this book I spent some time talking to my kids, both about being bullied and why kids act like bullies.  Having read this book, I was a lot more comfortable having the conversation, and I think my kids realized that I understood some of their experiences. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is concerned about their own child, or who wants to help change the environment within a school. (in fact, I wanted to make more specific comments, but I've already loaned this book to a friend whose son is being bullied!)I am also planning to give a copy to the guidance counselor at my daughter's school.  After reading this, I realize that just having &quot;BULLY FREE &quot; signs up at school is not enough; and I have some ideas about what we could do to make things better.  This book was a real wake-up call for me, and I highly recommend it
