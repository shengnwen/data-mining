Three childhood friends from a Boston working class neighborhood, who lost their innocence through a tragic shared occurrence, are forced together again as adults when one of their daughters is murdered.  Each is wrapped tightly into the investigation, but each must also unwrap themselves in order come to terms with this latest tragedy and its conclusion.

An exceptional book.  
A powerhouse story so well written, that Mr. Lehane's words allow you to slip unseen into these charters lives and walk around with them for a while (which is not very pleasant during some events).

Although the story is essentially a murder mystery, the real gems are the characters.  The charters are so well thought out and contain so many layers, that it is a joy to experience these layers being peeled like an onion to reveal their true nature.  In fact, the actual mystery (or "who done it") is almost secondary to how the main characters will be affected by each action and layer being revealed.  Of course the "who done it" is pivotal, but when the killer is revealed, the gas tank has already exploded and no conclusion could justify the actions taken.

A story about survival and awakening, with a hell of a mystery to push it along.  It was awesome.
