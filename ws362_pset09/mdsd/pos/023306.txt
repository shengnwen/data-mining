Roberta Bragg proves once again why she is one of the top Windows Security experts in the world. Unlike most publications that pop out whenever a product "upgrade" by the all-mighty Microsoft empire is released, this text encompasses all product flavors and other MS offerings. I do agree with a previous reviewer that it could've been made better by including 'real world' applications, delving in a bit more on heterogeneous environments where MS products may dominate the architecture, would've been extremely helpful. But, then again, the book is for hardening Windows systems, not hardening network infrastructure (you'll need Wesley Noonan's book for that - a good one as well). Overall, a great book containing tons of immediate solutions for your Microsoft systems, a definite must-buy
