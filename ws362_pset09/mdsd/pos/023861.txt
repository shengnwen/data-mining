There are so many things we take for granted, including care for our children and each other.  We would spend thousands of dollars on training, learning, and loving our pets but we failed to do the same for our children  and for each other.  Our children have more negelected love then what our  pets have received.  This book is a great wake up call for everybody.  It  has been a great tool for me to learn more on how to love and care for  anyone I come in contact
