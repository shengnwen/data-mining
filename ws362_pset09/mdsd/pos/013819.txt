If you enjoyed the movie, you're going to like the book better.  There was a lot to the story that Conn was forced to edit out of the movie to shorten the running time.  Once you read the book, you wish that Conn could have afforded to keep the movie the length she intended.  The book also explains some things that seem disjointed in the movie.  Claire's struggle to decide what exactly it is she wants in her life is interesting.  Noel's reluctance to get involved with a &quot;straight&quot; woman is understandable.  The story isn't as much about seduction as it it inevitability.  It would be nice to have a follow up to see how this pair ended up later
