I've never reviewed a book on Amazon before, but I really want to recommend this one. If you're headed toward the tenure track, or are even thinking about it, you should read this book. It's served as a nice counterpoint to all the advice books I've been reading lately. While those other books have been really helpful to me, this one's helpful in a different way--it shows rather than tells. It also helps remind me that things don't always come off well, despite our best intentions, and it's all too easy to ignore/forget good advice under pressure. Academic life is not all that it's cracked up to be, it can be a real grind, but it's still got plenty to recommend it, and Lang's painfully honest account reminds me to count my blessings. A bad academic job is better than many good non-academic ones. I'm recommending "Life on the Tenure Track" to my fellow grad students, and also to undergrads who have romantic aspirations for the professoriate
