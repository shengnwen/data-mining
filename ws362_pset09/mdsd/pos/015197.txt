I bought the book by mistake since I was looking for a more physical introduction to fluid mechanics. However, once I started reading, I could not stop. The book is a pleasure to read. Every concept is explained crystal clear. No single step is skipped. Almost every concept is illustrated with one or more very detailed solved examples. It is frequent in most technical books to find how the level of clarity degrades progressively as you approach the end of the book. This is not the case. Every chapter up to the very end is carefully arranged and the level is maintained.

The book requires very little physical background since every topic starts from the very begging. The huge number of topics covered and easy reading makes it ideal for undergraduate students. The accompanying CD provides a browsable e-version of the book, more problems, some advanced topics and an extensive list of videos illustrating the book material.

The book follows a full engineering and practical approach. If what you are looking for is a more theoretical work or a more strict physical approach, you will better look somewhere else
