I loved this book, Jungle adventrues are fun and this one was great. If you want an escape then read this book. I had one problem with something in the end (SPOILER AHEAD) When they knocked out the big bad hunter they didnt take the gun he dropped, they just ran and left him. The threat should have ended there. Other than that it was a fun adventure and of course somewhat educational book.
