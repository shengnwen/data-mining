A woman goes into a seizure induced by strychnine in her coffee in the middle of the night. The only problem? Strychnine is extremly fast acting, and the woman drank her coffee more than three hours earlier. So thus, Hercule Poirot, the eccentric Belgian detective with little grey cells is on the case. Christie's first novel is good, although definitly not her best. It still has some serious flair, and the late Dame knew how to pull the wool over her reader's eyes. The dialouge has a few flaws, as does locations and enviroment, but the plot is air tight. Fun and fast, this is a prime example of Agatha Christie.
