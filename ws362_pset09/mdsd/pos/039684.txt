There were things I really liked about Cover of Night. The characterization was sharp, the pacing was excellent, the motivations were logical, but somehow it failed to come together and engage me. It read like a book adaptation of a movie. I never invested in the emotional life of the characters, even as I respected their situation and the reactions they had to events. The major plot point required a massive suspension of disbelief. One thing I greatly appreciated was that the suspense was without horror elements. Too many romantic suspense books of late have relied heavily on graphic and almost sexual descriptions of violence, especially violence against children. Early in the book you learn the heroine has twin boys. Right away I'm bracing myself for yet another 'children in extreme peril' storyline. I should have trusted the author more. Worth a paperback purchase, certainly. As a hardcover I'd think twice.
