This is a love story about Ruby and Jack, two simple people who appreciate the kindness that the other has to offer. There is no great passion between Ruby and Jack, and their lives are quite ordinary and middle (if not "lower middle") class. Ruby is a heavy smoker, a habit that she picked up from her abusive first husband. Jack is a quiet and uneducated man who likes Ruby's bad cooking. When Ruby is diagnosed with lung cancer, Jack's whole world falls apart. Perhaps a psychologist would label the two as "co-dependent." In fact, Ruby and Jack have discovered the key ingredient that makes every good marriage work: Ruby takes care of Jack's needs, and Jack takes care of Ruby's needs. They give eachother comfort and strength, and it is a heartbreak when Ruby dies and leaves her aging husband to fend for himself. The alternating first person perspective works quite well, and the book is enjoyable. Why 4 stars and not 5? Like one reader, I must admit that there was a certain spark missing from this book.
