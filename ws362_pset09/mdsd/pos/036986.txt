This book deals with the exciting lives of two doctors and their ill daughter, who move to a new community only to find a dead body in their new house and a town full of secrets.  This was a extremely interesting book, with intricate details and an exciting plot.  The only drawback to the book was the length.  Although the book remained exciting throughout the book, the end could have been tightened to remove unneccesary and sometimes boring information.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the medical field, or anyone who enjoys a good murder mystery
