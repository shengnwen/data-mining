Other reviewers have given the plot already.  This novel thrilled me in a way that few Americans do (Louis Begley, Cynthia Ozick and the late Susan Sontag excepted).  Not that American writers don't thrill but just not in this way. Yehoshua's writing style is not an American style and why should it be--he is Israeli.  But still this particular way of writing--the accumulation of tiny details, the expansion sentence by sentence of each thought, like diagramming sentences only diagramming the idea of anything in its smallest bits.  A sentence.  The next sentence can go anywhere--up down sideways.  The writer chooses and we have the next sentence.  Again it can go anywhere.  It is all connected and of a piece but it is continual surprise on a sentence level, not a paragraph or page level which is how most writing gets written.  I suppose it comes down to the difference between literature and what falls below.

I think of Saramago, Kafka, Calvino.  And having read Hillel Halkin's translations of many many books his work needs to be prominently mentioned.  He is wonderful.  

And the counterbalance to the brilliance of the writing is a fascinating contemporary story
