As I have come to expect from a major DK publication, we get a very handsomely illustrated book at a good price. This book immediately makes one think of its "predecessor", if you will: the "Larousse Encyclopedia of the Animal World". I thought this new DK book would be a kind of updated replacement, but it turns out, no way! As another reviewer noted, this DK book is way lopsided in that it seems to be "starring" the mammals, and the further you get from that form, the less coverage. The Larousse book and this one are about equal in size, but the coverage is about opposite: the Larousse book devotes 270 pages to invertebrates, which in this DK book get a measly 76 pages! The Larousse book has a bigger section on fish too, and then it gets into smaller sections with the rest of the chordata. Anyway. I'm glad I have both books, to get some balance. If you want to find a brief profile on a particular beast (especially mammalian), this DK book is better. The Larousse book has more discussion (with photos & illustrations), not so much individual coverage.
