I had already heard the audio version of this book.  My 20 year old grandson was interested in what I said about the book, so I ordered a copy to be sent to him.  I look forward to further discussions with him and more audio books by this author.  I am legally blind, and can no longer read.  The audio books are so stimulating and welcome
