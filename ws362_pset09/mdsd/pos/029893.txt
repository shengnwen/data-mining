Richard Clarke's book, Against all Enemies, is, in the words of the author "flawed." It is a first person narrative about Clarke's service regarding America's counter-terrorism policies and tactics during the Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton and Bush Jr. administrations.

Because it is a personal account of events, there is naturally some bias on the part of the author most obviously seen in his overall approval of the Clinton administration and disapproval of the other three. However, if potential readers (regardless of political orientation) look past this, they will find a fascinating account of American clandestine foriegn policy regarding terrorism.

Clarke provides a fast paced, interesting summary of the causes and effects of critical events and foriegn policy decisions beginning, briefly, with the 9/11 attacks before moving on to an analysis of the Reagan administration and its involvement with Lebanon, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, continuing through the Bush Sr. and Clinton presidencies and ending with the current Bush administration and it's march to war with Iraq in 2003.

Overall, Against all Enemies is an excellent book and highly recomended for anyone seeking to learn more about America's counter-terrorism efforts of the past three decades
