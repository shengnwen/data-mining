ALthough a fan of Nora Roberts, I had avoided these books due to a dislike for romance writer's sci fi, however, I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised.  Should have trusted Nora's writing ability.  This book is by far the best of the series that I've read so far.  It is in the style of Dame Christie, and if you love her work you'll enjoy this futuristic take on the genre.  One caveat, Nora or her publishers should really take the time to put in the front cover or on the back of the book a spoiler warning as this book gives away the ending to Witness for the Prosecution and Murder on the Orient Express.  Yes these stories are famous and a lot of people have read them, but not everybody.  Be coureous to those young readers who might read Robb before Christie and have two great stories spoiled
