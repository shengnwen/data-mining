What can I say about this book???  It was fantasic, superb, a wonderful if sometimes disturbing read.  Anne Tyler captures so well the devastating effects that the lack of love and security and connection in our family can have on us for the rest of our lives.  Her characters are so troubled and so unable to really live in the world, always desperately wanting the family they didn't have, always afraid and isolated from real human connection, detached from their own feelings.  The three children, for all their flaws, are enormously sympathetic -- for how were they to know how to live, how to feel, how to connect, when they were raised by a woman who is so incredibly isolated and rigid and, perhaps, incapable of real love??  I had little feeling or sympathy for their mother, Pearl, which is one of the best aspects of Anne Tyler's novels -- her characters are not universally likeable and sometimes -- most of the time -- they don't redeem themselves in the end.  Like real life, there isn't always a neat little happy ending
