I am a Miniature enthusiast and have searched for a Cross Stitch book of Miniatures for years.  When I received this book, I was pleasantly surprised.  The patterns are easy to follow and easily adaptable to my color scheme.  A wide range of styles and I have enjoyed making each of the projects in this book and encourage other Miniature enthusiast to try it
