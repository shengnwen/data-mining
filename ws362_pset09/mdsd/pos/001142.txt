The author provides excellent information as to why commercial foods are not the healthiest diet for your dog. She also gave me the confidence to try this as I am not comfortable in the kitchen. Making meals for my dogs took some of the pressure off since I knew they would like everything I made! Plus, the recipes are very easy, though the prep work is time-consuming if you're not an experienced cook.

Unfortunately, after several weeks of spending all of our free time in the kitchen or grocery store, my husband and I decided that we simply couldn't keep up since we had to cook for four large dogs (ranging from 45 lbs.-80 lbs.). In order to do this, one of us would've had to quit our full-time job or make a career out of it like the author (she runs a dog catering business) to justify all the time and money spent.

If you have one large dog, or multiple small dogs, and you have the time and inclination to do this, then I would highly recommend Barker's Grub. Otherwise, you can make these meals just for special times such as birthdays, obedience school graduation and holidays, which is what we plan to do.
