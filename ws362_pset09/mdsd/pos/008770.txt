For a 150-page manuscript, this book has some great ideas about business transformation by being "remarkable". Its case studies are relevant and based on real challenges by some known companies. I like the concept of being "remarkable" but this idea, as Godin sees it, may not be easily achieved especially by small businesses. I however strongly agree that entrepreneurs should pursue the "purple cow" from the very start to at least guarantee some marketing edge
