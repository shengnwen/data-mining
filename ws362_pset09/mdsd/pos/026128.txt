This book supposes a unique quirk in the history of World War II, particularly concerning events at the Yalta Conference. I found the first two-thirds of the book extremely interesting, with well-drawn characters and a mysterious plot concerning spies and attempted assassinations. My problem with the book came towards the end, when the auther unleshed his "surprise" twist to the story. It was just so unbelieveable that I almost laughed at what was supposed to be a very dramatic moment. Accepting the action the author had begun, I finished the book, but that shock really did temper my enthusiasm for the book as a whole. That's really too bad, for Mr. Kerr is an excellent writer, and I thoroughly enjoyed his Berlin Noir trilogy
