I am a teacher of gifted and talented students. The title of this book invites reading, as creativity is something we all seek in so many different ways. CREATIVE UTOPIA is a sincere and honest conversation with the author. Theo William's book (~ on paper that is silk to your fingers and its print, graphics, pictures, and color soothing for reading and calming to the soul) differs from many books of its nature. In many self help books, you read and read, and if you are lucky, you might find some advice in the last chapter. In CREATIVE UTOPIA, you learn and rediscover a potpourri of strategies from the first to last chapter that stimulates creativity. Theo opens your mind to different forms of creativity, some familiar, some not. If a reader wants more information, a plethora of popular resources Theo  Williams has researched is offered - making just the bibliography she includes for each topic - alone - the best reason to purchase this book! Although the book is intended for a graphic design artist, I recommend this book to anyone seeking creativity and needing that extra boost of encouragement to realize creative potential. CREATIVE UTOPIA makes a great gift to yourself or a friend. Its quick read leaves you more time for your own unique creative powers. I have referred back for advice in this book of information repeatedly, especially the chapters on Fateful Encounters, Feng Shui, and Seeing Color Differently. In today's need for realization and simplicity, CREATIVE UTOPIA is my serendipity
