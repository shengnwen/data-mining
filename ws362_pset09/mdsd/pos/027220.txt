Gosh, what a treat this book is!  I love reading about each chef's approach to food, and I love to know where they eat and why.  This surpasses a tool like Zagat's because these people really know how to rate a place.  They aren't bowled over by presentation alone, they really know what quality food is and they appreciate it wherever they find it.  I live in a very small place with one fine dining establishment and not many good places to eat otherwise, so I can hardly wait to get out of town and try some of the places that I've read about
