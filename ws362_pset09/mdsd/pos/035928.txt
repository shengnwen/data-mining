Spalding Gray's suicide robbed us of our finest raconteur. His monologues were funny as hell, but they were also deep and thought-provoking at the same time. He is missed.

"Monster in a Box" is my favorite of Spalding's monologues- even better than "Swimming to Cambodia", in my opinion. I think with this one he really hit his stride
