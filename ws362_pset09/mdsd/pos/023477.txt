I would make this required reading for all potential leaders. Moore is not anti-war, but not pro-war, either; he recognizes it needs to happen, but he wants us to see it in detail. The first two thirds of this book are factual descriptions of the battles at Ia Drang in 1965, intelligently using monologues by those involved for paragraphs and even pages at a time. It is the battle through the words of those who were there, and in its detail and portrayal of context it is not only highly accurate but charged with a vivid sense of what the experience must have been like. After this, the authors speak on the political context of the battle, and then follow the families of American dead afterwards. To read that chapter takes a bit of determination. Gen Westmoreland gets lampooned and Chinese intervention get mentioned in the wrap-up after that, which is as tightly written as the rest, and includes criticism of American political methods and aims in the war. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history
