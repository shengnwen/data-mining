I heard about the writer during the Nextbook.org book readings in Chicago.  I have never read any of Malamud's work previously.  Curious to learn about how he perceived life of immigrants, Jewish underclass and life struggles in general, I have decided to read his complete collection of short stories.  It was pure delight to read these short stories not only because of their intense content, bu also because it gave complete insight of the Malamud's growth as a writer.  One can see how his writing and style is changing and evolving over time.  It becomes better and better with writer's personal maturity.  I would stongly recommend this writer to anyone who wants to read about Jewish culture, learn about life of immigrants in the period between 1930s-1960s.  Now I am looking forward to read Malamud's other work
