This was an absolutely incredible book.  I was impressed beyond words by it, but then again, I'm impressed by pretty much everything Jo Napoli has written.  I didn't read this book until I was (I think) about 12 or so, and it might be too much for little kids to handle.  But overall, the themes surrounding love, hope, and redemption are amazing.  I would definitely suggest this to anyone.  Well done, Ms. Napoli
