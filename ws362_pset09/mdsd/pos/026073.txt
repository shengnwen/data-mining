John Man's done a great job of sequencing the historic events in a way that captures the attention of the reader. I must however hasten to add that not all the events have been asserted as facts leaving some scope for reader's fantasy. John tends to hop back and forth between decades and centuries at some points where in he tries to place the reader in an appropriate context to best understand and appreciate certain facets of Genghis's vision and life. That might leave the readers a little lost in time :) Over all a very well done book that leaves readers rather enlightened on the geopolitical dynamics of ancient Eurasia
