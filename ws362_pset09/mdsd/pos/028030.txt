I read The Things They Carried several years ago but just now got around to reading another of O'Brien's novels.  I liked them both so I have no reason for why I waited so long.  This book is excellent.  As a former soldier I found it incredibly easy to connect with O'Brien's characters.  I am much too young to have been even a thought during Vietnam but through O'Brien (and a few others) I almost feel like I was there.  If I Die . . is more than just an account of what the daily grind was like during the war.  It approaches more of the mundane details that aren't so mundane afterall--once you give them some serious thought.

Platoon is a great movie for the philosophical study of the American G.I. in Vietnam.  If I Die in a Combat Zone is the great book of a similar nature
