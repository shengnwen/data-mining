Simply put, this is the most helpful book on the technical side of theater I have ever read. Mr. Campbell is a rare individual. Although a technichian, he has written a sympathetic and yet extremely informative  book on lighting, sound, stage terminology, etc. The amount of really  usefull information in the book is astounding.  I am a high school drama  teacher, and I think this book should be in the library of every theater  teacher and theater student. No other book I've read so clearly explains  the essentials one needs to know about the technical craft of theater.  If  you are a person who doesn't want a book where the author is trying to show  what an expert he or she is and what an idiot you are, then Drew Campbell's  book is just for you.  He is an expert who understands his job is to help  those of us who aren't. Bravo for this book. I hope Mr. Campbell keeps  writing on theater. We can use his knowledge, wit, and empathy. Five stars  for this book,  and a few thrown in for the actor with glass in his butt  telling jokes on the way to the hospital. Thanks for a great book
