This was the second Michael Connelly book I've read (I also highly recommend "The Lincoln Lawyer")...I loved it and highly recommend it to pretty much anyone interested in a fabulous book that is: (1) fast paced; (2) brilliantly and flawlessly constructed; and (3) keeps you guessing until the very end! 

If you enjoy Nelson Demille, James Patterson, Steven King, Dan Brown, and David Baldacci you'll absolutely love "The Poet!"
