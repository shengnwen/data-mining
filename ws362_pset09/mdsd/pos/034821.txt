Two women left the army after sexual harassment proceedings, both are killed and ex Army MP Jack Reacher knew both of them. As a perfect psychological match, Reacher is arrested by the FBI, but is released when another woman is murdered. Now Reacher has to use his skills to clear his name, and to do the Army and FBI's work for them.
(This book is released as "Running Blind" in the US and as "The Visitor" in the UK.)

This book features a new twist in writing style - the author Lee Child lets the reader know about the thoughts of the killer in between! These parts are also quite interesting even if the reader does not get any useful hints towards the identity of the killer. In general the book is well written, Reacher is charismatic and intelligent as ever, the pace is great and I hardly could stop reading the book. Even if the identity of the killer is really a big surprise and took me completely off guard I am not quite convinced by it since I do not think it was completely logical and especially believable.

"The Visitor" is Lee Child's fourth book and to my opinion it is clearly better and more thrilling than his second and third novel ("Die Trying" + "Tripwire)". Unfortunately it does not reach the brilliance of his first book "Killing Floor". Therefore I could not rate it with the full 5 stars
