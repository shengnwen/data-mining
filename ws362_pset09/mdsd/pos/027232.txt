It is book for the lay man to understand the atomic bomb. I was really amazed by the size of the project, which never thought in the earlier stage of the project. It is really terrifying story to understand how much money is spend on this.I could understand the guts of Leslie Groves, the man who involved in spearheading this project.It is like a novel. Wonderful to read and amaze.I found that very less information about the scientific details
