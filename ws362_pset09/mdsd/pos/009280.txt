i got this book from the library because i saw it on a shelf right next to the checkout desk.  my first thought was "well, of course, kids need more sleep and if they are tired they will misbehave."  while i was reading the book, i kept having the same thought-- "this is all so obvious".  i kept reading mostly because it affirmed my goals to not overschedule my son and stress him out and to avoid TV.  but having read the book, i find i am constantly finding myself in real-life situations where i am enlightened by the writer's ideas.  many times, even though in theory i am a huge sleep and nap advocate, i realize that my son's behavior is a function of lack of sleep. and i prob. wouldn't have naturally come to that conclusion.  would recommend this book to all parents
