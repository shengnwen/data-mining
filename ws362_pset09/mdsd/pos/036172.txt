Is religion irrelevant to modern society?  Should we cast theism overboard?  I don't know, but I'm interested in the dialogue, and in this book, Dennett offers an interesting perspective on these and other questions about religion.
In this book, Dennett takes the idea of cultural evolution, that there are nonbiological things like language and belief systems that evolve similarly to genes, and applies it to religion, looking at its survival value for early humans and its role in the contemporary world.  Although unapologetically athiest, he doesn't come across as pushy or arrogant, and I believe that an open-minded person of any (or no) religious view could read this book and be enriched by it
