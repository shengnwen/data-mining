DBC Pierre's ManBooker Prize winning novel "Vernon God Little" would have grabbed me more if it had not been for the somewhat pedestrian plotting. Pierre is beautifully sarcastic and I love his characterisations and observations of people, but having a bit more of a story to hang them on would have curtailed my impatience.
That said, it's an extremely quirky piece of fiction and has taught be a lot of what I've always wanted to know about cursing. I want to share some of my favourite quotes with you, in no particular order.
"Parents succeed by managing the database of you dumbness and your slime, ready for combat."
"Famous Actors put toothpast under their eyes to help them cry. Did you know that? I'm just telling you for court, in case you look too impassive. You know how impassive you can look."
"A receptionist with spiky teeth and a voicebox made from bees trapped in tracing paper sits behind a desk in Dr. Goosens' waiting room."
"I end up watching these useless brown moths that thwack around the light in my cell, felty splinters torn from nighttime, lost and confused."
