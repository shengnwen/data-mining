I always feel suspicious of books that contain such sentences as----"The cook poured my second cup of coffee.  I had never been able to get him to leave the coffee pot on the table.  He seemed to feel that would lessen his  dignity."  The reason for my hesitation is the slightly wry humor aimed at  someone the speaker might have asked, but didn't.  However, on finishing  OLD MADAM YIN, I have to conclude that it has some excellent points.  I  chose to read it thinking that it was an autobiography or an edited life  story by an anthropologist.  No, it is more the story of contact between an  American hospital worker in pre-revolutionary China and a Chinese woman  from an upper class family of the old school, Old Madam Yin.  The Chinese  lady has no voice, the whole book being the summary of Ida Pruitt's  observations.  As she, the author, spoke Chinese and knew China well, we  find an interesting picture of a certain style of life, the manners and  innuendoes of a bygone age in Beijing, family dynamics before Mao.  It  makes for fascinating reading, a useful source of social history, and is a  book which makes you ponder how much of Chinese culture survives into the  present even if somewhat overshadowed by the decaying but still-powerful  Communist Party, the Internet, vast movements of labor, the cementing over  of vast areas, in a noisier age of nightclubs and cars.  I would guess a  lot does survive.  It seems to me that a reader who wants to know what  Chinese think would be wiser to look elsewhere, but if you are looking for  acute observations by an old-style American lady, this is definitely the  book.  At 129 pages of non-academic prose, you can read OLD MADAM YIN  quickly, but the atmosphere will remain with you for a long time
