This book is good with lots of great information, ideas and helpful advice. I would recommend reading in preperation for your bundle of joy! We bought it when my little boy was 8 months searching for some much needed sleep help, but this book wasn't a right fit for that. However, I wish I would have read the book much sooner b/c with Tracy's help and EASY daily structure I probably wouldn't have had the sleep mess on my hands that I did! So, I would recommend it, but I would recommend it EARLY. I will certainly reread it during my pregnancy with Baby #2
