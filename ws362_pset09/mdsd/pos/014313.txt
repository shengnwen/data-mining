I enjoyed this unique look at some of the players in the French Revolution.  Although it was sometimes difficult to keep all the characters straight, the character reference guide in the back of the book made it easy to catch up.  It also humanized characters like Robespierre and Danton who often are dehumanized in the text books.  I highly recommend this novel
