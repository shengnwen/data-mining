Jules Verne, the father of science fiction, made several predictions
that came true in this book.  The book is exciting from cover to cover.  
It deserves more credit than it seems to be getting.  It was written over
one hundred years ago.  I would recommend this book to any science fiction
fan.  Danny Fleming, author of How to Prove The Collatz Conjecture.
