Bukowksi worked well when given every writers dream: carte blanche to write whatever he felt like writing, only to have it reproduced by the LA FREE PRESS and on the streets in a week, being read by thousands. Bukowski himself writes of the magical feeling of having the freedom to write whatever he wanted and the sudden notoriety he aquired with his new exposure. This collection of stories, as opposed to the ones collected elsewhere, show Bukowski still experimenting with a variety of forms and these stories contain a marked  sense of surrealism and a  even a polemical political bent, something which Bukowski usually had little stomach for; he gets in a few good ones at the expense of the false prophets of the 60's countercultural scene, a much needed antidote to the disgusting mythologizing that has always accompanied the free-love generation.
