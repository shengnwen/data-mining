I haven't even finished reading this book yet, but I just have to say how fabulous it is. I have just started my youngster over fences and have found this guide invaluable already, with 25 exercises involving just ground poles, it is already well used. The exercises build up in difficulty so you are always making progress and at the same time having fun and educational schooling sessions with your horse. I think there is something for everyone, beginner to advanced. 
As a budget conscious rider training predominantly on my own, I have found these types of guides priceless (see my other reviews) and they have really helped me to formulate a schooling plan each week and our progress has been very rewarding. I noticed that other riders at the barn were using the poles I left out in the arena and so I started posting the excercises on the bulleting board each week - inspiring everyone and creating great feedback and support. I know this is a book I will get a lot of use out of
