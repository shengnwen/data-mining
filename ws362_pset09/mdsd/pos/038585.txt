The haiku in this wonderful book are profound. They made me think, cry, laugh and above all, feel. They go right to the heart.  it is packed with brilliant, original observations about life.

The author is a wise philosopher. He sees and thinks clearly and feels a lot.  Just 3 lines of his haiku contain observations that could take a 300 page book.

I'm going give The Open Gate to my friends and relatives. I haven't felt so touched by words since I first read Walden Pond or poems of Frost and Emily Dickinson.
