I recommend this book.  It's accessible, but Stross respects his readers enough that he doesn't write to the lowest common denominator.  I found the first half of the book absolutely fascinating - I couldn't put it down and I was glad for the five hours on the plane to grant me uninterrupted reading.  Many challenging conceptual extensions of today's bleeding edge - a real pleasure.  The next 30% of the book was a long setup for the last few pages, and I didn't enjoy the same sense of discovery as in the first half.  Frankly, the last 10% was a real challenge to finish, but the payoff is worth it
