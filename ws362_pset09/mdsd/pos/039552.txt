If you're looking for a clear explanation of computer crime, and how to prevent, investigate and prosecute it, there's no better place to start than this book.  It isn't a bleeding-edge technical manual for IT professionals looking for new ways to secure their systems, nor is it a technical investigation manual for law enforcement personnel.  Instead, the book delivers exactly what it claims to - an excellent introduction to and overview of the subject of computer crime, with an emphasis on helping IT and law enforcement professionals understand one another's priorities, capabilities and needs.  There is enough technical information, however, to make it worthwhile for those who already have some experience in this area.  As a cop and police instructor with a background in the IT field, I have read a number of books in this subject area.  This one tops the field.  It's not perfect (thus 4 stars, not 5), but it's certainly the best that I've found yet.  It's well worth investing in for both information security and law enforcement personnel.  In fact, I've ordered extra copies as Christmas gifts for friends who are in the business
