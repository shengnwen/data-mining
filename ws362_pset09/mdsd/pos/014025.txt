Ok..So, I HAD to read this for a graduate level elective course. For a political science student, I can say that this is a relatively easy read. Although, explanations of some of the international structures are almost farcical. The book progresses from ancient public health to contemporary which is quite interesting. With a caution, near the middle of the book some terms are not explained as easily, they are merely stated. This is a rather good book but if you are looking to understand American public health-you need an additional book. This book is very expensive, but at least it is filled with content
