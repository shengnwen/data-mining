I've read a number of Greene's novels, but this little travel book was equal to his other publications.  As usual, his attention to detail, people, and culture creates wonderful images that bring us right to the Liberia of the 1930s.  I shared the book with my sister who lived in Liberia for 27 yrs. and she was astonished at the accurate reporting.  His prose is the best I've read for a book devoted to travel experiences
