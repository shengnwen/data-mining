This story tells a well articulated synopsis at a look inside the life of what goes on in the war torn Lebanon of the 1980s. It also includes enough historical detail to help the reader understand dynamics (of factions) about what has led Lebanon to become what it is today. I reccomend it to anyone with a modicum of intrest in Middle East politics
