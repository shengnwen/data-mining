...this edition contains both the 1604 and 1616 editions of Dr. Faustus.  In all honestly, though, I don't entirely buy the notion that the former should automatically take precedence over the latter.  It's entirely  possible that the additions made to it were in fact Marlowe's own ideas  that were merely added by others.  And in any case, I would have to say  that, as a whole, the 1616 version is more coherent, with a lot of the  threads left hanging in the 1604 cleared up.  More is done with the clowns,  and the character on whom Faustus inflicts horns goes from an anonymous  &quot;knight&quot; to an actual character.  The 1604 does have some things  to be said for it (the bit about Christ's blood streaming in the firmament  has been inexcusably edited out of the 1616, f'rinstance, and there's a  brief scene at the end with the scholars that seems superfluous), but as a  whole I'd go with it rather than the 1604.  If I was going to put on a  production of the play, I'd combine the two as I saw fit.  Okay then
