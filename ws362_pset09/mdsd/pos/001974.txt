Easy to read and concise.  Can be read in about an hour.  Sets forth good recommendations and sample schedules that can be adjusted to suit individual needs.  Although title suggests success in seven days, book admits that all dogs are different and that the seven day period is to be viewed as a "foundation period." Gave it four stars because I would have liked a few more pages
