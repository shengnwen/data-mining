This book is great, don't get me wrong. I bought a copy and I didn't even want to put it down till I was done, because it offers a fresh and interesting look at an age-old industry. But the book leaves out lots of points that would be very helpful for anyone trying to learn about the industry. Want something that picks up the slack? Buy "The Music Business Bundle" by Ty Cohen along with this book
