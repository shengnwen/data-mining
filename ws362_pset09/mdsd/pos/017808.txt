If you like non-fiction work detailing the bravery and hardships of individual soldiers on a battle field, this book is for you.

This book describes the battle of around 450 man of the 1st battalion, 7th cavalry under the command of Then Lt. Col. Harold Moore, that were sent into the Ia Drang valley to hunt and kill enemy soldiers. They were unknowingly inserted in the middle of 3 north Vietnamese battalions with a combined force of 1600 well trained and aggressive soldiers that were in the area specifically looking to engage and kill American soldiers as a way to developing a methodology on how to fight the U.S. forces with their high tech planes and choppers. A second battle ensued only 3 days later and a few miles from the first battle, where a second U.S. battalion was again surrounded producing another savage battle with heavy casualty in both sides

These forces clashed in such a violent way that in time was gruesome and heartbreaking to read. These soldiers were put in a situation where surrender wasn't an option. Injured men were being executed on the spot by the north Vietnamese. They were left with the only option of fighting to the end trying to inflict as much casualties as possible to the enemy, therefore increasing their chances of survival or a least making sure their deaths came at a high price
