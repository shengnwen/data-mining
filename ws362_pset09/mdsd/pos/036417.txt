Great book, plenty of action and suspense!  Reads fast and very hard to put down (like Hunter's Bob Lee Swagger novels).  The plot is rather contrived, but overall believable.  My main beef is with the COL Dick Puller character, who I thought was the weakest character in the book (the Army should have left him retired-- he was, after all, retired in disgrace for a reason!). COL Puller never impressed me as being the great tactician the author intended.  Instead, he seemed rigid and outdated in his tactical approach to the battle scenario presented.  COL Puller simply "wasted" the Maryland guardsmen in a poorly planned and executed frontal assault against an entrenched enemy force without even trying to obtain basic pre-op intelligence (such as what might be under that "tarp" in front of the silo entrance).  Puller even implied the guardsmen were expendible at that stage of the operation, though better planning on his part might have achieved a more favorable outcome for them and the mission. Also, seems that Puller could have simply planned (even if only as his backup contingency) to blow up the MX missle when it exited the silo (missles aren't going very fast at that point of the launch sequence).  Better yet, he could have dismantled/destroyed the silo hangers directly to prevent a missle launching through them.  Destroying the missle or silo directly would have been easier than trying to fight his way to the launch capsule at the end of the elevator shaft, or trying to infiltrate a small team through an uncertain (erosion-created) tunnel network at the base of the mountain.  As it was, he never did have any such backup plan, should his "race against time" not succeed.  But Puller-quibbling aside, The Day Before Midnight was still a very suspenseful book, one well worth the read
