If by some unimaginible twist of fate, for some unspeakable crime, I were to be condemned to a small, desolate island for the rest of my life and allowed to carry with me but one book, the choice would be easy: Golden Gate by Vikram Seth.  It would be easy for the obvious: reading this book is so pleasurable it makes one feel guilty (as in "Oh god I don't deserve to be so happy!!").  It would be even easier for what is not so obvious: reading the book engenders in one an intense desire to try and re-create the sublime beauty of Seth's verse.  Such a pursuit is a futile exercise over many lifetimes -- one lifetime in a marooned island would go by in the blink of any eye
