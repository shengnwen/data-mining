Being a medical doctor, I was excited to read A Theory of Love by three M.D.s!  This book gives a great overview of development of our brain related to our very early environment and contact with other humans and does so in a very non-pretentious fashion.  The importance of providing a loving environment for our children is shown in terms of neuroanatomical development and while it may be somewhat over the heads of some non-medical readers, it is no more so than the movie"What the Bleep Do We Know?"  I think this book is a must for anyone with even a passing interest in the psychological makeup of ourselves and fellow beings.  It will help everyone to have a better understanding of ...this Thing Called Love
