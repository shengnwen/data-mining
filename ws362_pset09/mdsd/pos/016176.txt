This book (the cover amazon has displayed is *wrong*) is very interesting.  It is also exceedingly strange.  It was never boring, but it never made too much sense either.  You think there might be supernatural elements involved -- but maybe not.  It's a tale of the coming to America from England, the stuff that happens to the British here, and Indians.  Cool, confusing, book
