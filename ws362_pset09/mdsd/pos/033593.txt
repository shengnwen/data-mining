In this book, the narrator shares a part of his imprisonment experience in Siberia in the 1850s.

He describes the inmates in his barrack with remarkable perception and insight. Most importantly, he rises above the question of moral and character, resulting in a broader implication of his discoveries in the prison. There is a preoccupation with what it means to be human in conditions that constrict the full potential of man. The lack of homogeneity among the convicts, much less humankind in general, is paradoxical to the fact the man everywhere is essentially the same regardless of what social fetters are set on him. The destitute and the tender circumstances that mark a man's life only make him stronger and more desperate in violently reign in life to make it his own. 

Although the narrator's own moral framework is present, it is often overshadowed by his own curiosity to learn about the forces that make man who he is. His characters are without categories, without good or evil but they make you laugh bitterly, smile sardonically and hang on askance. Everyone's life has its complications but the most elusive kinds are those about human nature, the choices one takes, the unexplainable behaviors in man. While situations always resolve itself with time, human is quite an irresolvable puzzle. And all these you can find in a typical Dostoevsky's works, The House of the Dead is second only to Crime and Punishment.

For these reasons, this book is worth your time and money
