The Second Summer of the Sisterhood by Ann Brashares was one of the best sequels that I have read in a long time. It tells the story of the same adventurous 15 year old girls, Bridget,Carmen,Lena and Tibby as they go their supporate ways for the second time with their trusty traveling pants. Throughout the book, each of the girls bring in many important people to their lives in short sections of each chapter so that they can once again go through the summer without eachother's presence.

I liked the way that each of the girl's part was captivating and kept you reading wondering what would happen next. Ann Brashares herself loves to travel and wearing pants and her experience in traveling had helped her write these books.

Teenage girls will especially love this!
