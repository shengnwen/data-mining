First of all I think it is very important to remember this series is fictional, although based on scriptural truths.  
The writing is not the most outstanding, but it is an action series in a lot of ways.  I do not know how anyone who starts at the beginning of it all can walk away from this story.  It's compelling; I think the characters are realistic.  You find your self hating some and cheering for others it is a clear line between good and evil.  It is a fun series lighten up and enjoy it for what it is.  Good Clean Fiction.
