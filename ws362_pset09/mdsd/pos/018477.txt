I bought this book in 2002 when I was desperate for help. I have suffered from PMS all of my life and had extreme postpardum depression after giving birth to my child. I thought that I was going crazy until I read this book. Thanks to Dr. Sichel I sought out help and now know how to handle my next pregnancy-it won't be easy, but I will no longer be uninformed and ashamed! Thank you , thank you, thank you! You described exactly what I was going through
