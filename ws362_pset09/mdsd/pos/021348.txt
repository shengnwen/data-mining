It all begins on 1924. We have many characters which caught great attention to my eye.Let me start out by saying how much I liked this novel. It really caught my attention because it seems that Fitzgerald transported gatsby to the south of France. Dick Diver is a talented psychiatrist that has invited everyone to his mansion. "I want to give a really bad party. I mean it. I want to give a party where there's a brawl and a seduction and people going home with their feelings hurt and women passed out in the cabinet de toilette."Sounds just like Gatsby.
	We don't know Dicks' story yet and are left to make a judgement to what it was. The party all include many people, but of all there are three that are very significant. This whole idea that there'e to the novel is very confusing at times. Even though I may have liked the book alot, I think it's not directed to the audience I stand in. Fitzgerald compounded the book with many words that were unfamiliar to my understanding. Which required alot of searching in order to comprehend the novel. There's even some French in this novel. So if you're looking for a challenge and to enrich your vocab this would be a good book. Moving off that subject i need to state thate this novel is written in three different perspectives. Such that it's diveded in three books. It was a first to me, and i kind of liked that style. Moving back to subject, I would not recommend this book to others just because of the time it took to read it. I know it's a great book and all but many of my peers like to stick with t.v. Thereof its not one of my recomendation if you don,t like to read.Overall i give it a four out of five. 

P.s This book left alot of unanswered questions. Some like Who is the victim Dick or Nicole? Will either Nicole or Dick find happiness? See if you can figure them out
