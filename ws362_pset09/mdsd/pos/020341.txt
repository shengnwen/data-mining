In the first book "Angel of Death," followed by a second book "Angel of Justice," in the "Angelo Mystery Series," penned by veteran Philadelphia Police Officer Rosanna Filippello, the reader is left anxious to read more. 

The novels give readers an inside view of the Philadelphia police force at work. They allow one to see Philadelphia, "the city of brotherly love," in all it's splendor. It's a view that only a native to the area could offer. Filippello goes on to allow readers to glimpse the night life, the streets after dark, officers working diligently throughout the night to catch a serial killer. 

These books bring out the best of the Philadelphia police force with their portrayal of the heroic and self-sacrificing men and women ever vigilant in their surveillance of the city. Filippello, offers insight into these officers, both male and female, subtly bonding as family while working shoulder to shoulder to protect the sleepy, unsuspecting city of Philadelphia and the people they love. 

Angelo shows her power and intelligence as she leads, follows up on clues, and ultimately bags the bad guy. We glimpse her compassion and insight into the criminal mind as she interviews one suspect after another. She has a knack for reading people and the ability to put differences aside when work calls.

Anyone who reads these books will be anxious to read the third one in the series. It is obvious to those of us who know and work with Rosanna Filippello that she is a rising star in the literary world. 

Just keep in mind that "Angel of Death," is only the first  book in the "Angelo Mystery Series," and readers should buy other books is the series because they are real page turners..
