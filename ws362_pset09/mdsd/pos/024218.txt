i really like some like it hot because i just love zoey deans work but the only comment is tha tthe beginning of the book is too boring and not enough drama filled like i know she tring to add suspense but making a book 300 pages and only truths that came was cammmies dad had an affair with sam mom is boring. i read the book expecting something big but to only get a let down and sam with her  boyfriend find her with parker o wow thats drama like that doesn't happen daily i know im being critical but we need more at the beginning as well no more huge let down please!!
