How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people.  Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time.  I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.  

This book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing.  I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it.  But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did.  I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat.
