I was introduced to this book on a group ski trip. Coming in from a long day on the slopes, the house was full of the smell of roasting vegetables, baking bread and, yes, garlic.  Heaven.  I spent a good bit of time that weekend just reading Ms. Barrett's book.  Unlike Krikus, I found the book  to be easy and entertaining reading. You can learn a lot about a people and  their culture by spending a little time in their kitchens.   &quot;From an  Italian Garden&quot; allowed me that opportunity.  The food is simple and  appealing and the recipes are well-described and easy to follow. The cooks  that weekend sent my wife and I a copy of the book as a gift several weeks  later and it remains a treasure of our kitchen library
