This is one of those books that can truly change your life - if approached with an open mind...

Within "A New Beginning", the author discusses the laws of the universe, and how by following these laws, one can achieve the life they want.  This book is about how important our thoughts are in creating our experiences, including how they attract certain "types" of people into our lives.  Exercises are also included to help you utilize these universal laws to attract those experiences/people that you DO WANT, instead of those you'd like to avoid.

It's shown that we are responsible for EVERYTHING we experience, as we are the creators of our current life experiences - therefore, it no longer makes sense to spend time blaming others for our plight.  Instead, we need to figure out where we miscreated, and fix it by creating what we do want instead.

Although everything makes a lot of sense, and I can see how my thoughts have impacted my life, I still have 1 question... and that is re: the horrible experiences that some children go through - I'm uncertain as to how they brought those experiences into their lives.  But I feel certain that I'll gain a greater understanding of this as I research the other works by this author further.

As a side note, the information included in this book was obtained through the channeling of ABRAHAM - a group of entities in the non-physical universe - through Esther Hicks.

Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in changing some aspect of their life; those interested in universal laws; and those interested in communications from the other side.  

I would also recommend that you read "The Power of Intention" by Wayne Dyer, as this is another excellent book on the power of our thoughts, and how we can literally change our life by changing our thoughts
