I'm a huge fan of PostSecret and now own both of the PostSecret books.  I thought the first book was AMAZING.  I loved every page of it.  I was incredibly excited to own My Secret as well.  I bought it today and was a little disappointed in the length; a significant 144 pages shorter than the first.  I was also a little disappointed with parts of the layout.  It seemed to me there were too many enlarged postcards fitting 2 pages as well as quotes considering the length of the book.  There could have been a better use for those pages such as more meaningful postcards or additional quotes.

Regardless of my disappointment, I still recommend this book (as well as the website and first book).  The postcards and quotes were well chosen.  Overall, it was a good investment.  Good job, Frank
