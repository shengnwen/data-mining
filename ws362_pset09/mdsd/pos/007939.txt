This books make you want to go goof around with a video camera.  Though I'm not a "filmmaker", I did find a lot of useful tips and techniques to make the family videos a little less boring.  A few of the effects depend on software - and knowing how to use it.  Though I don't believe it says what software specifically, from the examples it is clearly Final Cut on a Mac.

Anyway, lots of fun and pretty useful - even if you're not a "filmmaker"
