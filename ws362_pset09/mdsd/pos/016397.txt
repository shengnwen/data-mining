The only thing better than this book for understanding how life works is the DVD The Secret. I say that only because it is so easy to watch or listen to the DVD while you work on something else...But the book Ask And It Is Given goes into much more detail about living on Earth, how we affect what happens in our lives etc. For the readers out there though, it doesn't get any better than this..
