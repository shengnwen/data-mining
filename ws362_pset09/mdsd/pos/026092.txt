This a very good sheet music book for Kenny G. It's written for Saxophone only. Several of his other books are written for piano and violin. This book includs some famous songs of his, Song Bird, Going Home etc. It has  big font and direction of how to play and many salient features. I love  this book. To those who love sax and Kenny. G. It's a great book! Buy it  and you will love it
