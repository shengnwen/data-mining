I have used this book for years.  I have found the recipies and techniques helpful and have never failed to impress my friends and coworkers with the results.  I love to cook and bake as well as make candy and it has been my expierence that no one book covers all one needs to know about making something.  I think this book is thorough and has provided more information than others I have looked at
