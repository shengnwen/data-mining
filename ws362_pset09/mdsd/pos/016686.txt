This book is absolutely perfect for helping children who have experienced trauma understand their feelings, consciously and subconsciously.  The story is straight forward about how sometimes we try to hide from the scary feelings created by trauma and how we may act out because of our trying to suppress those feelings.  It also gives children an entre' into how to handle these feelings while not telling them that everything will go back to the way it was.  Spectacular!  Probably the best child's self-help book I've read in a long time
