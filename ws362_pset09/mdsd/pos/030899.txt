I have many wonderful books on transformation and this book is in my top five, along with Hal and Sidra Stone's "Our Voices, Our Selves." "What We May Be" is a powerfully descriptive and useful book that will help any intelligent and interested reader deepen their spiritual awareness, transform their identity, issues and challenges and gain an embodied experience of their own complex consciousness.

I recommend using and reusing the exercises. I have done much work with Parts of Self and find that Psychosynthesis work can have a powerful cumulative effect when the exercises are repeated at intervals. The book can be especially useful as guidance for working with negative sub-personalities or Parts of Self that may be sabotaging your life success. I have noticed, in three years of working with this book, that I grow more sensative to energies within and outside of myself. I have absolutely had transcendent spiritual experiences following the step-by-step exercises in this book. It is the next best thing to working with a Psychosynthesis trained professional. For use of Psychosynthesis in healing cancer or illness, buy Alice Epstein's book "Mind, Fantasy and Healing." 

Wishing you powerful transformation, joy and success..
