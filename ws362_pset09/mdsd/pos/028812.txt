I absolutely despise most of what this book puts forth.  This book, the very bed rock of Romantic thought, is (in my opinion) the root of many of our modern problems because it begins unraveling of the basic thesis of the Enlightenment: cultivate reason and be wholey guided by it.  That being said a person cannot fully understand the Romantics, and by extension our own society, without first reading and understanding Rousseau.  The veneration of nature, the noble savage, all of the things that the Romantics aspired to or believed in has its seed in this book, so if you are a romantic or if you just want to understand more about this philosophical era, then this is the book for you
