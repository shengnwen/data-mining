This book will blow you away and inspire you!!  Even if you are NOT an actor.. it will give you awesome insight into the thinkings and inner workings of today's top actors.  As an actor who started in stand-up comedy - I cannot say more positive things about this book... Ivana explains exactly how to do what so many extraordinary actors have done.  She really gets behind the mind of the actor and shows you how to conquer any role. 

A truly MUST READ for any actor - well-known, currently working, or aspiring.  I keep it by my bedside at night, and carry it with any script that I am currently working on.

I would even say that it's a great book for the screenwriter - for them to realize what goes into an actor's mind to create a role.
