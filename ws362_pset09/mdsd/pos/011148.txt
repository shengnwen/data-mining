The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that I would have loved to see more famous works of art in the book, but I realized that since it comes from "The Metropolitan Museum of Art", they may not have those.  It's a great way to remember art pieces.  It's a fun way to study them as well.  As for violence in some of the paintings, I did not see anything even remotely as gruesome as some images our children are exposed to on the news or even in cartoons nowadays.  There is no reason to shut them off exposure to great art pieces because there is a battle scene in one of them.

Thre is an answer key at the end of the book, with items highlighed.  I really appreciated that feature, having spent 3 days searching for an item in one of "I Spy" books.  Those don't have answer key.  In the same answer key, there is a short description of each painting, short background of the artwork.  I found it very helpful as well
