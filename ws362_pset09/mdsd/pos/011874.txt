This is a brief but powerful description of the horror of Auschwitz.  Dr. Nyiszli was witness to the efficiency of the Nazi killing machinery, and is one of a very few such witnesses to survive.  His account is an important reminder of the magnitude of the barbarity that man is capable of inflicting on his fellows.  Dr. Nyiszli was also required to work with Dr. Josef Mengele, Auschwitz's "Angel of Death," helping him collect evidence to support his pseudo-scientific beliefs in Aryan superiority.  While this first-hand description of Dr. Mengele fails to shed any light on his motivations or behavior, it does show the level of attention he payed to every aspect of the horror that was Auschwitz.  Taken together with other eyewitness accounts, this book helps paint a more complete picture of the enormity of the Nozi crimes and the horror they inflicted
