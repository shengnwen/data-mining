I bought both the Berlitz and Barron's phrase books. This review is a comparison of the two.

They are both small enough to fit in a pocket. The Berlitz is 220 pages, the Barron's 320 pages -- the Barron's is marginally thicker. The Berlitz page seems slightly denser, with more lines per page, although I believe the font sizes used are almost identical (Berlitz sans serif (Arial-like), Barron's serif (Roman-like). The Barron's comes with a plastic cover which seems durable. Both are sorted into sections, for example, travel, eating out, etc. Berlitz has a 12 page menu reader. The Barron's covers a little more in 26 pages, including a guide to regional specialties. Barron's has a 47 page Italian-English and English-Italian dictionary. Berlitz is about the same. Both show Italian pronunciations in a phonentically English spelling. Barron's has a larger section on Italian grammar. Both have a good table of contents; only Barron's has an index as well. One small complaint with the copy of the Berlitz I received -- the print flows into the gutter (the spine of the book) too far, so that one has to really bend open the book to read the entire line. I think this will make the book fall apart sooner. One small complaint with the Barron's -- in a few cases they print black font on a dark color background for page headings (e.g., "Telling Time," "Months of the Year") which makes the headings difficult to read.

They are very comparable and both will do the job. Both can server not only as a travel guide, but also as a vocabulary builder for an Italian class. My overall impression is that the Barron's is marginally better
