I found this book to be an engrossing tale of the personalities and technologies that resided in Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)--some invented there, some developed more fully there, and many only being produced by other companies due to Xerox's short-sightedness. The laser printer, the mouse, windowing systems and overlapping windows, bitmapped graphics, computer processing of video images, the personal computer, Ethernet, email.

Hiltzik does a good job of presenting many faces in a large cast of characters and describing the alliances and clashes within Xerox PARC (and between PARC and the rest of Xerox). Of particular note is the greater detail on the story of Steve Jobs visits to PARC and how they occurred (Xerox was briefly an investor in Apple), in far more detail than has been given elsewhere (e.g., in Levy's Insanely Great)
