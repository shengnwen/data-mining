I'm not a dog breeder, past or future.  I wanted information on sire and dam selection, puppy development and conditioning prior to purchasing our next puppy.  We've had 9 dogs over the years.  This book would be rated 5 stars for a novice breeder.  It's well priced and covers all the basics of pregnancy, gestation, whelping and potential problems.  In the area of sire and dam selection (9 pages), the recommendation is to select a good example of the breed standard without any genetic faults.  A recommendation on nutrition (8 pages) is to select a &quot;premium dog food that has been feed trialed&quot;.  The puppy development section (12 pages) described the general development from birth to 8 weeks.  The information was general, basic and I didn't learn anything new.  Lots of color pictures of cute puppies.  A few illustrations of dog anatomy.  Several stories of dog patients Dr. Rice used for examples.  Easy writing style and very well indexed.  But very basic
