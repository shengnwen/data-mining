Having devoured Powell's book entitled "Bungalow Kitchens", I knew this book would be every bit as detailed and I was not disappointed. In case you doubt that an entire book can be filled with nothing but information on the exteriors of bungalow houses, I can assure you that page after page is replete with excellent color photographs, illustrations (both modern and period), detailed descriptions of various materials and techniques, and information to help you do a bungalow exterior the RIGHT way (don't paint those bricks!!).

My one and only complaint was the extremely short length of the chapter on foundations, but it's more than made up for by the incredibly detailed chapters on sidings, roofing materials, doors, windows, porches, fences, and much more. Each chapter has an exhaustive listing of suppliers for every kind of material.

We don't have a bungalow, but we will be building a reproduction bungalow house in the next few years and will rely heavily on this and all of Powell's other fine books for both information and inspiration
