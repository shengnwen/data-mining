Nights in Rodanthe by Nicholas Sparks was one of the best love novels I have ever read.  This story is romantic on many levels.  Nearly everyone can relate to this book in some way.  Not only can you relate to this story but it gives you a sense of hope and for the older readers, it will take you back to your youth and of the days of young love.  The main character is watching her friends Bed and Breakfast on the beach in North Carolina for the weekend while she goes out of town.  During this weekend there is only one person staying in the house.  He is an attractive, middle age successful surgeon.  Since there is a huge storm coming, the two are stuck in the house for the weekend.  During this time, they become very close and slowly start to become attracted to one another since they are in similar situations, of a recent divorce.  Although they come from two completely different lifestyles, they find a lot on common and hit it off right away.  The ending of the story is not what would be expected but still has an uplifting feel and leaves you filled with hope and satisfaction.  I would defiantly recommend this book to some one who is looking for a romantic love story that takes you through ups and downs through the entire novel.
