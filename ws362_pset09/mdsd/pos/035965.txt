The novel Shiloh Season is an excitant novel by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. Shiloh Season is a good book.
In the narrative the characters were unbelievable. Marty and Shiloh are my favorite characters. Judd was mean at beginning at the end Judd was a nice guy. Phyllis Naylor wrote such an enchanting novel. She should rite another Shiloh story.
My favorite scenes in this novel is when Shiloh licked Judd's hand. If I would not change in I would not because Shiloh Season is a good book. 
I learned from this novel that you should not people. I would recommend this book for my friends because I is a good book.
