Thank you, Amazon, for recommending this exquisite novel to me as a Gold Box special.  With an afterword by Annie Proulx and the recent success of Brokeback Mountain, this exceptional piece of western literature should now find the audience Thomas Savage so richly deserved in 1967.  As restrained and sparing in language as its central antagonist, Phil Burbank, Savage has the uncanny gift of eloquence through omission, allowing the reader to read between the lines.  I was captivated by his talent, and jolted by an entirely unexpected but immensely satisfying conclusion.  This book has been five times optioned for film, yet never made.  I doubt that will go on much longer
