My 10 year old grandson has leukemia and is currently hospitalized for it. I used this book to help him visualize his immune system and create a healing experience.  I haven't found much out there that is actually written for kids (this book is also a guide for adults), but it's easy to adapt what there is in this book to fit your child's situation with a just a little effort and imagination. I found the examples very encouraging and helpful as well. Following the examples of paintings and drawings found in the book...I think this helped him feel more in control over the disease
