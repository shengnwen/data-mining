I had never before read a Shane Stevens novel and only happened to come across it thanks to advertising conducted by Stephen King in the back of his novel &quot;The Dark Half&quot;. Mr. Stevens- at least as far as the  reviews here go- is only noted for his success in &quot;By Reason of  Insanity&quot; which is a book I intend reading in the near future. All the  reviews about it make of it an excellent novel. This one too should have  deserved attention from others other than me, to write a review about it.  It is an excellent well crafted and ingenious thriller, and Mr. Stevens  deserves to be commended for his work
