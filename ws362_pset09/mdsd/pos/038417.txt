My 2 year old son really loves this book, there are A LOT of things to look at and it pretty much covers all the basic words and then some.  He can use this book until he is 5 years old.  I like this book because it has stuff in it that you actually see everyday.  Other books have complicated words or show items that are not everyday things.  The only complaint I have is that the pages tear easily since the book is wire bound, otherwise I would of given it 5 stars.  Definitely a great book to teach your little one his/her first words
