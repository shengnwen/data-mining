Google is nowadays known by a large percentage of people surfing the web. Surveys usually put Google as the first search engine in the world (before other Yahoo!, MSN and Ask Jeeves). Two journalists, D. Vise and M. Malseed, tell the whole Google story from its very beginning (even before Google starts in 1998). Their book tells you the story of Google from several points of views. They skip from search engine to financial as well as human ressource point of views. This gives to my mind a good overall view of Google as a whole. I will summarize by saying that this book is for you if you:

    * Know Google and want to know more about it
    * Want to have an overall view of Google with no technical concepts
    * Like well writen success stories

However, this book is perhaps not for you if you:

    * Want technical details about Google
    * Are interested in the dark side of Google
    * Need a 100% objective view on this search engine

Finally, I found this book very well writen and also interesting. The only drawback is the sometimes subjective point of view of the writers. They use Google and they like it, therefore it's pretty difficult to give an objective mind about it
