This book is very aptly titled.  The poems feel like waking up in a pile of cinders that used to be a house.  Not sad really.  Just sort of empty.  As if everything has been reduced to stark facts with a few flowers  sprouting here and there out of the ashes.  There is something profoundly  touching about these poems.  They do an amazing job of conveying the spent  feeling after the huge emotional turmoil of losing a parent.  One line from  the book that runs through my head sometimes:  &quot;After a pause, she  says--he hears her say--'I love you like salt.'&quot
