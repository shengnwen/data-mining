I am agree with Lewis on most issues (95%). Someone previously said that Lewis kind of sexist, which is nothing but bad-labeling. I am sexist also to some extent... who knows. Bible is sexist by the way too. (at least may be argued by some)
-- interestingly enough, I am 24 living in 21st century, think almost like Lewis. I never considered 'friendship' between male and female as actually possible. You can kill me for this, but you cannot prove otherwise. THere are DIFFERNCES of relationships, which we call the same - friendship. When we read Romeo and Juliet, I cannot see any friendship there. WHen I read the Bible, accidentally I cannot see much of friendship between males and females there too. I am not saying that they didn't communicate with each other, but clearly there was never a friendship, as we now it. Most of the boy-girl friendships end-up in the bedroom. So why not open up our eyes and admit that there is HUGE differences between different types of relationships? I am not saying that Lewis classified all possible kinds of relationships. No, of course. But what must be noted, that they are VERY different, and to expect same kind of relationship and commitment from both males and females is pathetically naive. 
Sorry folks old times are gone, feminism, Dan Brown with vagina-worship is on the top charts, and even some reviewer before me critisized Lewis to being "behind" in thinking (as if he is mentally undeveloped as majority today). Today, it's sick to watch TV and to read papers. World gone wild, so stick to people like Lewis, Geisler, Moreland, Stott, (good philosophers and theologians) etc. Don't let feminsm take over :D
thanks
