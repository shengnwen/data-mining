I have to say this is one of the best romance historicals I have ever read.  It reminds me of another Stuart book "To Love A Dark Lord" I love bad boys and only Stuart knows how to write about them and redeem them. I loved the way the hero called the heroine "dragon".  Anne Stuart sucked me in from the very beginning and I couldn't stop reading until 3 A.M.  Her characterization of the main characters is so real, I felt I knew them personally and I could see them in my mind's eye.  This book is definitely going on my keeper shelf because I plan to read it again and again.  I can only hope I don't have to wait a long time to read another historical by her
