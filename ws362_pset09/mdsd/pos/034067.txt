This sharp new book reads like it was written by the witty, imperfect, cooler older sister you wish you had; the one who walks around with a dryer sheet unknowingly stuck to her back but manages to give the most spot on advice for any of those twenty something angst moments we all have had. She is down to earth, funny, and writes about things all of us twenty somethings have experienced.

This was great bathtime reading; the wisdom and humor have been pared down into pithy little essays and vignettes, which makes it great for on the go or beach reading. You can sit down and read the whole book at once or stretch it out and enjoy it bit by bit. Either way, this was a real hit with me and I will be recommending it to my friends
