Heavy book but an easy read. I have been trying to understand Mexico and reading all I can.  The better books have been Conquest by Thomas, Mexico by Krauze and LaCapita by Kandell. Fehrenbach surpasses them all by a  factor of two.   For a &quot;non-fiction&quot; reader it is a smooth read  and chunked full of significant observations and facts that a  &quot;Gringo&quot; needs to understand when dealing with Mexico.  It is a  must read for the business executive working in Mexico as well as the  historian trying to understand Mexico's feelings towards the United States
