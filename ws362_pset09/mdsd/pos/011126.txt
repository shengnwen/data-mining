I can't begin to describe how beneficial this book is. In fact, I would run out of space here before I even got halfway through an explanation. I will forever be referencing this book and gaining new insights with each read. I have a notebook full of notes that I took as I read the book, and applied her statements to my life, and events therein. It explained so much, and made a remarkable connection to just about everything. As I go through my "phases" in life, I expect more notebooks of scribbled notes, page references and quotes that will certainly apply and give new insights. I've given a copy to all my closest girlfriends and they too loved it. Every woman should read this book and keep a copy handy!
