You want to know what Britney Spears, Columbine, and Gary Condit have in common? Just read this book and you'll get your answer as well some great insights into our twisted little culture at the present.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, online detractors, I heard it all before-he's stolen material from such classics as &quot;The Culture of Narcisissm&quot; and other works. He's unfocused, pompous,etc.  Call him what you will, but I think it's brilliant how he uses myths and fairy tales to lead us into our modern day predicaments that we all sense on some vague level but can't articulate them clearly. And in the end, he is right on target with his arguments. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't whisper &quot;sibling society&quot; under my breath-whether it's that I see a 45 year old mother of 4 with a picture of a supermodel taped to her fridge to stop her from eating or the myriad of &quot;reality programming&quot; shows on every major network. Bly is a cultural prophet with a very thought provoking set-up that stays with you long after you finish the book
