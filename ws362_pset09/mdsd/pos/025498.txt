I found this book is quite deep and quickly gets into the realm of conceptual and spiritual ideas.  Just as the well-known book "The Inner Game of Golf" deals with the mental side of the game, this book addresses the spiritual side.  Having read this, I'm not totally convinced that I understand all the points that are being made, and some are easier to take on board than others.  My interpretation of the overall message of this book is that it is all about coming to understand your own place in things and learning to transcend the tensions that exist within life.  This is mirrored in golf and the way we approach the game.  It should be pointed out that the book isn't really about lowering your golf handicap as such.  Like any text concerning spiritual matters, faith and a willingness to suspend cynicism play a big part in determining how much you get out of this.  Overall this book is enjoyable and intriguing at the same time, but some of the concepts might be better explained
