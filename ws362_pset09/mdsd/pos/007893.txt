What an amazing collection of pictures detailing the history and evolution of the American automobile. The text in this book is basic support for this massing of pictures of factories that most probably have never heard of, like REO, Overland, Oakland, Marion, Queen, Chalmers, DeVaux-Hall, Ruxton and a great many others, all American companies. At the height of the auto industry boom, prior to the Great Depression, there were over 1,900 manufactures of American automobiles. Also, before the Great Depression, one out of every six people were employed by the auto industry. This book is for the person that knows a great deal about automobiles and would like to go back to the days of Henry Ford, Billy Durant, Walter Chrysler, John and Horace Dodge, Ransom Olds, Louis Chevrolet, Henry Leland, David Buick and all of the other greats that started a passion that would change America and the world forever
