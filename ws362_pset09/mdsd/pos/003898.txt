If you're relatively new to this genre, you'd probably give this a five. If you've read some, you might lower it to a 3-1/2 or four.

It started strong, introducing similar elements to G.R.R.M's Fire and Ice (the first three books in that series I consider some of the best I've ever read), but then it lost some vigor, or sense of purpose. It lost some sort of spark; the thing that keeps you turning pages when you ought to go to bed.

In spite of that, this is a good series so far, and it's worth your time to read it. Some things the characters do are emotionally puzzling, but that may be explained in future novels
