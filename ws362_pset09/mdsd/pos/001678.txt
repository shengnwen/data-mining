When we first heard about this book, some of the guys in the shop were skeptical about how it would turn out.  We have all read articles and stories about the work we do and wondered how the writers got it so wrong.  Embellishments, mis-quotes, and cheesy bravado injected into stories about Coast Guard swimmers have often left us cold to the idea of a book about the job.  But Laguardia-Kotite got it right.....way right.

Her book is meticulously researched, well-organized, and tells the story of Coast Guard rescues without overstepping the facts in exchange for reactions.  She simply put to paper the heart of the program through stories of actual men and women engaged in the unique job of aviation rescue crewmembers.  Also refreshing was the way she (better than anyone I have ever read) tells the story of the rescue swimmer as part of a team, giving all due credit to the pilots and flight mechanics that make rescue at sea possible.
