In the first two chapters of the book, Howard Gardner considers those components that make leadership possible. He reviews the features of human development that make possible the phenomena of leadership: humans' primate status, early socialization and so on. The author introduces a set of distinctions that figure in a cognitive approach to leadership: such factors as direct/indirect forms of leadership, leadership within and across domains, inclusionary/exclusionary kinds of stories, identity stories, the embodiment of stories, and resistances and counterstoreis.  The author identifies four factors crucial to the practice of effective leadership: a tie to the community (or audience); a certain rhythm of life (combination of being inside the fire and being able to do reflection in isolation); an evident relation between Stories and Embodiments; and the centrality of choice.

The following chapters are studies of leaders in different domains, based on the biographies of these persons and general histories of the period. The studies are interesting and noteworthy.

The drawback of the book is that the authors' framework is not quite easy to form an image of it in the mind, i.e. not quite solid. There may be sometimes not very easy to find the links between the framework presented in the first two chapters with the studies of the leaders from the remaining chapters.

I highly recommend the books by Ronald A. Heifetz: "Leadership Without Easy Answers" and "Leadership on the Line", which say essentially the same about leadership, but the framework of Ronald A. Heifetz is much more elegant and explained better in comparison with one proposed by Howard Gardner
