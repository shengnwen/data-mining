This was the one that started it all.  The first book to feature the iconic character "Tarzan".  Very entertaining and influential.  But there are a few plot holes.  Tarzan teaches himself how to read English, without ever hearing the language.  He manages this by matching the printed words to the pictures in the books.  A little farfetched, but not completely implausible.  But how does he know how to spell "Tarzan" when he has never seen it printed and doesn't know what sounds the letters make?  Regardless of that, it's a very enjoyable book that moves at a fast pace
