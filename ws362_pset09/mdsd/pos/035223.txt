must have near your wine cellar! each time i cook a dish or even having a take out, i can look up appropriate wine for it in just few seconds without needing to read several pages why and how to match them. The reference in the begging is there in case your wondering how these matches were made, but if u r in a hurry to match wine and food and start enjoying them, it is a good book
