I read a book on a recent flight for recreation called, A Briefer History of Time by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.  It is about quantum physics.  I have huge respect for Stephen Hawking.  He suffers from a terrible disease and is confined to a wheelchair and is basically a quadrapelegic yet he has a brilliant mind and a way of simplifying things that makes it easy to understand.  Stephen Hawking is a physicist and an astronomer and the book deals with both physics and astronomy and the interaction of materials, planets, etc.  It is a totally fascinating book and I would highly recommend it.

The only thing that I did not like about the book is that it burst my bubble on Isaac Newton who he claims was not a pleasant man and his relationships with other people were very strained.

It is also interesting to read about the relationship between religion and science and how tough it was on people like Galileo.
