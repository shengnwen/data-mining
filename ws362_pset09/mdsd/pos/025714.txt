This book is an invaluable tool to any serious movie viewer.
It's wealth of information is indispensable. I've been using this book as a resource for almost ten years. Movies and their year, a brief and professional synopsis, ratings, movie length, people involved....this book has it all.

If you like movies, you'll like this book
