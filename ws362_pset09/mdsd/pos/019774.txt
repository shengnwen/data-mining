I studied French in high school 30+ years ago and hated it.  Then I took four semesters in a community college 20 years ago (after learning Spanish) and loved it, but had little use for the language in any daily use.  However, in planning to spend a month in France next year, I decided that I should study French again.  This dictionary has been a wonderful aid in my studies.  Although there are better, more expensive dictionaries (I personally own Petit Larousse Illustre and Harper Collins French College Dictionary), this one has an amazing amount of information and is so small and light that it can be easily referenced where a large bulky dictionary will be left on the shelf as an impediment to reading.  

To resume learning French, I am reading Harry Potter A L'Ecole Des Sorciers (the Sorcerer's Stone book) and this dictionary is always at hand.  The dictionary includes a surprising number of idiomatic phrases, a handy verb conjugation section, pronunciation and grammar sections.  It is also handy that it includes words such as "eu", which is the past participle for avoir, and references one back to the infinitive form of the verb -- very useful when one hasn't yet mastered the past participles that are essential to the passe compose (a common past tense).

For just a few bucks, this is an amazing trove of information
