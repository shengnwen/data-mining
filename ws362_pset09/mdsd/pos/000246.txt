This is a truly unique manual for all those of us who seek greater intimacy, satisfaction and self expression in our sex lives.  I've read many books about how to improve intimacy and sex, but none with such humor and simplicity.  Dr. Sprinkle's Spectacular Sex can be a real tool in your relationship. My partner and I read it together. He is usually resistant to self-help programs and...well, ideas about how we might improve things, but this book actually was something we could share. Annie's loving nature shines through, and her insights and empathy lit the way on our path to improving our sex (and love) life. I recommend this book especially for couples, but also for single people who are looking for more intimacy in their lives
