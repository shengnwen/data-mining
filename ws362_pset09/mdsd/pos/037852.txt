I was very interested in this book as I also had a severe reaction to Floxin, given for a swollen gland in my neck.  I experienced extreme insomnia with strange geometric hallucinations. I couldn't sleep for 3 days  and was convinced that I was going insane. (Some people already think that!  LOL!)  I had a hard time contacting my Dr. over the weekend.  When I  finally did, he said he'd never heard of this kind of severe reaction, but  changed my perscription.  I discussed it with a local Sav-On pharmacist,  and he confirmed that those reactions did happen in a small percentage of  people.   I was lucky that the side effects went away in about 24 hours
