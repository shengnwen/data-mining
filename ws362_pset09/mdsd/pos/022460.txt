This book I believe is a good "2nd Step" into classical music, meaning you know a little about a few pieces, a few composers, etc.  Now you want to know what to look into next, and you don't know anyone who likes classical music because you've spent most of the last four years of your life in Iraq...sorry about that. Anyway this book is great, a lot of info about nearly every relevant composer and most of the relevant pieces.  Getting ready to make the 2nd step? Read this...and keep me updated!
