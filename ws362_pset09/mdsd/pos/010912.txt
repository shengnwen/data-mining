"When Religion Becomes Evil," is a collection of five essays that can help every religious believer recognize five warning signs that indicate that a religion, cult or sect has become demented.   The more intolerant the religious teachings, the more exclusive the cultic claims, the more imperialistic a religion becomes, the higher probability that it is heading in the wrong direction;  and soon, if unchecked, our world will feel the effects of its evil. 

Charles Kimball recalls the history of evil that deranged religion have brought to our world.   
His stories of suffering induced by religious fanatics bring home the importance of this book. Kimball shows how the Crusades of the Middle Ages, the  9-11 attack on the USA, the unabated killing in Israel and Palestine, the mass suicides and attacks on society by followers of cultic, charismatic leaders like, David Koresh, Jim Jones and Asahara Shoko are all integrals to religion(s) gone amuck.  The recounting of these world events alone makes the book an engaging read.

Kimball favors the major world religions, and especially those that are oriented toward the "golden rule" and seeking the transcendent.  Christianity and Islam get the lion share of the writing, due to their size, world influence, monotheism and their history of conflicts and carnage. 

His writing  is clear, straight foreword, and unencumbered by religious jargon.  This is a helpful guide for study groups, for high school and college introductory classes, and for all of us trying to understand the dark side of the world in which we live
