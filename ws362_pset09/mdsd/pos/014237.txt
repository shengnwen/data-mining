After E. Morris's biography of Reagan, titled Dutch, proved a disaster, scholars have been looking for the true explanation of the 20th century's most influential president.  Morris could find no explanation, no "hook" to reveal the "real" figure.  Despite unprecedented access to sources, Morris went so far as to invent a fictional character in his narrative.  That is an indefensible technique.

Kengor (and a shorter similar work by Mary Beth Brown) rightly identify Reagan's Christian faith as the "real" reason for his strong positions.  And Reagan had plenty of background in this area from his mother and life in a small middle American town with regular church activities and membership.  (Those who try to cite his lack of church attendance during his presidency overlook the security aspects after the assassination attempt, and the fact that Reagan had private services in the White House.)

Another attmpt to find the "hook" is Peter Schweizer's Reagan's War, which identifies his hatred of Communism as stemming from Hollywood days and a 1946 strike that Reagan opposed despite har nosed tactics by the Communist dominated union.  Schweizer gave us a fine book, with real focus on Reagn's political views.  However, Kengor's is even broader and more encompassing in its Christian view which reveals even more than a hatred of Communism.  Highly recommended.
