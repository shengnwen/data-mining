I would have to start off by saying that Dr. Atkins is wonderful.  I bought this book to help me track the number of carbs in my diet.  I have been very successful by using the book and its carb levels, in fact, I would not have been as successful with the ANA if it had not been for this book.  It does not have all of the foods or brands listed but it has many of the well known ones that can be found almost anywhere.  I owe a huge success to this book and would recommend it to anyone who is trying to count their carbs and follow this plan.  30 pounds in a month and half should be worth something
