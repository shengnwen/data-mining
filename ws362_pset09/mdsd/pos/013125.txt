The book "501 Spanish Verbs" was recommended to our adult education Spanish class by the teacher. It includes an "Essential 55 Verb List". Even if you only study the verbs on the list of 55, you should be able to conjugate just about any verb you come across and also be able to express yourself in correct idiomatic Spanish.
