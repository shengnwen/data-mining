Bill Clinton writes a very interesting account of his life in an inviting conversational style. His story-telling approach easily draws the reader into the events of his life. I especially enjoyed the amount of time he spent discussing his childhood. He expresses the pain and isolation that he felt very well. He is a talented communicator and this comes through as he tells his story. The words flowed one after another and I was easily captivated by the details. This review actually refers to the audio CD unabridged version, Part I. However, after 21 CD's for Part I alone, I did become tired of all of the drawn-out explanations and wished I got the abridged version. Overall, it was a great book and I am going to also read Part 2. It provides insight and apology for the actions of our ex-president. He seems to have written it to make amends with those he offended
