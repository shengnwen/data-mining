Of all the books I've read, this is the best book on using natural therapies to manage sinusitis. It's a terrific book!! The program recommended is easy to use and it definitely works. This book motivated me to finally get in control of the constant congestion and drainage from years of sinusitis. I realized that conventional medication and antibiotics could not always relieve the symptoms of sinusitis. But the vitamins, herbs, and foods recommended in this book help to decrease inflammation. The other complementary therapies help the sinuses to drain, and the saline rinse keeps the sinuses flowing so they don't get all clogged and infected
