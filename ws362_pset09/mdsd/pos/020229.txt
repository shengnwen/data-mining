I borrowed the 3 part PBS vhs Knitting Workshop series featuring Elizabeth Zimmermann.  I've been knitting for 20+ years and learned so many new things from her no-nonsense knitting techniques that I've changed how I knit.  She is a knitting icon and this book is an excellent extention of her videos.  

The book is not a "pretty" book as many recently published knitting books are, but it is chock full of knitting techniqes and know-how.  This is a must have for any serious knitter
