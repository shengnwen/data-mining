A middling effort by Carl Hiaasen still rates as a better than average read, and Skin Tight will not rank even remotely near his better stuff like Skinny Dip and Striptease.  Maybe it's not fair to call this a middling effort though, since it was written in 1989.  Since then Hiaasen has just written a lot of very, very good books.  Dated though it may be this is still a lot of fun!

Mick Stranahan is a retired detective, semi-forced into retirement by a fatal encounter with a corrupt judge.  That alone might explain why someone is trying to kill him, but nothing is ever quite so simple as it seems.  How else to explain the lethal impact of a weed whacker?  And is it possible that the people behind the movie Fargo happened to read Skin Tight while writing that movie?  Inquiring minds want to know since the two otherwise disparate efforts share a black comedy style with a single semi-critical plot twist.

You'll get a further update of Stranahan's adventures in crime and love, in the more recent Skinny Dip.  But this makes for a great introduction.

As with all of Hiaasen's books that I've read, this is a perfect book to share.  Do you have a significant other that likes to read aloud from the newspaper?  Does your traveling companion think that the latest Alan Greenspan lecture is one that has to be shared in minute detail?  Trust me, you'll find plenty of return fire in Hiaasen's writing.  You'll be laughing aloud so often, and with such volume that they will be begging you to explain what's so funny.  And even if they don't, you'll want to read parts aloud just because you can!
