I came across this book 10 years ago at a seminar and have been giving it to patients ever since. It is very well-written especially for the layman, providing numerous things to think about it in the face of chronic bladder problems.  Being a chiropractor, I also found it fascinating that Dr. Gillespie basically spells out the whole theory behind chiropractic care when she cites that the number one cause of bladder and prostate problems is low back problems! Using diagrams she shows how the nerves enamating from the lumbar spine enervate these areas of the body.  Though she doesn't mention chiropractic care in her book, I had to laugh when I saw that she had, however unwittingly, totally validated the science and theory of Chiropractic care.  Whatever the underlying cause of your bladder problem, you are likely to find some help with this book
