Okay, forgive my purple prose. But this book seems to evoke that kind of emotion, filled as it is with images of people at their most open, their most shocking and their most vulnerable...and yes, their most naked. If you are offended by nudity or just plain horrorific images, pass this one by. But if you want a glimpse of the 60s in all its countercultural glory (and naivete), buy this one. Read it. Look at the images and hear the voices of some of the people who were considered icons of the time. It was truly the best and worst of times (stealing from Dickens). But also a courageous moment in our collective history. I'm thankful that Avedon took photos throughout these years
