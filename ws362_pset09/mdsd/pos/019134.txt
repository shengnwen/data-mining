Greeley teases and comforts us again in a thoroughly enjoyable read.  I particularly like the olde Celtic concept which may or may not be total fiction in the belief that those we have lost reside in a land of many colours to the west, where they can observe the lives of those that were nearest but not necessarily dearest to them in life. This latest book from Mr Greeley has given me the desire to go back and read many of the books he has written, that I missed.  I do love the Blackie as a divine inspector and relish the humour that pervades his work.  Patently.
