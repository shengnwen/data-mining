Movies have a deep impact on our society, from fashion to catch phrases, and most importantly attitudes. Even the most trivial movie is shaped by some underlying theme or message that is subtly delivered to millions of minds on a subconscious level at least. By utilizing the steps outlined in this book and on the corresponding website, readers are encouraged to view their entertainment choices seriously to avoid being molded into someone they don't want to be. Some of the films that the author suggests as good choices are startling; and lest anyone think a book on Christian films will only contain fluffy, feel good movies put out by white bread companies, let me assure you that there are quite a few R rated movies, gross out comedies, and even a Christian themed vampire movie described as worthwhile films. This book would make an excellent adult Sunday school curriculum, or serve well as a simple guide for how to use one's free time viewing purposefully.
