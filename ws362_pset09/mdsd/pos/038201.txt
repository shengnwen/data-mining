This book is amazing.  Step by step instructions on how to be a teacher.  What to do and when to do it, along with instructions on what to wear and what to say.  So many other books I have read left me feeling like teaching was impossible.  This is not that book. This is truly an encouraging "you can do this" approach.  However, it doesn't stop with "you can do this" but actually tells you how.  Wonderful and essential for new and experienced teachers.
