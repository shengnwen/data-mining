Conspiracy theories are not my favorite plot device.  It is hard for me to identify with the strong feelings expressed by many of the characters in this book, but I do believe people, particularly of the English upper classes, felt them.  This is not my favorite Perry, but it is hard to deny that she is a superb writer.  Her ability to crease a sense of time and place are unparallel.
