Charles Chestnutt's A Conjure Woman is a collection of short stories told by a former slave named Julius to a White couple who have recently moved to the South.  Written at the turn of the century, Chestnutt was addressing a primarily White audience who were recovering from Reconstruction and were  fond of plantation-style literature which looked upon slavery with  nostalgia.  On the surface, the author seems to be catering to the  nostalgic pre-Civil War idea, but in actuality, Julius' stories have a much  deeper moral which reveal a harsh and terrible way of life for Blacks of  the time.  Mixed with elements of magic and conjuring, Julius' seems to be  telling fanciful fairy tales, but with a closer look, one realizes that  Chestnutt has no fondness or nostalgia for the times of slavery.  This is a  well-written and thought-provoking book and it is an important novel of  America's history
