This is a highly emotional and well-written work that explores a very taboo subject matter.  The play revolves a case of forbidden love, in this case, Giovanni's incestuous love for his sister Annabella.  It's pretty easy to figure out after the first few pages that the play will have a tragic ending, but there are several major surprises that happen along the way, and the final scene is unbelievably violent.  I'd love the chance to stage a production of &quot;Tis Pity&quot; one of these days...from a directorial standpoint, the script is filled with many interesting possibilities
