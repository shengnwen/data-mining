This book is pure genius.  I could not put it down which is becoming the norm when I am reading Brian Lumley.  The group of &quot;explorers&quot;  each experience their own deepest fears in a world made just for that  purpose and they experience each others worlds also.  The human race is on  trial and it is a hung jury.  Spencer demonstrates his superior mental and  moral qualities and gets to the bottom of this mystery.  Very well detailed  scenarios and characters help to captivate you and envelop you in Brian  Lumleys imagination.  What a great book, I wish there was a number two to  read
