This was my daughters very very favorite book. She had all the words memorized by the time she was barely 3. I would ask the questions from the book and she would respond with the answers. I still ask her Whose Mouse Are You ? sometimes and her own baby will be born in October. By the way, until we find out the sex of the baby we are calling him/her mouse. Your kids will love this book too
