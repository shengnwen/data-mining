I guess I am rather new to gay fiction and picked this one up before moving overseas for an assignment. I half expected it to be very stereotypical, campy and cheezy...in the end I ended up passing it along to someone else to read as I found it to really reach out and touch me on some deeper plane. I dont know why - just did.  In any case really enjoyed the story and style in which it was written.  Another book i had picked up in the same genre doesnt even compare to this one.
