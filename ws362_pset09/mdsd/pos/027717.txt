I'm currently studying to become a teacher and I bought this book for my children's lit class. It's an amazing book. With so much television and video games so many children are no longer using their imagination. This book ivites children to take a walk with their own crayons (one can only hope they take this walk on paper, but we've never had trouble with this) and see where it leads them. A wonderful book, with fun pictures
