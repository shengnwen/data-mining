A well crafted thriller with interesting, complex characters.  It is one that I did not want to put down.  I only wish there were more pages to it with more background of the characters and more details.  It is one that I did not want to end but couldn't wait to get through it to get the whole story.

This is a spy classic.  It hasn't lost its edge over time at all. It is some of the best suspense, action writing I have read--skillful and artistic not like some of the packaged, thesaraus writing milled out by some of today's writers.

Go for it; you will be pleased I think
