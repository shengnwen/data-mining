Journalist, Steve Salerno, writes a provocative exposition on self-help culture in America.  Skewering both its chipper leaders and hopeful followers, he reveals the flawed, indulgent, and contradictory underbelly of a self-help industry that may be doing more bad than good. Salerno's bright investigative light does not flatter Tony Robbins, Dr. Laura, and many other self-help gurus.  

Salerno's book, whether one agrees or disagrees with the premise, does make many insightful observations.  He points out the extreme nature of the varied messages from the self-improvement section; how, on the one hand, the self-help and actualization movement encourages hopelessness and victimization while, on the other hand, it encourages empowerment to the point of deeming oneself a demi-god. He also describes how the entire 12 billion dollar a year industry is premised on the hope that people buying these products don't really become more self-sufficient and self-actualized.  If people were "Getting Their Best Lives Now" they would stop needing to buy self-help books.  Therefore, the industry perpetuates insecurity among self-help converts to keep their audience running on the self-help treadmill. 

An interesting and challenging book for those with stacks of Robbins, Peale, Hill, Warren, Carnegie, and Dyer on their side table.
