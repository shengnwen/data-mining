     From this wacky family with pet snakes, fireworks, playwrites, and dancers: you learn to expect anything that doesn't make sence, but what you don't expect is them to make sence!  That is exactally what happens.  When Alice, daugher of Paul and Penny, tells them of the young man that is calling for her, they instantly accept him into the family.  His family, however, is not so accepting.  
     My high school has just started preparing for our performance of this wonderful play.  We have all fallen in love with the script and are eager to perform.  This is a wonderful choice for any theater program, I am sure that anyone can find it entertaining
