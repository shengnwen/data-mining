The Book, "The Bronze  Bow" is the best book I've ever read. The Book is about a young Jewish boy living in the time of the Romans; he despises and hates the Romans because they killed his Father and caused the death of his mother and permanently scarred his sister. He becomes part of an outlaw gang to try and get the Romans out of Israel in whatever way possible. While recruiting men and boys he sees a carpenter teaching people to put down their weapons, help one another and to love your neighbor as yourself which he thinks is ridiculous. But, will this humble carpenter, teach him that to love your enemy is the true way to happiness, not revenge?
