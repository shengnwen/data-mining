I recently participated in a book club in which we discussed Zeldin's, &quot;An Intimate History of Humanity&quot;, and a friend gave me his new, little book to compare his approach to a different subject matter.   Since I am an artist, she wanted me to also critique the illustrations.          I was unexpectedly impressed by the beauty and charm of the original art work, and realize that Zeldin is not only a great thinker, but also an original artist, so the book is now on my Christmas list as a lovely gift for someone who can benefit from his words of wisdom about &quot;talking&quot; as well as enjoy the elegant, colorful expressions of conversation
