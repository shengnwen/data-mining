This book has been a tremendous help in my career as a professional musician. I have been a seasoned pro for over 20 years and I thought I knew it all, yet there is so much I didn't know which I should have known years ago. They should teach this stuff in any music school. It is written in accesable language and as far as I know this is the only book on the music business written by a professional musician instead of some lawyer or retired record executive.
