This book requires lots of time because you just can't put it down.  Marisa and her crazy neighbors have their lives turned upside down when their little town is sold on EBAY. What will happen to Peacos Belle's?  What about the martian landing pad?  
What was Terry Ledger thinking when he bought a Texas town on EBAY?  What was he going to do with the residents?  What was he going to do about the budding romance that could cause him to sabotage his own big plans?  These questions were answered in a fun, full of life, emotional rollercoaster of emotions that is Sweet Water.  This book like Anna Jeffrey's others is full of vivid full color writing.  I find myself smelling the coffee brewing and feeling a part of the action.  Now that I have fallen in love with all of these characters and I do mean characters,I need to know what happens next... Sequil PLEASE
