This book is  written beautifully, the parallels of the narrator and the diaries of his Grandparents are wonderfully portrayed.
An engaging book about past and present.  The struggles of life in 1970 and life in 1877. The Grandson with bone disease is obsessed about writing his Grandparents history.  
Much of this book is written in letters to Augusta, Susan's best friend.  Susan and Oliver start out in 1877 with many hopes and dreams, but as life often has it, there are disappointments and heartaches.  There was much to appreciate about moving to the West, there was also much to fear. 
I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a brilliant novel by Mr. Stegner.
