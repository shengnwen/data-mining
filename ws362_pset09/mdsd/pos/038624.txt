I'm at home on bed rest and desperate for something good to read.  This book did the trick..  The narrator is smart, funny, and clearly aware that it is next to impossible to do much about most of the evil sleaziness of the world.  Certainly it is impossible to make changes in individual lives, one at a time.  (Or maybe I'm just jaded, too.  Some may call it maturity.)  Clearly, the narrator is the most decent character in a novel full of morally bankrupt people (from both sides of the tracks).  Ironically, his career is blindsided due to what others perceive to be questionable morals.   Anyway, join Max as he watches pathetic people with and without class, power, and agency screw up their lives even more than they already have, and help him make sense of it.  Great literature this ain't, but a smart, fun, cynical read it is
