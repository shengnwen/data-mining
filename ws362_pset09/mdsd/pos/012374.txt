In this book Mr. Spanyi's thought leadership is some of the clearest and timeliest I have ever encountered in a business publication. An expert himself, he has (happily) the expert's ability to reduce complex subject matter to an elegantly simple and instructive message. I recommend this book above all others to anyone who may be curious about what it means to be entrepreneurial in the 21st century, which is to say, everyone who must consider their business in light of customer requirements
