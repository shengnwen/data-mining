While not a book for everyone, Light on Yoga by BKS Iyengar is a fabulous book for anyone seriously interested in yoga.  It has good pictures, excellent, progressive lesson plans, and plenty of other information on hatha yoga.

This book really is a must for the serious yoga student and any yoga teacher
