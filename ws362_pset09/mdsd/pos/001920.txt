If any other author had tried to handle this story, it would have fallen flat.  Convenient cases of amnesia are so unbelievable.  But Ms. Peters takes this in her stride, and still goes ahead and writes a good adventure story.  It is probably because of the strength of her characters that she can carry this off.  As unbelievable as the whole amnesia thing was, I found that I couldn't put the book down once I began.  I enjoyed it all, and not the least of which were Amelia and Emerson's son Ramses letters from home.  These were hilarious, and I couldn't get enough of them.  Ms. Peters has written a story that actually surprised me by the ending.  It's a whole lot of fun, and now, I can't wait until the next one.  These books are really addictive
