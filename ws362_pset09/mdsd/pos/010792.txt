When PI Tess Monoghan and her boyfriend, Crow befriend (a little unwillingly on Tess's part) Lloyd, a tough, black teenager from the ghettos of Baltimore, they put in motion a series of events which are connected with murder, drug dealing and extortion by people who should know better. Lloyd is living on the streets in a hand to mouth fashion, getting money for food from begging, scams and from skirting around the edges of a criminal element which uses young boys to do their dirty work. When the body of  Federal Attorney, Gregory Youssef is found, Agents begin digging to find connections with drug dealers and Lloyd clearly is frightened by the name of Youssef, even though he claims never to have met him. Tess, Crow and their families are threatened when crooked Federal agents try to locate Lloyd and so are forced to go into hiding and to call in favours from family and friends, to remain alive. It's an exciting, pacy read which fans of Tess Monoghan will thoroughly enjoy
