If you've read Josephus, Tacitus, etc. you already know the bare facts of the relationship between Jews and pagans (and also between both groups and early Christians).   Grant interprets these sources rather than adding new facts. 

So what makes Grant an invaluable resource?  He answers the all-important question: "What were these idiots thinking?"  Through well-informed speculation, Grant shows that what we may see as acts of complete stupidity were in fact choices that (although ultimately wrong) nevertheless had a rational basis.  For example: 

*Why did Antiochus IV oppress the Jews (thus triggering the Maccabean revolt that led to modern-day Hanukah celebrations?)  Grant explains that Antiochus was planning to make war on the Parthians, an empire that ruled Mesopotamia and Persia.  If he was to do so, he needed to keep Israel under control.  Unfortunately, Antiochus thought that by enforcing religious unity, he would create order - but in fact, he provoked a rebellion.

*Why were the Jews in Israel so willing to have Rome take over their nation at first?  Grant traces the long history of Roman-Israeli cooperation, beginning with the Maccabean wars.  During those wars, the Romans allied with the Maccabees in order to weaken Antiochus.   As part of this alliance, Romans and Jews not only agreed to support each other in war, but also agreed to guarantee freedom of worship for all Jews throughout the Roman empire and the lands of its allies.  So if Roman vassal King X oppressed the Jews in X-Land, the X-Land Jews complained to the Jews in Israeli (or directly to the Romans) who in turn made X stop hassling the local Jews.  Such protection was often necessary, because Greeks in nearby Greek cities often hated the Jews. (It is not quite clear why this is so; Grant speculates that relevant factors might have included (1) interpretations of Jewish dietary laws that meant that Jews refused to eat with Greeks and (2) Greek nationalists' resentment of Jews' good relationship with Romans, the occupying colonial power).  

Even after the Roman takeover of Israel, the vassal-kings of Israel often were able to work with the Romans to aid diaspora Jews.  For example, when Asian city governments forced Jews to appear in court on Sabbath and preventing them from subsidizing the Temple in Jerusalem, King Herod (who ruled during the time of Augustus) complained to the Romans, who intervened on the Jews' behalf.

*Why did the Herodian kingdom disintegrate?  King Herod began the problem by splitting his kingdom among three sons (with Roman acquiescence).  But the son who ruled over the core of Judaea was not politically deft, and splitting the kingdom insured that that king had less tax revenue than his richer neighbors.  So this king could barely afford to pay his soldiers, thus reducing his ability to keep order, thus causing the Romans to take over and run the place directly through governors.

*Why were Roman governors so incompetent?  Because Romans viewed Judaea as a third-class province, they sent men who had been at most mid-level bureaucrats.  By contrast, nearby governorships were filled by men who had been consuls (i.e. had significant experience running Rome itself).  

*Why was Roman taxation so oppressive?  Taxes were the same for every person or household rather than being proportional to income, so a tax that would be lenient to the rich would be oppressive to the poor. (Not being an economist, Grant does not make it clear why progressive or proportional taxation would have been impossible- but intuitively I suspect that it would have been more difficult to administer in a pre-industrial economy than a head tax).

*Why was the Jewish priesthoood unable to prevent rebellions against Rome? Because it was split. Priests were entitled to a percentage of the grain harvest, and the more aristocratic priests and the less aristocratic priests fought over grain distribution; Josephus asserts (perhaps hyperbolically, perhaps not) that poorer priests starved to death.  Eventually, the split over economics led to splits over nationalism and rebellion.

*Why did Romans hate Christians at the time of Nero, and even blame Christians for the Roman great fire of 64?  Grant points out that someone obstructed firefighting efforts, and that  early Christians believed that the Day of Judgment could come at any time and might involve a "fiery ordeal".  He then speculates that either (1) some Christians actually spread the fire to spur the final judgment, or (2) ignorant Romans misunderstood Christian views and THOUGHT that Christians did so.

*Why might the Jews in Israel have thought that a revolt against Rome would be successful? Grant speculates that just as the Jews were aided against Antiochus by Antiochus' enemy Rome, the Jews might have thought that they would be aided against Rome by Rome's enemy Parthia.  And in the absence of modern communication, they had no way of knowing what was really going on in Parthia.  (Unfortunately, Parthia had signed a peace treaty with Rome at about the time the rebellion started).

*What went wrong in the Judeo-Christian relationship?  Grant suggests that the early Gospels sought to blame the Jews for Jesus' death in order to avoid Roman oppression and to reassure Romans that the Christians played no part in the Jewish revolt of 66. 

*Why did Hadrian (an emperor regarded as wise and humane in Roman history, but undoubtedly the worst emperor ever from the Jewish point of view) ban circumcision in the 130s, thus leading to another Jewish revolt? 

Grant sketches out the positive features of Hadrian's world view: rather than viewing residents of places like Judaea as Roman subjects, he viewed them as equal components of a great Roman commonwealth.  But it logically followed from this that Hadrian would demand more uniformity than would prior Roman rulers.  

Also, Romans (like Jews) had always viewed self-mutilation as disgusting.  But because Romans (unlike Jews) lacked a tradition of circumcision, Hadrian may have seen the ban on circumcision as a pretty small step from existing bans on castration.  Grant's view is bolstered by the fact that the ban on circumcision applied to all Roman subjects, not just Jews; other nearby peoples, such as Phoenicians, practiced the custom of circumcision.  

*Why did Jews think the revolt of the 130s might succeed? Again, Jews may have thought that Parthia would help out.  Also, Rabbi Akiva, the leading sage who supported the rebellion, was over 90 and perhaps his judgment was a bit impaired.

*Why did Romans tolerate the continued existence of Judaism after the second revolt?  Grant notes that Yavne, the leading center of Jewish scholarship, was under Roman control throughout the rebellion.  Perhaps Jewish colloborators in Yavne protected Jews outside the rebellious areas. 

As a result, pagan emperors after Hadrian were more lenient: although they banned conversions to Judaism (a serious impediment, of course, to Judaism's long term future) they otherwise did not hassle Jews.  In the 200s, Elagabalus (an otheriwse nasty emperor) possessed a sufficently pro-Jewish reputation that he was accused by detractors of undergoing circumcision.  And by allowing Jews to establish a patriarchate in Tiberias, Rome allowed Jewry to essentially establish a new capital
