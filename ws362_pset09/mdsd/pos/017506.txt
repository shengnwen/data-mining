I loved iWOZ. I enjoyed every single page. It was like a portal to another world -- the world of inventor Steve Wozniak. Its conversational tone makes me feel like I'm right beside him. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting inside the head of one of the greatest inventors of our time
