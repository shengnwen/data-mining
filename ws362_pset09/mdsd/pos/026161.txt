Reading once again 'Old Man And The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway was simply a joyful reading experience that will stay with me for a very long time.  The writing is eloquent yet raw.  The reader experience humble yet filled with sheer power.  The connectivity is filled with singularity yet there is a sense of one with the universe. 

There is of course so much that has been written and said about 'Old Man And The Sea' that I will not write a commentary about this marvelous book's movement; however, what I will say is this: there are books that are indeed worth returning to since they have a timelessness to the story, and, as the reader's own life experience grows, so too does the appreciation and understandings of the written story.  In this compelling book, I have found that the meaning of this story so powerful and connected to my soul in few ways a book ever has.

Do yourself a favor, go pick up 'Old Man And The Sea' and enjoy yourself.  Though you may be holding a paperbook in your hand, you may soon come to realize your actually holding a mirrow, and you're peering into your own life
