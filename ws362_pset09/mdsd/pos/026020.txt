I've been working with graphics for about 5 years, using an abstracted library.  When I had to take over the library, this book provided me an excellent introduction to the use of OpenGL.  This book is very good for learning how to use OpenGL, and specific commands, and is presented in a relatively logical order.  I keep a copy of this on my bookshelf next to a copy of the OpenGL Super Bible, which is a little better as a pure reference guide.  Between the two (and MSDN) I can figure out pretty much any problem, one way or another
