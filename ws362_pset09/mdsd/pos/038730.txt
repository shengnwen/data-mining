My 3 year old son loves this book.  The story is easy to follow and has that repetitive style that small children love.  The battle between the sneeky bunnies and Mr McGreely is great, and builds to a very amusing ending.  I have read this story every night now for the past 3 months and I am sure that I will be reading it for at least another 3 - Muncha, Muncha, Muncha
