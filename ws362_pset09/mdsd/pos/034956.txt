If you have any interest in the Partisan movement, the Jewish resistance, the Warsaw uprising, the White rose, Edelweiss Pirates, Oskar Schindler or anyone else that defied the nazi regime, you have to read this book. First off, this is not a bang bang shoot em up account of the Bielski brothers. This is more about the massive effort it took to move over 800 people-quietly- thru a forest crawling with thousands of Nazis whose only purpose was to find them. Truly, an amazing feat of logistics that can be marvelled at, but then to think that they did it more than once?!?! Unbelievable!

If you didnt know any better, you'd swear it was a work of fiction, moreover, after reading it, you are going to wonder why on earth are our children not taught about such brave souls! truly one of the more memorable and gripping books I have read in quite a while. get it, you will not be sorry.
