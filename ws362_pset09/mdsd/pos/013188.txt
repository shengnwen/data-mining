Partnoy was a Morgan Stanley derivatives salesman who burned his bridges right at the start of his career with a tell-all book that couldn't quite tell all.  He's no Michael Lewis, but he has adapted his exclusion to a useful role as an ivory tower intellectual opining on the world of derivatives, and is influential.  It's a good book that makes several important points.  It's written at the highest possible level in terms of assuming reader understanding, which I liked.  However, I think some of his conclusions are unduly alarmist, and I wonder whether it will end up confusing some readers who don't know where to take the grains of salt
