I must admit that I have not read much of Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, so this is my actual first exposure to his perceptions.  After reading the reviews before me I can understand what those people were getting stressed from in his way of translating the information.  

However, I did find that the timing in which I bought this CD was Inspired!  It did help me refocus and bring my self back into a more postive light.  So I would have to say it worked.  

There were some things that I squirmed internally.  When he refered to himself as the reincarnation of St. Francis, was one of them. I do not know if it is true or not but it didn't seem to be relevant or help his position in any way.

I did appreciate that he did seem to acknowledge that his life was not always perfect and he did have his bad moments. 

I really appreciated that.  

But the concept that he was attempting to get across was to tell the personal stories of inspiration that have happened to him and give us reference points to fall back on and find within inspiration within our own life.

I truly enjoyed the concepts and it did make me think.  That is what a good author does.

I also appreciated his support and call for help as Ram Das is in his dying process.  This showed great compassion and it touched my heart.

All and all it was definately worth it
