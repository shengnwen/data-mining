I didn't think it was going to be this good.

Zuckoff paints a brilliant picture of the life of Ponzi the man who came up with one of the first and most incredible pyramid schemes in history.

The book of course is a tragedy. Ponzi made some people a lot of money, caused a lot of people to lose money and went from great wealth to poverty in rollercoaster ride time.

The book is a fascinating study for those interested in business, persuasion and a great reminder that what sounds too good to be true, probably is. 

Ponzi is painted as having been a complex character that knew what he was doing...knew it was wrong...knew it would ultimately collapse, but was not without heart and caring for some.

A truly well written and page turner of a book.
