Nicky was no sucker, and his life story as told here (he is currently in his 70s) shows that he never looked back on his life in regret.  Unlike some criminals who write books full of self-loathing and pleas for forgiveness, Nicky's book reads like a mix between a gangsta novel and a criminal operations manual.  Indeed, this will likely become one of the most widely read books among anyone interested in intricacies of thug life, and will be right at home on the shelf next to your Scarface DVD.  On the other hand, smart law enforcement agents and scholars should also grab a copy as it is more insightful and certainly more interesting than most books out there on organized crime logistics.  Controversial, entertaining, and yet highly educational- does it get any better than that?
