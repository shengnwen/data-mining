It is estimated that every day we are subjected to ~3,000 "interruption"-based marketing messages - on TV, the internet, magazines, radio, billboards, newspapers, etc. [Must be true: I counted 120 display advertisements in a typical morning edition of my local newspaper in the sections I normally peruse - this doesn't include the classified or the additional "advertising package".] Permission marketing seeks to engage customers in a more comfortable, step-wise process and develop a relationship over time. "Opt-In" options for email newsletters are an example of this process. 

This book is an excellent source to gain an introduction to permission-based marketing approaches - and to challenge your thinking if you are operating with a traditional "interruption"-based marketing strategy today.
