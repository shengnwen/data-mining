I recieved this book for Christmas and I found this book very much to my liking.  I love New York, and I plan to move from this small, country town someday and move there, this book has truly motivated me to do so.  E.B. White describes New York so well, I feel I am there.  Learning about New Yorks past is very interesting.  Though I found something terribly ironic on page 54 about the destruction of New York City.  I was wondering if anyone else that has read the book picked up on it? And, if so, do you understand or even believe that this was written? It is remarkable, not a good remarkable, but more like strange that this was written 51 years before September 11.  If anyone else has noticed this please respond. Thanks, and read thsi book, its a must if you love New York and History and even E.B. White, I totally recommend it, its very clear, descriptive and a fast read
