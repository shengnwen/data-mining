Not only does Swedenborg's Heaven &amp; Hell provide rational answers to the question, &quot;What is this life and this world all about anyway?&quot; but it also gives us the combination to unlock the door to happiness.  What's more, one of Swedenborg's central statements is that EVERYONE may choose to enter into heavenly happiness.        This is incredible!  The choices we make in our daily lives, whether from loving or hateful motives, are an expression of the ultimate choice we will make about what kind of place we wish to dwell for eternity.  The further implications of this idea is that as we form our lives by the choices that we make, we can choose to become more and more &quot;heavenly happy,&quot; right here, right now, if we apply the ideas in Swedenborg's book to our lives today.        I found these concepts to be inspirational and informative, a book that could be read over and over, always discovering some new gem of wisdom
