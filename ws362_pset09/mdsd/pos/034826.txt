Wolf Moon was the best inspirational story I've ever read. This was my first time reading one of Charles De Lint's books and it won't be the last. Charles De Lint created a work of art.The dark setting was suited for the werewolf setting.The way that Charles De Lint incorparated a love story in such a dark setting was amazing. I think there were too many good people who died in this book There was a couple of parts that started to drag but overall is was an excellent book
