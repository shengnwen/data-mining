Hadn't read anything in the 'cyber punk' genre before, and still don't think that's the right name. Regardless, a good read. Kept me hooked all the way through. Even my husband read it (yeah, quite a feat). Besides, the Metaverse is something I think we're headed towards in the very near future. 

Funny and quick, I would recommend this to anyone interested in something different
