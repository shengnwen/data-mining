The rollicking memoir recounts Guthrie's coming of age among the hardscrabble farms, boomtowns, labor camps, and hobo jungles of early 20th century America. The book contains many vivid and visceral images of cruelty, madness, courage, and joy, tracing Guthrie's boyhood in Oklahoma to his early days of travelling the country by freight train, with his guitar slung across his back. 

Guthrie's winning down-home voice can at times seem affected, falsely ingenuous, and it seems a shame that he doesn't address politics more directly in the book, given his sophistication and close involvement in the labor movement of the Depression.

But overall, a fun and spirited read
