I'm not a big Robert Heinlein fan, but my wife suggested "Double Star" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's one of Heinlein's novels for juveniles, and it is straightforward and thought-provoking without being simplistic or preachy. It can be enjoyed at face value, but you can pull quite a bit of interesting psychological and socio-political concepts from it as well. Although set in the future when humans have colonized various parts of the solar system, the focus is not on science at all. Unfortunately this makes it all the more jarring when occasional references are made to slide rules and microfilm
