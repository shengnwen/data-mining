Found the guide really good for sites to see, restaurants + hotel bookings ... the all important shopping section was excellent but didn't mentione that non US residents can avail of discounts in most of the large department stores by registering with the customer service desks ... the 2 and 4 day itineraries ensured that we hit all the must sees ... used it in conjunction with some top tips from Trip Advisors fact sheet on Chicago. Also had good advice on days trips in the greater Chicago vacinity.
