AT MY AGE 60+ I MISSED THE WAR, YET THIS BOOK FROM THE DIARY OF A YOUNG (29 yrs) OLD GERMAN GENERAL STAFF OFFICER IS BY FAR THE BEST I HAVE READ.  NOT ENTERTAINING, BUT HISTORY RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDST OF ACTION AND BEHIND THE SCENES IN VARIOUS HQ WHERE THE WAR PLANNING WAS BEING DONE.  HE SHOWS HOW THEY BEGAN TO REALIZE WHAT A MADMAN HITLER WAS, THE SS GONE BERZERK WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF IN THE REICHSTEIG, AND HIS MANY WOUNDS TAKING HIM HOME TO LEIPZIG WHERE HE MET, MARRIED, AND LATER HAD 2 CHILDREN ALL  ( DURING ) THE WAR. HE TELLS OF HITLER'S FINAL FEW DAYS AND THE SURRENDER TO THE RUSSIANS OF WHOM THEY WERE ALL (CIVILIANS ESPECIALLY ) AFRAID OF. "BETTER TO DIE" SOME THOUGHT -THAN FALL INTO RUSSIAN HANDS. THEY KNEW THE ALLIES WERE KINDER AND NOT SO BRUTAL ON SURVIVORS.   A  FASCINATING TALE, TRUE, AND TOLD IN A  VERY  READABLE  MANNER / WRITING.   Five **** Stars from this - Brother in Christ Jesus
