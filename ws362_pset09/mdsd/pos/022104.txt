I read this book when it first came out, when it was a bestseller.  I enjoyed it then, but had a snobby attitude that only Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Faulkner existed as writers at that time, being young and supremely critical about everything.  I still don't think it's a work of great genius, but it has a minimalist style that is very clear and never waivers in its "voice."  Levin is definitely a master of this.  And with his short, concise sentences, he builds the suspense.  The book is a creepy, guilty pleasure.  The film, by Polanski, is true to the book except, as another reviewer has said here, for the ending, which would have made the movie even better, I think.  I listened to the audio book with Mia Farrow reading.  Perfect.  If you haven't heard it, check it out.  It's lots of fun
