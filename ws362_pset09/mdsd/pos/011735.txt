Rare that one picks up a text as this and wants to read it cover to cover but in fact that is exactly what happened to me when I cracked this jewel open.  I was just browsing at my university's medical bookstore and stumbled upon this invaluable text with a potent array of well documented, well footnoted, authoritative sources.  

If you are a medical professional, member of an allied profession (e.g., MFT's who deal with drug counseling, et cetera), or just a member of the public wishing to become more informed, this book is a solid resource to add to your library.  Inaba facilitates this learning process by providing a full explanation of how psychoactive substances evolved historically, how they exist both illegitimately and legitimately in society contemporaneously, and of course how the substances actually affect the human organism on the molecular and physiological level.

In short, if you were forced to buy only one text on the subject matter, this would be the one without doubt
