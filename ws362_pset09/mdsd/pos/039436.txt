Her neighbor's apparent suicide haunts Dr. Rebecca Butterman, who feels that since she is a counselor, she should have seen the signs. Perhaps this is, in part, why she agreed to investigate when the victim's mother did not believe her daughter took her own life. Despite opposition and danger, Rebecca persists, uncovering some ugly truths in the process. While the truth can set you free, the good doctor has to worry if death and freedom will prove to be synonyms. 

**** This is an excellent mystery, with engaging characters and is clearly well researched. Rebecca is a good narrator with a sympathetic voice and on target insights. There is subtle humor, balancing out the suspense, and the finale is one that you probably will not see coming. ***
