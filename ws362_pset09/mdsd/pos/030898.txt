There are a lot of books out there that try to tell you how to make money in the stock market.  This one accomplishes something else.  By giving quite a bit of history of market performance and explaining why stocks performed as they did over multiple time periods, Siegel gives the reader a basis for understanding how and why stocks respond to different inputs.

Stocks for the Long Run ends up being a great book to start with for someone who is just beginning to invest in stocks, or for someone who has had a tough go of investing in stocks and is looking to re-ground themselves in the realities of stocks.  Siegel does a very nice job of setting realistic return expectations, showing the power of stocks over the long-term and giving guidance on portfolio construction.

This book doesn't give much guidance at all on how to select individual stocks, but that isn't its intent.  Instead, it makes a compelling argument for the asset class of stocks in general and lets you know what you can expect as a stock investor.

Well-written and a great background for any aspiring stock investor.
