I have to admit the length of Wally Lamb's I Know This Much Is True was a bit daunting but once I finally started the reading I could not put it down. Though the story jumps around quite a bit between story lines and periods in the lives of the characters, it was never difficult to follow. The story was wonderful and it becomes more evident as I continue to read other books, the writing of I Know This Much Is True is truly amazing. It has convinced me to reread She's Come Undone and I am looking forward to more by Wally Lamb
