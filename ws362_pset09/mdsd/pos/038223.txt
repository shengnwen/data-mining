The passionate, sexy couple in this novel aren't Gilbert and Anne, even though they are newlyweds. It's handsome Owen Ford and the beautiful Leslie Moore who are passionately in love. They are one hot, gorgeous couple--in fact, they make Anne and Gilbert seem dull, bland and boring by comparison!
  Both Leslie and Owen are renegades--non-conformists who follow their own rules and live by their wits. They've both been hurt and disillusioned by the world around them. But they're also idealists who secretly desire love--and when they first met, the sexual attraction is so intense you can almost feel it through the pages of the book! This attraction grows stronger and Owen eventually decides his love for the married Leslie is wrong--so he tragically leaves town, assuming he will never see her again. By an odd twist of fate, Leslie eventually becomes a "free woman" and they reunite. The passion and desire felt between them is beautifully written--and it's extremely sensual for a book first published in 1917.
By comparison, Anne and Gilbert are the boring married couple who are settled in their ways. We are even treated to their "first fight." Lucy Maud Montgomery admired men who were creative free-thinkers and non-conformists---both Owen Ford and another favorite--Barney Snaith of "The Blue Castle"--fit this description perfectly. Unfortunately Gilbert doesn't even come close. As the tiny town's physician, he has become self-righteous and uptight. Lucy  Maud stopped making Gilbert interesting after her second "Anne" book and he's basically a non-entity from there on. But you won't say that about Owen!
