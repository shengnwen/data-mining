I personally loved this book although it was quite dissapointing that leafpool and Crowfeather broke up!! I hope they get back toghether in sunset!! It was also really sed that Cinderpelt died although I kinda expected it because of how she made leafpool medicine cat! I was really hoping for more romance thgough! Overall I loved the book and warriors fans like me will probably love it too.
