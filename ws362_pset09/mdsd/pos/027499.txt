Heartwarming story of the loving bond between a woman and her beloved pet dog.  The consistency and strength of the bond is a true testimony to the value of unconditional love, the fact it lasts forever, and the potential for inherent pain.  Saw myself in every page, and the loving bond I have shared with my pets.  Most recently: the sharing of life and love with my Boston Terrier, Boomerang,,,, then the shattering pain of loss and grief. And finally, a spiritual resolution, loving acceptance and ultimate joy.   Arlene Millman, author of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGYJ (The tale of a remarkable Boston Terrier)
