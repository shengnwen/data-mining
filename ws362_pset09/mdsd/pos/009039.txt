With the more frequent and earlier detection and treatment of prostate cancer in men, the diminished sexual capacity that accompanies treatment for the disease is affecting an increasing number of people.

The basic point of this book is: A couple's love-life does not have to end with impotence or reduced sexual capacity. If a couple is determined to have a satisfying sex life in spite of physcial limitations, this book will show them how.

"Intimacy with Impotence" is written by a couple for couples.  With a minimum of preaching it deals with the physical, emotional, and psychological challenges accompanying impotence and gives practical advice on overcoming them.  As a survivor of prostate cancer disease myself, I can highly recommend this book.
