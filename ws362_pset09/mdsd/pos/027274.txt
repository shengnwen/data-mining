This is one of the earliest and still one of the best introductions to socio-historical psychology, the study of how individual human intelligence develops in interaction with people and the environment.  In concert with  many contemporary approaches in cognitive science today, Lev Vygotsky, A.R.  Luria and A.N. Leontiev argued that human intelligence is  characteristically mediated through objects and social activity.  Humans  think through tools.  Talking to oneself, for example, is not an irrelevant  activity.  Putting one's actions into speech is a way of focusing one's  consciousness on the problem.  This kind of speech is not pointless, but  rather a cognitive tool that gives one a greater awareness of one's own  actions and makes it easier to modify these actions--a point that Vygotsky  proved with research on how children solved problems.  Much of human  activity involves making use of tools, signs, and activities, the kinetic  melodies of action and conceptualization  that make us smart, and through  which we are able to accomplish the uniquely human feats of complex  intellectual action. This is an excellent place to begin studying Vygotsky  and activity theory.  If you like this you will also like A.R. Luria's *The  Making of Mind*, and the classics *The Man With A Shattered World* and *The  Mind of a Mnemonist*, the books that inspired Oliver Sacks' writing
