Berry is a prophet somewhat in the mold of Amos from the Hebrew Bible, though a bit more disarming in his challenges.  His selection of Jesus-sayings on peacemaking is intriguing for what it reveals both about what Jesus said and about Berry.  The book is worth the price for the introduction and the essay, "The Burden of the Gospels," that are included.

In the concluding essay, he suggests that a more honest reading of the Gospels could improve the modern practice of the Christian faith.

Anyone who seeks to take seriously the Gospels and the Jesus they present, should read the above referenced essay.  It was first presented in August 2005 at the joint convocation of Lexington Theological Seminary and Baptist Seminary of Kentucky, two institutions that share space in Lexington, Kentucky.  Berry's essay has an important word for all readers and interpreters of the Gospels--be they in the pew or in the pulpit
