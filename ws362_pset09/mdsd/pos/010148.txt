This is an indispensable, pocket guide for identifying Lionel Trains at train shows. It's easy to use and obviously handy because it slips easily into a back pocket. I use the pricing only as a way of identifying general area of value. Any one item could be worth more or less. Guide is great for keeping track of train items you own or are looking for
