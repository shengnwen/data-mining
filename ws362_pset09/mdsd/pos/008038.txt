What I like about this book is the author's upfront honesty.  this is a book about magickal theory and exploring your dark side.  The author never sets out to do a book that's focused on practice.  He wants you to critically think and explore the concepts that he touches on, but in a manner that I believe gives a lot of respect to the reader
