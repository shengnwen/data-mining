I just finished reading this unauthorized biography about Yoko Ono. I found it to be an enjoyable, easy read.  

There are few biographies specifically about Yoko, and some of the material out there is annoying to read (such as Woman) or mention Yoko in passing as part of a bioigraphy about her famous husband, Lennon (such as the Goldman trash book). This book is devoted entirely to Yoko, although the second half mentions Lennon quite a bit.

Unlike some books which are clearly vindictive, this seems to be a rather balanced, impartial book, although it does portray Yoko as self centered, bossy and overly driven to succeed. This is my favorite book about Yoko and one of my favorite biographies in general.

The only negative points I feel worth mentioning is that there are very few photographs, and the ending of the book (if you can call it that) leaves the reader hanging in mid air.  The book does not really have a summation or conclusion. It just ends. If the ending were better, I probably would have given this book 5 stars
