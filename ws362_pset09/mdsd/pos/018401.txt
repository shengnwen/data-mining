As a person with a spoiled, but highly intelligent and loving Golden Retreiver, I found this book to be very helpful.  My dog Grizzly pretty much got what he wanted.  This has changed after reading the book and watching the Dog Whisperer on TV.  The change was my attitude. Cesar shows you how to change.  Since I watch the TV program, I had doubts about getting the book.  I'm glad I bought it.  It not only gives you much more insight into your dog, but is also a wonderful story about Cesar himself.  He is an American Success story come true.  My husband who won't watch the tv program or read the book struggles to get Grizzly to do what he wants.  I have much better results.  This book should also be read by people contemplating owning a dog.  One of the things he says in it is that you have to walk your dog a minimun of an hour a day - every day.  I highly recommend this book
