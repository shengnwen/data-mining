Winn is currently a History Professor at Tufts University (added the link to his office below) but at the time he began the research for this book he was completing his doctorate at Cambridge University. It is an interesting read, mostly documented with interviews with workers at the mill themselves. Winn gives good insight into the history of the mill itself and in doing so carefully explains the Chilean political class structure and the generational differences between the less politicized older workers and the more vocal younger workers. 

His main thesis, is essentially that Allende was to cautious in believing that he could appease the Christian Democratic faction of the Popular Unity coalition and instead should have embraced the calls from his own Socialist Party faction to immediately turn over factories to workers. While one may disagree with his perspective, there is no doubt that this work should be read by people from all political stripes if they want a detailed work into the politics within the PU government and grassroots activism in Chile during the Allende years.
