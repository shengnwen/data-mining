I got my first copy of this book about 30 years ago. It starts you off very slowly, letting your muscles stretch gradually. The short, daily meditation makes your mind feel refreshed after doing the exercises. I have given away and re-ordered many copies of this book, and will always have a copy in my house. It is absolutely the best beginner's guide to yoga in the world!
