i don't know what the other reviewer was going thru, but it may have something to do with the fact that this book will honestly tell you if your LDR has a shot of making it. the author knows her stuff... if you take the distance factor out of your relationship, is what you're left with a strong union in the first place?? if not, you may not make it. if you do, it's a very good sign. ladies, get this book. it's helped me so much and i've been in my LDR for almost 2 years. it is an easy read, which is great... and the helpful hints and tips make a lot of sense. highly recommend
