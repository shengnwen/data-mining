It was interesting and empowering because it echoed what goes through women's minds.  Maybe we wouldn't have made the same choices that this woman did but it was refreshing to read a book where a woman made exotic choices, lived through them and became strengthened in the end.

This book is a worthwhile read for those who are interested in seeing a woman lose herself in order to find herself
