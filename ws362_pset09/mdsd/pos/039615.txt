I actually enjoyed Shutterbabe.  I thought her nickname for herself was actually cute.  Some comments have focused on disliking how the author wrote about her love/bed interests too much and her leaving photography in the end as a knock against feminism that some felt like she harped about.  

For me however, the title says its all--  Shutterbabe:  Adventures in Love and War.  As someone who knows next to nothing about the technical aspects of photography, this book gave me some new basic knowledge about different equipment, photography as a career, and the dangerous, yet exhilaring adventures of photography. Yet the author choose to write about all aspects of her life, not just photography and I'm glad for that.  If the book had focused solely on her photography (no love life, no family, no friends) I would have been bored stiff.  

I also enjoyed this book because each chapter focused on some kind of historical event that I either had no knowledge of or knew little about.  I was either too young to remember or just ignorant of the war and events in Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Romania, and Russia.  Although the information in these chapters aren't nearly enough to truely understand these events, it does give readers some new information based on her experiences.  

My only complaint is her last chapter and afterword.  I lost some interest for the book at this point.  The end switches to her new career in television, her reflections on what she misses about photography, her husband, and her children.  Instead of going on and on for 40 pages, I thought the book would have ended stronger just with a quick afterword summarizing her life.
