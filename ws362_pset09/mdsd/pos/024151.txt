I was looking to introduce my 3.5 year old and 5.5 year old to chapter books "with out pictures"(!!!).  I chose Pippi Longstocking as our first book.  They loved it!  They were excited to go to bed each night, ready for the light to go off and mommy or daddy to read to them with a flash light.  I reccomend this book, even for 3 year olds.  

I did have to change a few of the words so they would know what I was talking about, but there was no problem
