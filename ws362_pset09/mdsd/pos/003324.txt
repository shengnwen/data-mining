Then this is the one.  I've started four businesses and still found much to learn from Stathis' book.   It is the single most comprehensive guide to getting funded and getting started.  Worth many times the price.  I've coached nine teams through start-up and crafter 28 "SmartPartnering" campaigns to leverage the visibility and the value of existing firms and this is the first book I recommend to people in both groups.  Many buy a shorter book instead but the one that gets the strongest reviews from those who do read it is this one.  - Kare Anderson, author of SmartPartnering and other book
