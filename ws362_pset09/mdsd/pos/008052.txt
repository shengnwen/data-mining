This was a great book.  I love the way the Sisters told history from thier personal experiences. They also showed how even if you live for 100 years or more you learn a little more about your self every day.  This books also shows how anyone can achieve anything if they have a strong foundation instilled in them no matter what they incounter or experience.  Although I do think at times the sisters were a little condescending and arogant towards other african american who did not have the same upbring as they did.  The Delany Sisters were blessed with opportunities many african-americans at that time did not have and were not going to have.  I felt they were just a little to judgemental towards them for not having the same quality of life as the Delanys.
