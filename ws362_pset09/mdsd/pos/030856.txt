Irving sits in a cell in Austria,a 
shamelees little United Nations con-
trolled little Alps country with no 
freedom of speech! This first book by
Irving is about Allied War Crimes. Yes,
Mr. and Mrs. America they do exist. Just
look what George W. Hilter is doing to
Iraq today! A great and tragic book. Mr.
Irving is to be commended
