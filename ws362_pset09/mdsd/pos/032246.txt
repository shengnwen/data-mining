I had been looking for a "family" friendly cookbook that included recipes with basic ingredients but was healthy, and included recipes that can be cooked within a reasonable amount of time and would appeal to adults and kids.  This cookbook has great variety, ideas, and should be a part of any family's cookbook collection!
