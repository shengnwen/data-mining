I think this is probably the best book on economics for the layman I have ever read. I have just finished reading the book which I had checked out from the library. I had such a hard time putting this book down that I was up until 4:00am this morning just to finish it.

If there is only one book in economics you ever read this should be it. I plan to buy multiple copies of this book to give them away to my friends
