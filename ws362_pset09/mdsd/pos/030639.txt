Books about EQ seem to fall into three categories: (1) High level concepts about the topic with platitudes about how to develop it, (2) Dense academic research, and (3) Emotional outpourings from the author about their own experience.  This book is clearly in category 2.

I have found this a helpful reference text and I review it from time to time to gather additional "nuggets" to share in presentations/workshops
