While the book provides some really great inspiration and ideas to add to your sexual repertoire, some of the way-too-many synonyms and descriptive words used for male and female anatomy provided not only giggles, but enough adjectives for 8 or 9  romance novels..  Honestly, "Love Rocket, Shivering Member, Celestial Dragon, Healing / Royal Sceptor, Magic Wand, Warrior Weapon, Love Organ, Cobra, Stalk, Untamed Animal..." to list a few.
  Definitely a book worth reading and referring back to for those in stagnant relationships needing a sexual boost - or even those new to sexual relationships...
