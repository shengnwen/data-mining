Well I have had Casino Royale sitting in my room for probably 3 or 4 years. I still remember picking it up at B&N, because it looked like something that would be cool, since it was James Bond. Forgotten on the book shelf I didn't even think about it until I saw Casino Royale in theaters back in November, and started hearing all these comparisons to how the movie screwed the book up so badly. So I figured I'd find out for myself. And boy were they right, granted the first novel of the famous James Bond series was not quite as exciting as the movies, or as I hear the other novels are. The book however is still an amazing read. You can really see how Bond's character is shaping to be what we all know and love. 

Now this novel is definately a little on the slow side as far as action goes, but it does have its high points with attempted assassinations, torture, and killings. You know, what you would expect from a "00" agent. I really can't wait to read more of Ian Fleming's work, and I really do think that any Bond fan should really read these fantastic novels. For me, it was like a new experience for Bond, because I was expecting the same thing that I see in the movies. However, the character is much more developed and compelling when he is written. 

So if you are a fan of the Bond movies and love to read; than this is the novel for you
