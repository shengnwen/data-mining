This little book was an interesting read, however, it should be taken with a grain of salt. One of the fifty things you're not supposed to know is that 10,000 people die from legal drugs every year. I would have prefered a follow up that explains 13,000 die because they can not get access to treatments that could save their lives because the FDA said "no, not until it is approved." All in all it is a good coffee table book
