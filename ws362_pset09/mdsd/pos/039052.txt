The complete and unabridged text of the biblical "Book of Psalms" is superbly read by Alex Jennings, whose resume includes lead performances for Royal Shakespeare Company productions, and enhanced with English choral music from the 16th and 17th centuries. The 150 Psalms are narrated in the language of the King James Bible; among the Psamls are well-known, inspirational verses; darker lines about punishment and revenge; and some oddly indulgent writings that appear to be focused upon David. A singularly valuable resource for anyone striving to intimately acquaint themselves with the Psalms and understand their emotional expression. 4 CDs, approx. 5 hours 17 min.
