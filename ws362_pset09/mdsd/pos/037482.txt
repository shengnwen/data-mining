As heart rate monitors become more sophisticated in function, but less complicated (and less costly) for the user, the need for sport-specific expertise is needed.  Sally Edwards and Sally Reed address this need in two fundamental ways, but miss it in a third.  First, the authors do a superb job of defining terms and explaining the basics of heart rate training.  Second, the indoor and outdoor workouts offer most cyclists  variety designed to achieve goals, whether those are in terms of fitness or performance. So far, so good.  Unfortunately, the sample CD-ROM did little for me.  There was no associated manual or accessable on-line explanation.  The spreadsheet format seemed more compatable to downloadable monitors, rather than manual entry.  I finally gave up.  Too much data, too little information.  However, this was an extra (free) feature that should not detract from the overall quality of the book
