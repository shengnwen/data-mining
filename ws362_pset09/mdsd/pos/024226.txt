Well written band based on historical sources this is probably the best biography of the Prophet Muhammad that you can buy.  Mr Lings has been criticized by some Muslims of the Salafi/Wahabbi school of thought (Bilal Philips to name one) who were critical of a number of points in the book.  Mostly on the passage where he says on the conquest on Mecca when all images inside the Kaba were erased Muhammad placed a protective hand over that of Abraham.  He does point out in the footnotes that according to other sources all images were removed so I do not understand why Mr Philips was so critical of him.

The book is extreamly well written and covers all of the historical details of Muhammads life including events leading up to his birth and a brief history of Mecca.  

Highly recomended for anyone who seriously wants to know about the Muslim religion
