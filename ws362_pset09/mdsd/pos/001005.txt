Every now and then you read a book that lasts through life...I read this book at age 15 or so and my sister then about 17 read it also...over the years we have found ourselves referring to this book for some or other  reason. I think of it often  and spent years looking for a copy of it,  eventually finding one on a trash and treasure book stall. The way the  author described both the main character and the lifestyle have remained  etched permanently in my mind. The part where Lucas gets lost on a camping  trip was for me a particularly special part of the book, describing the  intrinsic human need for company, care and support....excellent book, a  must for the book shelf...i haven't read it recently and do not know it it  would have the same effect on me as it did in my developing years..
