First of all, I'd like to say that at this point, it doesn't matter if Mumia is guilty or innocent because the fact is, in this country we have something called Procedural Law, which mandates that if certain rules and guidelines are abused in a criminal trial, the case/charges at hand should be dropped. That is precisely what happend in Mumia's case. If you read this book (or any article about Mumia for that matter,) it's clear that the rights afforded to any prisoner were violated in his case and that the violations of procedure were so great that his case should be dropped and he should be freed, regardless of anything else.

Having said that, here is the book review. If you're looking for musings on the day-to-day existence of any given prisoner in any state or federal prison in the country, this is where to look. In addition to that, if you're looking for some interesting and rather shocking statistics regarding racial disparity in the justice system as a whole, espeically the death penalty (even though they are over a decade old, they are even more bleak today,) then this book is where to look. Reading this book forces one to question the validity, necessity, and practicality of the death penalty in this country as juxtaposed to other countries. Upon completion (actually way before that) of this book, you can't help but feel for Mumia and the way he has been treated by the nation that proclaims itself to be the model that other countries of the world should strive to immitate--OUR country.

Finally, I recommend this book to anyone interested at all by the undeniable fact of racial prejudice in the justice system. While this book reads like a collection of essays and journal entires, because that's what it is, if you're looking for a non-fiction account of the death penalty and death row in a novelized form, look into Dead Man Walking by Helen Prejean. Either way, Live from Death Row will open your eyes... and your heart.
