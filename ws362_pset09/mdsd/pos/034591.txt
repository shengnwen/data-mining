While I have to agree that this book was well organized and really fun to look at, I have an issue with the color charts in the back.  The colors are way off ( as to be expected when printed), but disappointing anyway.  My advice- after exploring the historic color schemes presnted in the book, take a ride down to your local Sherwin Williams paint store and get the paint samples there.  They offer a variety of colors - as well as the color swatches presented in this book.
