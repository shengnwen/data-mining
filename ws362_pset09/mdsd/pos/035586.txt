I first came accross the principle of Energy Density as I was reading a book by Rick Gallup called "The GI (Glycemic Index) Diet". In it he mentioned a food pyramid by the Mayo Clinic which ranked food groups according to energy density. He also said that the best way to apply it was to divide our plate into three sections. Fill half the plate with low carbohydrate vegetables, one quarter of the plate with a dense carbohydrate serving, and one quarter of the plate with a protein selection. I have followed this principle for a number of years and as a result have lost nearly 80 pounds.

Barbara Rolls, the author of this book, did some of the original research on Energy Density for Penn State. Her books tell how to calculate the energy density of a food. Take the calories in the serving and divide by the grams. This gives the calories per gram. An alternative is to divide the calories by the ounces in the serving size. This gives the calories per ounce. Using this technique it is easy to determine the energy density of a food as both the calories and the grams are posted on every food level. For natural foods, they calories and grams can be looked up on the USDA Nutrient Data Base at [...].

Energy Density is one of the most important principles in weight management. By selecting the right foods we can increase the volume of food that we eat while at the same time lowering calories
