This collection of fairy tales is great--it's not dominated by stories from Europe as is every other collection of &quot;Fairy Tales from Around the World&quot;. It truly is a worldwide collection. Her heroines do all  kinds of things in all kinds of ways. Ragan hasn't toed the line of  political correctness--she lets the world's cultures and their women speak  for themselves.  The heroines in this wonderful collection aren't anemic  passive beauties --they have character and blood. Ragan has enriched the  word &quot;heroine&quot; and has given my daughters hopes in all kinds of  new directions. As we read these stories together it was like taking a trip  around the world and in each new country we were invited to sit down by the  fire and listen to what makes the local hearts beat and to feel the  resonance of our common humanity. I like Ragan's short commentaries at the  end of each story because they gave me background information that helped  me tell my daughters a  little about the cultures from which the stories  came. They also clearly revealed an emotional center of each story.  I  can't wait for Ragan's next book
