This book is part of the Leaders in Action series, which means it is not a typical biography.  These books are usually written in three parts, each one focusing on the life, the character, and the legacy of the subject, in this case, Anne Bradstreet.  

The book does describe her life, but more importantly, her views on life.  Anne was a Puritan, through and through, and she was a beautiful woman in whose footsteps the women of today would do well to follow.  She knew her place, and delighted in her role as a woman.  She lived with passion, and the book describes those things, people, and ideas about which she was passionate.  I look to Anne as an ideal of a Godly woman, a woman whose many virtues I would like to mirror.  

Wilson makes the point that Anne was a typical Puritan in her beliefs and views.  She does not conform to the Puritan stereotype, which is not Puritan at all, but more like a grim Victorian outlook.  The Puritans were sober but not grim.  They valued their women, and their education.  They were passionate about life.  

I recommend the book to those who want a better understanding of Anne's character, and that of her times, and those who want to see the life of an exemplary Christian woman.
