This is an exciting adventure story that keeps the reader's interest while modeling values without being preachy.  My eight-year-old just finished this as part of our Viking studies.  He enjoyed it greatly and would read us his favorite passages.  I found the historical elements complemented what we had already learned from non-fiction.  While this type book is generally what would be considered a &quot;boys' books&quot;, the presence of a strong major female character might make this book more appealing to some of the girls than other stories of this genre.  Ness is in the midst of the action, and exhibits courage, intelligence, and compassion.  These and other virtues are shown in the characters as traits worthy to develop.  Specifically, Beorn learns the dangers of pride and how a Viking chief can be both gentle and strong.  A great book - I highly recommend
