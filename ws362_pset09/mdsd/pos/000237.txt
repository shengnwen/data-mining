I was curious to know why Texans are obsessive about Texas and  chose this book for its broad overview in the hope of finding an answer. The scope is ambitious enough to be informative without being mired in detail, and is amply illustrated. I especially like the sections at the back of the book: Chronology of Major Events, a calendar of special events, Texas in film, contact information, and more. The only thing lacking -and I really missed it! - is a good map of Texas
