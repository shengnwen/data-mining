This is a very compelling story of a tribal african man and his family before the onset of colonialism and then how they deal with the infiltration of europeans.  What is unusual is that this book is actually written by an african.  Most fiction that deals with tribal africa is actually written not by africans but by european or american novelists.  

Achebe trys to show the african charecters in a realistic light.  Very flawed but heroic in thier own way.  He does not reduce his africans into victimized but nobel cartoon charecters who embody some mysterious but profound primitive enlightenment that eludes us dense and insensitive westerners.  Instead of showing the christians as some racist and overbearing outsiders he also shows them as flawed but dedicated.  

To be frank I find it a refreshing alternative to all the self-loathing white literature written about Africa.
