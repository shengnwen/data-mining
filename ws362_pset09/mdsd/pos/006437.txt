Organized in a simple and direct manner, this book has proved to be an invaluble reference. I am in the process of writing a procedure manual for the AP department of a large public school district and this book gives me  exactly what I need to impart an accounting vocabulary to my readers. I  recommend this book to anyone who works among, or has frequent contact,  with financial professionals.  Once you know what the word means, the rest  falls into place
