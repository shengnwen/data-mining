This book is a fantastic reference book pertaining to the appearance, mating behaviors, habitat and range, nesting patterns, and favorite foods of North American Owls.  The color pictures are so much better than any  black and white drawing could hope to achieve. The individual discriptions  are well organized under sub-topics for quick reference
