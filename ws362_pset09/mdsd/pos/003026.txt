The History of Hell by Alice K. Turner is an exquisite book detailing the numerous accounts of the &quot;evil side&quot; of the afterlife from the ancient Sumatrans belief in the underworld to the freudian account of hell is in man's mind. If for nothing else, the pictures and exquisite illustrations that accompany the pages of this book more then make up for its price. I felt as if I were looking back in time, and the comprehensive yet concise accounts of aferworldly visions and their evolutions through time was wonderful. A must read for any budding anthropologist, sociologist, or psychologist - especially for its evolutionary overview of the pain and punishment aspects of the human mind
