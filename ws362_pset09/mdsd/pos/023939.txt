This book was suggested to me by a friend who read it years ago and employs one of the steps in the book.  His business is highly successful and he doesn't spend a fortune in marketing.  I read this book recently and have started to use the suggestions by author Marcia Yudkin.  The book is an easy read and full of examples.  The steps are not difficult to perform and, in some cases, don't cost a thing.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to increase visibility of their product, services, or themselves
