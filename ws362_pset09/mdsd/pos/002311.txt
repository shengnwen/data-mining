Like great golf stories?  About ball that goes where hitter wants?  A club used by a champion that swings that way with whoever swings it? What Sherlock Holmes would do with a golf club in his hand?

This is but few of the absolutely wonderful short stories to do with golf, selected over years by authors from differing eras, but with all same theme: revolvement around getting the white pill in the hole.

Tough to select any favorites out of this excellent selection of 24, but "Golf is a Nice Friendly Game" is my selection.  How can you miss with a tale wound around giving away one's whole wartime allocation of rubber for golf ball business based on wager of two old CEO duffers with their sponsored pros playing?

Must have for the avid golf reader!  Pure enjoyment
