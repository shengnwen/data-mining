Herman provides an excellent introduction to the philosophy of history. The writing is exceptionally lucid for a topic so demanding. &quot;Serious scholars&quot; might not appreciate summary discussions of Spengler, Hegel,  Toynbee, Chamberlain, Dubois, Garvey, Aquinas, and others, but the form of  Herman's presentation suits his ultimate goal just fine. Furthermore, the  willing reader will learn a great deal about classic works in the field AND  be entertained. &quot;The Idea of Decline&quot; constantly challenges one  to consider the value of clearly stated world views and, if readers share  my experience, they will be encouraged to pursue further reading in the  philosophy of history with vigor. In sum : A great, thought-provoking read
