     Uncommon Traveler is a glimpse into the life of Mary Kingsley.  The book takes us from her lonely childhood to her adventurous travels in Africa.  The author, Don Brown, paints a vivid portrait of what it is like to follow your dreams.
     Don Brown is a professional illustrator.  His first book, Ruth Law Thrills A Nation, was a Reading Rainbow feature selection.  In Uncommon Traveler, he accomplishes the goal of explaining that it is possible to achieve your dreams, no matter what obstacles you might face.  He does this in a very imaginative, but effective way.
     Mary Kingsley is a character that gives us all hope.  She has a difficult childhood, but she is complacent with her life.  She says: "I had a great, amusing world of my own: the books in Father's library".  This sets the tone for the book and her life.
     Don Brown is considered to be a pacesetter in writing storyographies.  Uncommon Traveler is an uncommon children's book.  I think he hits the mark with this one.
