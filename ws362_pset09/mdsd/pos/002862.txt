This is very much a work of history. It basically is the story of Israeli from about 1990 to 2000 (after the author's update). This turbulent decade almost brought about the collapse of the government, and Hamas, along with Yahya Ayyash--"The Engineer," were a major reason as to why. The Engineer is described here to the best of the author's ability, but, due to the terrorist's secrecy and a need to live in the shadows, a complete understanding of his character is simply not possible. This book imparts a wide variety of knowledge as the reader will walk away with a ton of information about Israeli government and culture. Before reading it, I really didn't understand what Shin Bet was, but now I am well-versed in their functioning. This book is the perfect complement to anything concerning the Mossad. 

As far as its narration goes, and I know this probably is a cliché, I honestly couldn't put the pages down. If I didn't have a job I probably would have finished it in a day. Katz is a fine writer and aptly outlines both emotion and the logical flow of ideas in his chapters. His text manages to be informative and riveting at the same time. The only problem I had with him was towards the end where he really seems to buy into the notion of a "cycle of violence" is to blame. He honestly believes that only a peace process will solve Israel's problems, but no armistices are possible with the likes of Hizbollah and Hamas. They will only be satisfied with Israel's complete extinction. Anything signed with civilian entities, that have no authority over the extremists, will be worthless. It is unfortunate that the author, given his intelligence and extensive education, has remained an idealist to this day
