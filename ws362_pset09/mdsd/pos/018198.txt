I found this book very entertaining. For those that listen to Mr. Cramer on the radio, the book reads exactly as he sounds on his radio show 'Real Money'.
The book takes you by the hand and introduces you to the general ideas of trading and investing. However, Mr. Cramer's target audience is not the seasoned investor but rather beginners and the mainstream retail trader/investor. This doesn't mean that a seasoned investor can not read the book. I actually find that the book is funny and, if you happen to enjoy Jim's way of expressing himself, you'll find the book interesting.
In my opinion, Mr. Cramer accomplishes 3 objectives on this book: 
* it opens the appetite for those who are new to the game
* stablishes rules for those who are new, starting or casual investors
* lays down a foundation about investing

Mr. Cramer does not deliver on this book secrets about the stock market nor techniques for trading/investing.

The book is intended to be an "starter"
