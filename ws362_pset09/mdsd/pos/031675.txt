A great story, and a great read but please Jack, start checking your details and facts.  A submarine weighs exactly the same every time it submerges (archimedes law), having fewer passengers won't make it lighter or faster.  I found some of the technical mistakes enormously distracting from a great story, and easily written around.  Otherwise, better than Clive Cussler and with some practice may be the next Tom Clancy.  Well worth the reading
