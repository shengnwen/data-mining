If you think yourself as a serious beginner and wanna teach yourself photography, get this book.
I borrowed this book from local public library, and I love it instantly. 

First, this book covers a lot of topics, which make me feel it's universal ^_^ form "One-use camera" to "Digital toning", all of them were well organized into 2pages and fit under 4 categories: Basic techniques, Photographing People, Travel Photography, Advanced Techniques.

Second, In every topic, the author give you detailed technics to shoot right, plus the wrong/right picture samples, it's very easy to read and follow.

To me, this book can be used as an Text book for Practicing Photography 101, - what you need to add are some quizes and home work after every chapter.

How to use this book? Read this book, grab a camera and shoot!
After practicing the technics or tricks the book covered, I'm sure you will shoot much better the most of other people
