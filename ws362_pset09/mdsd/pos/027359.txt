Since I am not a huge fan of Highsmith's mystery novels, enjoying this superb collection was an unexpected surprise (after being recommended to me by a friend). There are five collections of Highsmith's short fiction included in this book and there are a few undeniable masterpieces in each one of them. First up is &quot;The Animal Lover's Book of Beastly Murder,&quot; which includes stories where the protagonists are animals trying to survive in the human world. My favorite is &quot;The Bravest Rat in Venice,&quot; about a rat exacting a horrible revenge on the family who maimed him. Also enjoyable was &quot;Notes from a Respectable Cockroach.&quot; &quot;The Little Tales of Misogyny&quot; was my least favorite group of stories, though &quot;The Victim&quot; is very well done. For me, the truly great stories of this anthology begin with the &quot;Slowly, Slowly in the Wind&quot; section (and where Highsmith begins to show her amazing versatility as a writer). &quot;The Pond,&quot; is a terrific tale of horror and bereavement. &quot;One for the Islands&quot; is a creepy sci-fi cruise. &quot;Please Don't Shoot the Trees&quot; is a superb futuristic tale. And &quot;Slowly, Slowly in the Wind&quot; is a masterpiece of horror and murder. From the collection of &quot;The Black House&quot; are even more terrific stories. &quot;Not One of Us&quot; is a wicked, gossipy tale of friends and outsiders. &quot;The Terrors of Basket-Weaving&quot; exhibits &quot;possession&quot; at its most haunting. &quot;Blow It&quot; is a great comedy of manners of a man trying to choose between two girlfriends. And &quot;The Black House&quot; is a haunted house story gone wrong, where it is not the house that is as haunted as the men who keep the story of it alive. Highsmith exhibits a more domestic, suburban style with the stories in &quot;Mermaids on the Golf Course.&quot; &quot;Chris's Last Party&quot; is about an actor's fear when his mentor becomes ill. &quot;The Cruelest Month&quot; is indeed cruel. And the finest story of the collection (and my favorite) is &quot;The Romantic,&quot; which chronicles a young woman's &quot;fantasy dates.&quot; Highsmith is a good, succinct writer who doesn't waste time embellishing or exaggerating her prose, instead letting the plot lead her characters toward their conclusions. I also highly recommend &quot;Nothing That Meets the Eye: The Uncollected Stories of Patricia Highsmith,&quot; another compilation of Highsmith's short stories. While not as terrific as &quot;Selected Stories,&quot; it does include a few favorites and masterpieces, among them &quot;The Second Cigarette,&quot; &quot;A Bird in Hand,&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Mrs. Blynn, the Trouble with the World.&quot
