Bernstein's premise is that economic growth stems from propserity, which comes from private property rights, scientific rationalism, capital access and lastly good transportation and communication. Prosperity precedes democracy not the reverse (which could be a veiled criticism of our Iraq venture).  The first two thirds of ther books applies this premise backwards to the development of modern economies. Where these 4 factors were apparent (Britain and Holland) growth came. Where they were wanting (Spain and Japan) growth did not.

The last third applied the model to modern economics and of course the stellar progress of the United States. Liberal democracies tend to retstrain military adventurism which can be the road to ruin for totalitarian regimes without the essential fours factors (Russia).

Such a model in spite of its imperfections is a good tool for amateur historians and economists to bring together economic history in a clear and usable form, helping to understand how we fit in a complicated global economy.  

It is only one model and other models could reach a different conclusion. Though some of the early examples could have been condensed, the books provides a view that would enhance a reader's understanding without overbearing academics. Very readable, graphs were clear and relevant.
