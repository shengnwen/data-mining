With Robert Munsch as a storyteller and Michael Martchenko as an illustrator you are guaranteed a delightful read with lively pictures to entertain the kids. My kids (5&2) love this book as they live with giants too, ever seen your kid in your tshirt and shoes? It was good to see the simple way of showing that differences are just something that makes us interesting, not someone to fear. 
As an adoptive parent, it's nice to see that theme in a book that doesn't preach adoption, it's just part of the story as are the multi-ethnic illustrations.
For all kids, a fun book, for adults, a fun book, can't top that
