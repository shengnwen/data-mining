I have to chuckle when I read reviews that say this is all common sense. I do agree that it is not all new. And I do agree that it is a lot of common sense, but not necessarily common knowledge.

I also  have to wonder if the reviewer who claims this is all basic really understands all of the principles and techniques that Tracy discloses in ths book. Reviewer does not indicate what business success he has if any.

Granted, this information may seem to be odd for someone who has read those big thick college textbooks and sat in classes listening to college profs teaching business management classes who have never been in business. For me, I'd rather learn from someone who has done it...as Brian Tracy has..

If you are in business or want to be, this book is must reading
