I liked this book.  I wouldn't call it a ROMANCE novel - it was NOT, but it was sort of that style... except the writing was good.  Definitely, it was a book for women, being about four women who had gone to college together some 30 odd years earlier and who had taken a raft trip down the Mississippi River with a large group of girls they went to college with.  They got together for a Riverboat Cruise to have a memorial for the fifth friend, Baby, who had recently died.  

The story went back and forth between the stories of the women on the trip, Baby, and a few other characters.  I don't usually like all of that back and forth stuff, but it was well done and the stories of the women were interesting.  One thing always pops into my mind, though, and that is why does every single person in every single story have to have some problem or secret or woe or whatever lying in the background of their psyche?  I just DO NOT get this.  Can't ANYONE ever be happy in their marriage, not have a deadly disease, be able to love, be loved, whatever?  Is no one really happy?  I understand that just reading about someone being happy might not be such a great story, but when your story is about so many people, couldn't one of them just be "normal" and "happy"?  Just something I think about.  Anyway, the story included a lot of history about the Mississippi and surrounding areas, which I enjoyed, but it was truly a story of women and of friendships and of how people change and how they stay the same.  I was disappointed not to see more of a connection between the women who, as "girls" had been so close, but it was a nice story and I enjoyed it.  

I listened to the audio version of the book and it was narrated by the author.  I think you get a truer narration when the author does it because they know just the way they want you to hear it.  I recommend the story to those who enjoy this type of female literature
