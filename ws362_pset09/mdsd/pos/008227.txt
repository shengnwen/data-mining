I just wanted you to know that I really enjoyed this book.  This book gave me a run down of my personality and told me that I should be exactly what everyone kept telling me I should be.  I should work for myself or be in an entertainment field like acting.  I think that both of these ideas sound great and hopefully one day I will do just that.  Thanks again for this book I have had many people borrow it, but thankfully it came back home.
