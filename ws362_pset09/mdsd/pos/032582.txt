I read this in the libary for curiousity after seeing the TV mini-series and 2003 re-make.  While written in the 1980s, this book's concept could still rival other works written today.  

If any of you have seen the movie or TV mini-series, you know the premise.  A spy is shot in the back, revived by a doctor, and struggles to regain not only his identity, but his mission.  He learns his name is Jason Bourne, but is he really a reputable cold-blooded killer like others say he is?  While some spy novels only contain biff-bam action, this story contains enough suspense and plot twists to keep the reader glued.

The only things not making this book a 5 star are the old style cover and the COMPLEX back-story of Bourne's origin.  Other than that, you have an excellent example of spy fiction at its heyday
