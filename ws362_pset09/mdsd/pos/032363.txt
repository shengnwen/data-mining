I happened upon this book by 'chance' (in other words, the hand of God, in my opinion) and when I read the back, a tear trickled down my face.

Having been overweight much of my life and now being a chronic dieter, I could resonate with Constance's words - I think those thoughts she expressed.  I don't fit the DSM-IV diagnoses for bulimia or anorexia.  I'm 'different'.  She is so right - there is a constant battle going on in my mind regarding weight, eating, and exercising.  I am addicted to food AND exercising.  It governs my every waking thought and even governs my day and how I  spend my time.  It's insane, I know.  Finding balance is something I am working on.  The sad thing? Losing weight DEFINITELY changed my life (I lost 70 lbs) and people DO treat you differently (I've never been treated better than I have in the the years since I lost weight).  So, it's hard not to be addicted to dieting when the results are so positive. But are they healthy? That is something I am working out.  Thank you, Constance, for speaking what I feel!!!
