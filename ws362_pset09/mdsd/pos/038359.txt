A wonderful translation (with great notes), of an incredible text. Lacan is a very "dense" writer - in the sense both of difficult and rich. I am not even going to try to sum up all of the ideas and insights that this book will force YOU to produce. (For a useful introduction to Lacan see the books written by Bruce Fink - the translator)
