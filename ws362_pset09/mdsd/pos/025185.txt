The book could have been formatted a bit better for easier use and reference, but it certainly contains a lot of useful information.  In restoring my '67 912 it has been valuable in such areas a interior appointments, body details, and manufacturing dates.  In an update edition paint chips and more year-by-year photos would be of help.  Anyone bringing one of these beauties &quot;back from the dead&quot; should have this book and just plain Porsche fans will find it interesting
