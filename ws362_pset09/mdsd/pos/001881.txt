It took awhile to get into this book, I'd say in the 50 page range, but then it took off for me and it was great. I ordered the sequel as soon as I finished the book. The characters were exciting, the period facinating, enough sex to keep it interesting, and I had withdrawal as soon as I closed the book for the last time
