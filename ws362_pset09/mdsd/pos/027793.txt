I am in a situation similar to the character in the book to a lesser degree. So it was with great interest that I dove into this book. I was curious to read about Don Snyder's feelings and actions while he was unemployed. Probably many of us share his overconfidence about the ease of finding another job. And many of us subconsciously or not, look down upon those who have to earn their living in lower level jobs. Some of his thoughts and actions I could understand, some I could not. For example, why wouldn't he let his wife find a job and he stay home and watch the kids?(which would much harder than working, let me tell you!) And why didn't he take a job while waiting for responses from the colleges he applied to, since his wife wasn't working? And he stands by and watches his savings go lower and lower. Some of these actions caused me to lose sympathy for him while reading a good portion of the book. One could say he was arrogant and a snob. But by the end he learns valuable lessons about family, work, life, and himself. It does read like a story rather than a clinical assessment. A worthwhile read
