The Covenant is perhaps one of my favorite books written by Michener.  Having lived in South Africa myself, I can attest that the historical accuracy of the novel is about as precise as one could hope for in a country where history has been regularly molded to fit the politics of the group in power at the time, white or black.  While the historical accuracy and relevance of events such as the Mfecane & Battle at Blood River have been questioned and downplayed recently by the ANC, the impact of these events (or stories, depending on your interpretation of history) were highly important during the time in which Michener was writing this book (i.e., slightly over a decade before the symbolic end to the National Party's apartheid regime with the release of Nelson Mandela in 1994). 

Michener also does a masterful job of describing the nuances between the various racial and ethnic groups which differ by country of origin, tribe, etc.  Although some reviewers have criticized the lack of breadth in coverage of the various African tribes, he does cover today's two most influential Nguni groups (Zulu & Xhosa), while also touching on the Khoisan (or Khoi Khoi) early on.  This novel also provides a solid understanding of the basis for apartheid (if such a thing can truly be 'understood'), while highlighting how some Boer and many more non-Boer whites despised the system.  All in all, I found this to be both historically accurate (or enlightening, for readers unfamiliar with the history of this region) and a highly entertaining read
