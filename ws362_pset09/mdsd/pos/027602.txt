I was interested in Kissinger after watching Christopher Hitchens inspired documentary on the man.  I thought the documentary may have been a little unfair and harsh, and furthermore Hitchens is an unreliable journalist, just take a look at his dishonest stance on the current war in Iraq.  

There were two themes in Isaacson's book, one that Kissinger was a brilliant man that used realpolitik and détente to navigate through multiple international entanglements during his Nixon years.  And two, that Kissinger much like Nixon was a shallow and insecure man that permitted secrecy to trump good diplomacy.  There was no doubt that Kissinger was realistic in his political agenda and ignored ethical dilemmas that would have made other administrations pause.  

Compared to this administrations mendacious and exceedingly unrealistic Wilsonian goal of democratizing the Mideast, I thought a Kissinger styled biography would be an interesting counterbalance. 

Isaacson's book is quite long, but very readable starting with Kissinger growing up in Nazi Germany and fleeing to the United States as a teenager.  It ends with Nixon's resignation and Kissinger's private consulting work with none other than J. Paul Bremer who screwed up the Iraqi occupation.  

The United States foreign policy establisment could probably learn a thing or two between Nixon and Kissinger's realpolitik and the false ideology and radicalism of Bush 43.  Shouldn't our foreign policy embrace ethics in diplomacy in a realistic way?
