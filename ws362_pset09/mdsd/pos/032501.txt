A great little book that is a sort of &quot;pick me up.&quot;  I borrowed the book from the library on audio CD. It is a short little book, so even an unabridged audio was not very long.  The Go Getter is a fanciful parable about the payoff of being a hard worker and being determined to get things done. The story is simple, direct, and motivational. It raises the listener's spirits without preaching. It was great fun and appropriate for any audience. The reader spoke clearly and with a feeling appropriate to the material. It was very comfortable listening
