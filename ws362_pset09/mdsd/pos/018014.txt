This book answered many  questions from previous books such as Sethos's idenity and how long will it take for Nefret and Ramses to get together. It was such a relief after the heartwrenching events of The falcon at the Portal. Amelia is as fascinating and hilarious as ever. I am glad that I startes at the begininning of the series because it is wonderful to see all the characters grow. My only worry is that Amelia and Emerson are getting old!
