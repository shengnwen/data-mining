Bertie Wooster, a well-heeled but "mentally negligible" London bachelor,  is the enjoyable narrator of this comic novel from Edwardian era England.  The book is really more of a collection of stories, pulled loosely together by the impulsive romances of Bingo Little, Bertie's old school chum and "friend for more than 15 years," who mooches meals and cigarettes and falls in and out of love with the most inappropriate people.  Lack of intelligence is no affront to Bertie's self respect, since -- as a member of the "upper classes"  -- he is "so sunk in callous self-indulgence" that he restricts his life primarily to drinking, eating, gambling and occasionally being terrorized by his aunts.  However, when Bertie faces imminent matrimony with Honoraria Glossip, the amazonian daughter of the "eminent loony-doctor" -- when Bertie is swindled into putting a deposit on stolen pearls --  when Bertie's life is disrupted by his two "excreascenceses, " nephews Claude and Eustace, who suffer from an excess of the "sporting spirit" -- when Bingo becomes a street-preaching socialist in order to win the woman of his heart -- -- when Bertie is persuaded to pose as the romance writer Rosie M Banks, in order to appeal to Bingo's father on his behalf  . . . when Bertie, as he so frequently does, lands in the soup -- he always turns to literature's most famous valet, his perfect manservant Jeeves.  With cool and intellectual precision, Jeeves invariably solves the problem with a few deft strokes, and sometimes a little Shakespeare thrown in.  Although Bertie almost always ends up a the butt of the joke, his good humor and benign temperament ensure a happy ending with no hard feelings.  Jeeves and Bertie are one of Wodehouse's most successful creations, and following them through their adventures is a pleasure that no reader should miss.
