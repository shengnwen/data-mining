This book arrived just in time for Valentine's day for my son! Of all the books that he has at his disposal, he consistently reaches for this one! Maybe it is the bright red color or his beloved Elmo on the cover. Whatever it is, it has gotten a hold on him. I read it to him (he is 15 months old) every day and get a huge smile and hand-clapping when I am finished. We love you too Elmo
