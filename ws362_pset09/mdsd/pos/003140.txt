It is amazing how much can change in a decade. By 1992, communism had fizzled; an obscure Democrat named Bill Clinton was President. And Michael Crichton was writing a novel about the threat posed by the Japanese.
In the Rising Sun, John Connor and Lt. Peter Smith are called to assist in a homicide at Nakamato Towers, a sprawling conglomerate. What starts out as a trivial murder, soon explodes and becomes a tale of Japanese industrial subterfuge reaching the corridors of power.
Crichton does an admirable effort of explaining the cultural differences between the West and East. In the 80's Lee Iacocca, former CEO of Chrysler and Ford, in his autobiography, had warned of the insidious business practices of the Japanese, but it took the talent of Crichton to bring it to a mass audience. The plot is decent, with Connor in the perfect role as teacher.
However when one reads the Rising Sun in the present, one is struck with the realization that though the charges remain, the bugbear has changed. It is no longer Japan; it is now China. (Especially after Lenovo bought the PC division of IBM.)

Going beyond the tense murder investigation, the duplicity of foreign corporations, and the hypocrisy of our elected officials, this novel might just teach us that the American economy is more resilient than we think
