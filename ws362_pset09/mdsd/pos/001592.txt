Like his prior book "Growing The Distance", Jim Clemmer's "Leader's Digest" is a sampler of high impact ideas. Each chapter (or article) is attractively packaged as a brief essay within apt anecdotes and quotations.

In marketing there is a saying that you sell the sizzle, not the steak. Jim Clemmer sells the rich, savory steak surrounded by the sizzle.

Some of Clemmer's ideas are classic Business School. Some are recognizable from the pop-psych realm. All are uniquely restated in forms that make them quickly and easily accessible to even the beginning leader. And motivationally rejuvenating to the old pros.
