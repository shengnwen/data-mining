Hillerman really knows how to spin a good tale and tie together all sorts of different subplots together into one knot as they all interrelate.  Joe Leaphorn doesn't believe in coincidences, and neither does the author.  And nothing simply coincides in his books, all the subplots come together neatly.

An anthropologist disappears, two men are found murdered, a backhoe is missing and Joe Leaphorn, who's wife has recently died and is retiring from the force, wants one last big case before he quits.  He cooperates with junior officer Jim Chee who just wants to find out who stole that damned backhoe and murdered those two men in the truck.

The book is really full of surprises and has a totally surprise ending.  Not the one that I was really hoping for or betting on, but it was a shocker.  A little hard to follow all the plots coming together however, which was why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5.
