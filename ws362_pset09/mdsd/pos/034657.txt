 
I am an eager, though unofficial, student of professor Elaine Pagels. Through her writings she has guided me to a greater understanding of and appreciation for my Judeo-Christian heritage, as well as into a deeper grasp of the timeless truths of Gnosis. I owe a great debt to her for her marvelous instruction. So, I regret to have to give The Origin of Satan less than five stars. 

When I purchased this book I simply assumed the title was accurate and I would be treated to an historical study of the germination, growth, and evolution of the figure of Satan in world religions. Instead, the book is limited to a study of Satan as a literary and political device in the Gospels and in Christian church history, a much more limited study than the title implies. 

Unlike such marvelous books as The Gnostic Gospels and Beyond Belief, The Origin of Satan is a difficult read. Though I would not categorize it as overly difficult, it is nonetheless a more difficult study than many of Pagels fans might expect. Especially since the author has such an evident gift for making obtuse subject matter both understandable and thoroughly enjoyable. 

This book is a worthwhile read and a valuable addition to ones personal library. It is, however, mistitled and more work than you might expect. A five-star companion volume is JEHOVAH UNMASKED which is a fascinating Gnostic look at the real identity of the god Jehovah. Is Jehovah the real Almighty God or just a pretender? Is God an insane murdering lunatic as the Old Testament says, or is that just a pretender god? Did the first Christians believe in God the Mother? What and where is the Kingdom of God? Who told the First Lie in the Garden of Eden, Jehovah or the Serpent? Are you SURE? Who or what was it that gave us the list of New Testament books as we have them now? The answers to these questions will shock you.
