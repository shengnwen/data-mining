This book is fabulous.  More so than Under the Tuscan Sun, and both are better than the movie.  Mayes has such a lightness to her writing, yet her words leave you filled.  She writes of the travels her husband and she make to various regions of Italy, describing the local foods, customs, and topography.  She includes wonderful recipes and paints life in Tuscany as a beautiful thing.  Read on an empty stomach and a full wallet (so you can hop on the next plane to Italy).  I read this before and after a month long trip to Italy and both times Bella Tuscany proved a great way to whet my appetite for the trip, and a nice way to reminisce afterwards
