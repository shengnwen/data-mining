In this post world war three novel, the class system has been re-enacted on earth and God has taken a new role over the poor public.  The book brings together the uninformed technological public with the advanced brotherhood of God.  But one brother has a different take on things and deffects from the order to join the witches of the dark underground.  IN the end, the oppresive brotherhood is overrun by the witches in a spectacular show of technology power.   	The book took a new approach to the sometimes dull sci-fi books.  The dark world was unlike any other and many times the reader felt like the book didn't have any point.  But in any case it made you think about the setting and a new world of the mind.  A good read for the sci-fi fan who wants something a bit different
