The paradox that is Marlon Brando has always been the allure for me, besides the obvious brillance as an actor. I'm far from alone in my opinion. I think it was appropriate that he didn't write about his marriages and children. Such things, as we know, are private matters too painful and complex. Confessionals and tell-all autobiographies are not interesting anyway, and rarely do they reveal the true character of their subjects. I learned a lot about who Brando was just by reading his description of autumn leaves in Libertyville and the night sky over Tetiaroa.

Brando was a human being with passions, demons, and needs just like the rest of us. He loved Chimps, traveling, Afro-Cuban music, fart jokes, and good books. He was more instinctual than analytical. This is evident by the terse analysis he gives of his film characters. Brando did not "piss away his talent" as Dick Cavett had said on an NPR phone interview last year. As this book reveals, Brando never had the acting bug. That's why he only worked when he wanted or needed to work. And that's why he didn't have the work ethics or ambition that our culture expects from a talented film star. If Brando had contempt it was for Hollywood and it's pretentions, not for his craft. In the book, you'll find admiring and humble tributes to his mentors and fellow actors, including Stella Adler, Elia Kazan, Karl Malden, James Dean, Robert Duvall, and Kenneth Branagh.

I'm glad Brando lived long enough to get old and fat, and that he didn't die tragically young like Marilyn, JFK, or Jimi Hendrix. I'm thankful for the films and words he did leave behind. This book reveals what a natural born trickster he was, his generous and tempestuous nature, how he was seeker of truth and a voluptuary. Brando was all this and more. I truely miss him.
