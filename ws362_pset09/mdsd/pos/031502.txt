I bought this book after watching a Seminar where the book was repeatedly referenced. Glad I got it, lots of details that weren't covered in the Seminar and I probably would have tried some of the things on my own and have failed. The book stepped me through the migration process to a point where I understand what is going on. This is a GREAT book, I highly recommend it for any company migrating to Exchange 2007
