The photos that pack this great book are amazing! If you are even considering getting into macro photography you should own this book. I found myself up late into the night unable to put it down. Afterward I was so eager to get out and explore this new world that I had never put much thought to. Who would have thought tiny bug and other &quot;creepy crawlies&quot; would be so colorful and fascinating
