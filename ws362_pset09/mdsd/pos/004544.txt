This is a very nice publication to have on your shelf.  Van Gogh is an icon of Western culture and it is almost certain that you can call more than a few of his images to mind quite easily.  What this provides is a greater context for those several images by providing what it calls "the complete paintings".  I have no ability to say whether it is complete or not, but I can say that the vast number of paintings reproduced here provide a wonderful context and the images become more connected and make quite a bit more sense than they do in isolation.

Are the color reproductions perfect?  Of course not!  Mechanical coloring cannot approach the vivid colors these paintings have in real life.  I am always pleasantly surprised when I get to an art museum and see real colors up close and personal.  Things are so wonderfully vivid!  The texture of the surfaces is also fabulous to see in person.

But a book can never be as brilliant as seeing the painting in person.  However, for a few dollars you can survey a body of work you will never be able to see in a lifetime.  So, it is a fair trade off.  Just make sure you get to a good museum as frequently as you can to enrich you senses and your soul.

The text accompanying the paintings is really very good.  The problem is that is provided next to a painting by Van Gogh and one's eyes can barely stay on the text.  I find myself drifting to every nearby painting and focusing on that more than what the editors are telling me about Van Gogh's life and work.  

Very much recommended. The binding, Paper or Hardcover is irrelevant for home use.  Pick whichever you prefer and can afford.  For heavy use, obviously the hardcover is the better choice
