I bought this book for my sister's baby shower.  I am a book nut, and I wanted to get her a helpful book that would have good tips for new parents.  I don't have children, so I had no idea what book to get.  I spent over an hour in Borders reading various baby books, until I finally decided on this one.  I practly read the first chapter right there in the store and was so impressed by how simple and logical the author made everything sound, that I was sold.  I also really liked that the book was written more like a reference guide.  You don't necessarily start on page one and read continusly to the last page.  It's broken up into lists, and there are little tip boxes in the margins.  The author gives lots of different senieros (like your baby won't sleep in his crib), and she not only explains how to handle the situation, but why it's happening and how to prevent it from occuring again. She teaches you how to know exactly what your baby wants, so it takes the frustration out of gussing why your baby's crying and won't stop. When my sister read the book, and applied the methods and tips to her baby, she was amazed how well it worked.  She now calls the book "heaven sent" and buys one for every new mother she knows.  She has thanked me numerous times because that book made those first few months caring for a newborn so much easier and more enjoyable for her and her husband.  Since she now recommends the book so highly, I ended up ordering 2 more books for my cousin and best friend.  They also raved about how amazing the book was, and how much it helped them.  I'm really glad I found this book.  This author definately knows her stuff!!
