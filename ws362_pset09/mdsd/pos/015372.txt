Once again Lee Server has proven himself to be The premiere biographer of his time.  Not just of the celebrity type, but of any kind.  His previous definitive biography of Robert Mitchum, "Baby I Don't Care", re-defined the art of this genre in a way that has just not been done before.

This artful story of the most beautiful woman ever to cross the Hollywood hills reads like a novel, but is meticulously researched and written in a way that makes the read not only pleasurable, but a real joy as well.  It is a story of one of show busineses true enigmas, and Mr. Server's treatment of her life gives us the whole story.  Rags to riches.  A poor self image.  And a woman who took no quarter and gave none as well.

If you only buy one book this year, this will not disappoint you by a long shot.  It is pure entertainment in its very truest sense.  Don't wait until it comes to your local bookstore because there is a good chance that it will be sold out before you get there.  Order it here to be sure you get a copy of your own.  And, don't loan it.  You won't get it back.  It is quite simply that good.  Server has hit another one out of the park, and already I can't wait to see what his next subject is going to be.  A superb writer doing a marvelous subject her just do.

An unadulterated true classic in the making.  Do yourself a favor, buy two, and give one as a gift that will be appreciated to no end.  Thank you.
