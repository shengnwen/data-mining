I have read a lot of star biographies, some are affecting, some are guarded and some are tell it like it was. 
I loved this one. 

Although she had a co-author, Phyllis' strong personality came through.  I love the woman and the comedian, so perhaps my review is a little biased--but I did read this book in one day because I couldn't wait to get back to it.  It zings by like her personality--fast.

There were some surprises in this book--but the biggest for me was her discovery of the book The Magic of Believing by Claude Bristol and what a strong effect it had on her.  It truly changed her life.  In addition, I was fascinated to read of how she would take a notebook a draw/write visual affirmations such as: Beverly Hills, office buildings, oil wells, ect. before she hit her big success.

She truly deserves her pioneering success especially after her struggles to get there.   Also interesting is her friendship with Bob Hope, her musical background and her plastic surgeries.

A lot of bang for the book Buck!!!

Thank you Phyllis!!
