Nightmares. Flies. Rotten egg smell. Suicide. Spiritual warfare. Whoa. And that's just the beginning.

It is summer in Dallas and Dylan Foster, a university psychologist, likes her life. Until she meets a strange man at a faculty picnic. Who is he and what does he want?

Matters worsen when she and all her coworkers receive anonymous gifts, a former student says she harassed him, and the engagement ring that should be on her dead mother's finger shows up once again. A friend of hers insists she has called and asked him out. What in Texas is going on?

Dylan's life is spinning out of control, but what can she do to stop it? The forces at work prove powerful and mysterious as she searches for clues to the mysteries surrounding her. Thankfully, she is told to pray and to put on her armor. Sage advice. As one of her friends says: "The good news is that as a child of the King, you're entitled to protection."

Will she find the inner strength to fight the spiritual battle she now admits she's involved in? Can she use her newfound knowledge to keep others from danger?

I can't say enough glowing comments about this novel. It proved suspenseful, exciting, funny and a little creepy, which gives it high marks in my mind. Wells handles this weighty subject matter perfectly, balancing seriousness with levity. I absolutely adored Dylan Foster's character. She catapulted herself into my reality and stayed there.

Bravo. I hope to see many more of Wells' works soon. Check out Book 2 in the Day of Evil Series, Soul Hunter, coming in May
