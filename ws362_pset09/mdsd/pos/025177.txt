Vanish with the Rose is an astounding murder mystery with a twist of paranormal. My sister recommended this book and what a wonderful adventure. The basic story is about a lawyer who pretends to be rose expert to solve a haunting mystery. You have mix of murders, ghosts and amazing friendships.  She finds herself falling love with the old house and developing compassionate friends.  I would recommend this book and I would also suggest The Ice House by Minette Walters
