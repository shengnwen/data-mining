Unlike Stephen King, Richard Laymon knows how to write an ending.  This book is a little slow in the middle, but the beginning is like riding a rocket.  I was reading at lightning speed and had the biggest grin on my face.  Laymon's books are just so much fun!  Extremely gory, sexually graphic, and refreshingly unpredictable, BODY RIDES is among the best of his books (IN THE DARK, ISLAND, NO SANCTUARY are just a few).  If I was ever stranded on an island and allowed to read only one author, Richard Laymon would be the one.
