While some people may argue that this is just a 'vanity' book, the pictures within will convince all that the body is an amazing piece of art.  David Life and Sharon Gannon, owners of the immensely popular Jivamukti Studio (http://www.jivamuktiyoga.com/) in New York, contort their bodies in ways that are truly mind-boggling. The photos are shot in black and white - alternating between playful and intense moods.  If you are a fan of Life or Gannon, this book is a tribute to their mastery of yoga.

For those of us who just enjoy yoga, this is art - pure and simple.  For those who are not familiar, the pictures may be intimdidating or a curiosity.
