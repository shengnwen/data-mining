My own experiences concur with this book as I have traveled down many spiritual paths, each one a very different experience. William James gives a satisfying intellectual framework within which to understand differing religious experiences. Reading his words is a good corrective to the current PC notion that "there is but one Mountain and many paths to the top." Nonsense. There are as many mountains as there are paths. You will be pleased with the purchase of this book, as it will be one you will have occasion to refer to again and again.

Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever!
