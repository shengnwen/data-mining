Not the funniest Wodehouse I have read--but still far better than any other "humourist book" I have attempted to read by more contemporary writers, in recent memory.  Wodehouse was a master craftsman, it is always easy to picture exactly what he is writing, see the expressions on the characters faces as they utter their completely brilliant dialogue.  The back and forth arguements between Aunt Dahlia and Bertie are great.  The high point for me in this book was the scene in the famous Anatole's bedroom.  

I was pretty excited to actually encounter Anatole in this book, I don't remember having actually seen him in action in any of the other Jeeves books i have read to date (always heard of his greatness and genius though).  

The plot for this is much like any of the others for the books in this series.  Some of Bertie's friends have gotten themselves into a huge knot on the romantic front (its true, its remarkably easy to pick up the lilting affectations of Wodehouse dialogue after reading his books)  however--instead of having Jeeves fix it right away, Bertie beleives that Jeeves "has gone soft" and that it us up to Wooster to fix the problems.  While his tactics are actually quite good--he hasn't learned to anticipate the stupidity his friends are capable of when in the midst of such plots.  It isn't until the last few pages that we see Jeeves at the reigns again.  At poor Bertie's expense, as always.

Very enjoyable read
