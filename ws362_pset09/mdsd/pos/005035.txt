This book has completely changed my thinking about pro-life, assisted suicide and euthansia.  The true life stories and factual information allow Ms. Folger to present very persuasive arguments supporting her cause.  I  was appalled at the lies and misinformation that has been publicly held up  as 'fact' and that I was stupid enough to believe it.  Ms. Folger's courage  and faith in the face of adversity can help you believe that with God  nothing is impossible!  If you want the truth about these topics, this book  is a must read
