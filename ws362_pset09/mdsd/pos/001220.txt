This is a plot to flip for (read the book!)!  Who else but the two masters of the dark side could team up to create such an incredibly scary, tearjerking, suspense filled dream of a book but King and Straub!  One of my ALL TIME favorite reads!

This book combines childhood dreams, fantasy, mystery, a smidgen of horror and a lot of magic and suspense.  You won't be able to put it down so don't start till you have plenty of free time to spend with Jack Sawyer and his band of buddies (and foes). 

You'll end the book wanting more, I guarantee it.  Great read, great story, great storytelling.
