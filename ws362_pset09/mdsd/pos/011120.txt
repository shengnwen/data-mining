Dr. Jim Taylor does a fabulous job clarifying a parent's role in his book, "Positive Pushing".  He gives you a framework to guide decisions about children's activities, schedules and responsiblities. I don't feel the panic to join everything or the guilt about not letting them quit piano lessons.  He taught me what is negotiable with my three boys and what isn't.  I am more of an in-charge parent.  We have a new house rule:  "one sport, one music...no more, no less".  It has worked beautifully for 3 years now.  Everyone is trying new things but they are not overwhelmed because they are trying too many new things and they are not bored because they aren't trying anything new.  

Dr. Taylor taught me to own my part of parenting and to let my boys own their part.  They are proud of the "excellence" they achieve by always working as hard as they can.  The word "perfect" has been removed from our vocabulary.  Once you open your eyes to how imperfect everything is...you'll never put that pressure on yourself or children again.  Dr. Taylor brought joy back to my parenting and, I hope, to my children's childhood again.  

Every parent owes it to themselves to read this book!  Thanks Dr. Taylor
