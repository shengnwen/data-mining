Health and dietary experts continue to uncover new health benefits from eating pumpkin, but many find pumpkins difficult to cook with.  Enter DeeDee Stovel's great cookbook to the rescue!  First, many of us have a misconception that a cooking pumpkin is that large carving pumpkin known as a Jack-O-Lantern.  Cooking pumpkins such as "Small Sugar" - the standard pie pumpkin, or "Rouge d'Etampes - the standard soup pumpkin, are considerably smaller than carving pumpkins.  In addition, their eating quality is excellent whereas carving pumpkins have very little flavor or sweetness.  These pumpkins are so delicious, you'll wonder why you've never eaten them before.  And they are packed with nutrients including phytonutrients, which protects your skin from sun cancer. 

In this book, DeeDee Stovel has developed many pumpkin recipes including soups such as Caribbean Black Bean.  She shares how to roast or grill pumpkin, then add it to salads.  Or you can make side dishes by mashing and mixing in herbs and other fruits.  Recipes for pumpkin fruit smoothies and even a pumpkin drink are included.  On the top of my list of her pumpkin dishes to try is Roasted Ginger pumpkin soup.

This cookbook would be such a big help to young mothers who were never taught cookery and only know how to order a pizza.  The recipes are not only simple to follow, suprisingly delicious, and appealing even to young children,  but the dishes will save you loads of money in your monthly food bill while promoting your personal health
