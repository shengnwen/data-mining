I bought this book for our store reference.  My staff became hooked, the information is solid and written in a way that reads like a book built for leisure. One critique;  There could be more pictures in her book, although a cliche - a picture is worth a thousand (descriptive) words.  I will buy more books from Ms Matlins, she has established herself as THE DEFINITIVE WRITER for gems and pearls.  Thanks for the great reading material.  Veronica, Ali'i Jewelry - Hawai
