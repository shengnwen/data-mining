This is an impressive collection of 60+ articles on teaching and learning.  Don't be confused by the title, it isn't just for sociology, it can help all teachers in college or university.  There is also a CD included that has 70+ other articles and resources you can use.  It should help me as I write my own articles but also as I design new courses and revamp old ones.  I'm glad it was recommended to me at the last teaching workshop I attended. A bit pricey but if you take teaching scholarship seriously, it may be well worth the investment
