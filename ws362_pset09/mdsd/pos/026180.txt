Ms. T. breaks it down for the game-challenged ladies and gents in THE PLAYER SLAYER: The Pocket Guide to Jamming the Player's Game. Chock-full of advice on topics such as how to spot a player, how players choose the women they play, what happens throughout the course of "the game," and what happens when a player falls in love, THE PLAYER SLAYER is a tell-it-like-it-is account of why we get played and how to stop it.

Ms. T. kept me flipping the pages with her conversational prose, but I must admit that I was a little skeptical of this book when I began reading it. My first impression was that Ms. T. was saying all men are players and there is no hope for women who haven't yet snagged their "nice guy." I was mistaken. The author points out time and again that not all men (or women) are players and that there are plenty of worthy mates for us to choose from. The key is to recognize game when it's being played and not to get played. I'm an advocate of any book that will open eyes and the lines of communication for women and men to build healthy relationships or will spare someone the heartache of getting played.
