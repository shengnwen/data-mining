I have rated this book four stars, not because I feel that it is well above average but not spectacular, as that would normally indicate, but because I do not feel qualified to rate it and wish to have as little effect on its average rating as possible. I am a reasonably intelligent, reasonably well-educated individual with a good facility for numbers. Still, this book was well over my head. If you're planning a career in Mathematics or Physics, this book is probably necessary to your education, but unless you're truly brilliant, don't be surprised if you need qualified instruction to understand it. But if you're simply an intelligent, curious individual with a desire to comprehend Einstein's theories, don't be surprised if you can't make hash of this book
