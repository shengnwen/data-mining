Amazing book with great descriptions of Johnnys works. Much better than the other books on Depp that seem to just gather stuff already put out in articles and journals/news. Some of the points of views of Johnnys movies are a bit upsetting and on the negative side, but all in all a great book to get to know the wonderful world of Depp.
