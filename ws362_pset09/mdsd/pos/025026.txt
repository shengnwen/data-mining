I found Kirk's work to be an excellant antidote to the Religious Right and Neoconservative nonsense that the media and new intellectuals pass on as "conservatism" today. A good place to take back the Conservative philosophy, a philosophy of tolerance, respect, fairness, and progress, from the extremists bent on Right wing "Christian" tyranny
