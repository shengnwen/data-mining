This book is a well written and fast paced narrative. It brings many social issues into the story, such as teachers effects on their students. It also combines the &quot;hate USA&quot; and Arab terrorism to make for a  great story. This is the first book I have read by the author and I am very  impressed. He is able to combine a few different plots together to create  the whole picture. The characters are described in such great detail, you  will have an excellent mental picture
