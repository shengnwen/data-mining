Three books in one, these are hilarious and often touching stories of the Rabbitte family.  The Committments gives some family background, makes us think about what it takes and means to be a manager, and details the rise and fall of a working-class soul band.  The Snapper gets a lot more serious, and is in turns very sad, infuriating and finally uplifting, with one of the Rabbitte daughters becoming a mother.  The focus of the Van shifts squarely to the dad of the Rabbitte family, who goes into business with a fish and chips van, and while I had low expectations for this one, it turned out to be the funniest of the three in my opinion.  Don't miss out on this collection...for the humor alone (and there is much more to these stories than just that) it is one of my favorite books of all time.  I also recommend checking out the Committments on film.
