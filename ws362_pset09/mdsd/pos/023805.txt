VERY good book, parts of it are a bit dated, not really the language, particularly, but the high school dynamic is a bit different than my was, at least. (cheerleaders, hayrides, etc, don't have the same connotation, if that makes sense).

It remains to this day one of my favorite books about relationships. Marceline is so great. Jason is very clueless at times, especially at how to deal with having a girlfriend, but it's very entertaining to see how he goes about it.

all in all, a good read.
