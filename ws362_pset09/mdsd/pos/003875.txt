being a fashion illustration student I was very apprehensive about purchasing another fashion illustration book written by someone who thinks they know how to teach illustration but instead this book is a real treat!! it couvers not only women and men but children also which is very rare. YOU SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK if you're serious about illustration!!
