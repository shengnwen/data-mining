When every review and expert's comment are accolades, one takes note of this book by Dr. Mimi Guarneri. Her Introduction states: "It is difficult for most of us to imagine the heart, since until recently, it's been impossible to actually see... Each heart has its own biography, language, and method of revealing its truth, (IF) we know how to listen." ...Like one reviewer writes, "Finally... a Doctor who listens."

As I perused "The Unexamined Heart"..."The safe predictability of Bensonhurst was a comfort after my mother's death from a myocardial infarction." (Same as the early death of my Oak Ridge, Tenn. Boyhood Friend in 1975.) 

Her first sentence in "A Heart, a Spleen, a Leaking Valve," speaks, "In my position as a cardiologist, it has taken me a long time to have an open heart." Not many writers begin with such potent, inner-meaningful, intensely accurate sentences! 

I'm totally hooked when I get into her complex, lengthy chapter on the "Fog of Stress!" Then getting into those half-way pages, I see, "Doc," he said in a hoarse voice, "I've been seeing angels all morning. In fact, there's a tall one at the foot of my bed right now." Then an arrival of comments about the worlds of hallucinations...I had targeted her chapters, "Depression and Sacred Revelations," as my landing points for the first day's reading! Arrival and Meditation are my present source of Comfort for today! Retired Chaplain/Rabbi Fred W Hood
