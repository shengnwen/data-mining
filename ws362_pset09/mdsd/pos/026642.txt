This large and attractive book combines the work of oceanographer Robert Ballard, author Rick Archibold, and maritime artist Ken Marshall. The course of the book takes you through the history of the trans-Atlantic cruise liner, from its inception in the early nineteenth century, through to today. Along the way, the authors focus on many key happenings, particularly the sinking of certain ships. As an added bonus, information is presented on the Bismarck and the ships of Iron Bottom Sound, in the Solomon Islands. Along the way, the reader is treated to many wonderful illustrations and colorful pictures.

Overall, I found this to be a fascinating book. I enjoyed the stories of ships I had never heard of, such as the Arctic and Atlantic, and I really loved the many pictures. This is a great book, one that is bound to fascinate anyone interested in ship wrecks. I loved it
