Girl of the Limberlost was on the required reading list in my sophmore year of high school.  It was one of the few books I truly loved as an adolescent. I saw the movie a few years ago done by Wonder Works and hated it though, so if you saw only the movie and was disapointed, please check out the book.
 It is about a girl named Elnora who has to deal with her verbally and emotionally abusive mother and the absence of her father.  She is very poor and is seen as an outcast by her peers.  One of her few friends is the "Bird Woman" a woman who collects moths from the Limberlost.  Elnora becomes a collector too and makes money from it.  She eventually finds happiness and falls in love and even receives an apology from her mean mother.  I reommend this book for anyone, child or adult, over age 12.
