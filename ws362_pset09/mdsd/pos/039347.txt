&quot;Language myths&quot; is a book everyone should be required to read (or at least know the basic arguments of).  The only complaint I have is that it would be nice to see (perhaps in the introduction) some discussion of why people hold onto these myths.  It seems that many do so because it gives them a basis on which to categorize people socially, usually in such a way that they themselves end up at or near the top of their hierarchy.  A more in-depth study of language myths in the USA is Rosina Lippi-Green's excellent book &quot;English with an accent: Language, ideology, and discrimination in the United States&quot;
