Breaking Out is the book I've always wanted to read.
The author suffered from acne several years and therefore she understands better how we feel.
Everything you need to know about acne you'll find in this book.
As a journalist she interviewed the best specialists from coast to coast.
That said she doesn't try to impose, what a doctor would, her own view point towards acne treatment.
This way you feel free to pick whathever treatment works best for you. And believe me, she goes through every single one there is.
Although I have a dermarologist, this book helped me out as far as giving me the tools to better explain my doctor what kind of treatment I wanted. 
Knowledge is power especially when it comes to acne and I am much more confident towards my acne treatment now.
If you suffer from acne, this book is a must read
