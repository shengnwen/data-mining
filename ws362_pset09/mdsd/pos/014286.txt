This book is perfect for any professional portfolio manager, trader, and buy-side research analyst.  It articulates a strategy, and more importantly, a mind set that will improve decision making with added confidence.  Dr. Kiev uses real world case studies of PMs and traders overcoming psychological barriers and successfully implementing his strategies. I highly recommend this book.
