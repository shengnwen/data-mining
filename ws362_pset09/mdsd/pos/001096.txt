Remember studying the formation of the republic, or seeing various quasi-historical documentaries on TV, and how the stories typically focus on all the 'rock star' founding fathers, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, etc?  Well if you look or read closely enough, there is one man who is in the background of every important scene.  One man who presence was just as vital, but just didn't have the 'groupie' factor of the others.  For example, when the history channel did a special on Franklin,  they gave considerable time to his signing of the treaty ending the war with Britain, they showed the actual signature and described how John Adams was also part of the effort, but below the signatures of Adams and Franklin, almost completely out of camera shot, was the name John Jay.

The author does a considerable service here by exploring the history and personality of John Jay. His leadership during the revolution, his negotiations during the continental congress, he various efforts on foreign affairs, and the tremendous respect all the other founders had for him.  The political intrigue which served as the background for both treaties (one ending the war, the other "Jay's treaty") are well explored.  Also being explored are the reasons why Jay never rose to the level of the other founding fathers: his physical shortcomings (he seemed to get sick a lot); his desire to focus on working within his state seemed to be more personally satisfying than working at the federal level.

By filling in the personal and professional details of this almost forgotten founding father, the author allows one to get a better understanding of the all the relationships among the founding fathers, the difficulties they faced, and the precarious nature of their efforts.
