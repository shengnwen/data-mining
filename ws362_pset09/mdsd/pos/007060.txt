I originally picked up this trilogy because it looked interesting and the other reviewers raved about it.  Chapters into the first book, I began to wonder why it was so beloved.  More questions than answers swam across the page, drowning me in confusion and frustration.  I felt thrown into a sea without a life preserver.  The language was too archaic at times, and I constantly felt I was not being given enough information to process the storyline.

I felt like I was plowing through the book with an old, tired horse in a massive field full of rocks while the burning sun beat down from above.  Being a complete-ist, however, I trudged on and picked up book #2.  Halfway through, I pleasantly discovered that my horse was more spry, the rocks had disappeared from the field, and I was wearing a broad-rimmed hat.  I was still plowing, but it wasn't nearly as painful.  By book #3, I had a tractor, cool breeze, and lemonade in my hand.  The work was no longer a chore but a welcome vacation I found thoroughly enjoyable.

I can hardly account for the transition, but it did happen.  I recommend the trilogy to those who are not afraid to persevere in the beginning to achieve a great reward in the end
