This is one brilliant book.  She has taken a subject of much heated debate  and passion among collectors and boiled it down to it's essence.  I don't  agree with everything she claims but it is thought-provoking nonetheless.   If you collect comics and you want to gain a deeper understanding of how  our hobby has been shpaed then buy this book
