This book is mostly about how Joey deals with occurred situations that include his family and personal life. His parents are divorced and the mother has a boyfriend. His dad likes to annoy his mom and the grandmother thinks the whole family is nuts, which they are. I like this book because it talks about how to deal with bad  situations in a positive way. Joey has a lot of patience wanting to make his mom happy by acting in a mature matter, being home schooled with a bratty blind girl, and his grandmother nagging him to get a life and a friend. I like this book because of how it turns what we would consider a bad situation into a funny entertainment. In some areas of the book I feel  so sorry for how his parents get into violent situations and he feels like the third wheel and because of his family; his self esteem is in a low stage. One of the many reasons to recommend this book is because it shows not only that some families have more issues than others, but that people have thier own way of expressing thierself either in a good or bad way
