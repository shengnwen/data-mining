Elliott Jaques devised a system for analyzing executive ability based upon an individual's time horizon--the maximum period of time in the future toward which his/her work activities were aimed in their performance.  He reached this conclusion during extensive, longitudinal, empirical studies in England (see "The Changing Culture of a Factory" for example).  His series of books reflect his elaboration and extension of this finding.  He worked, for a time, with Dr. Owen Jacobs of the U.S. Army (and then the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, ICAF).  Jaques groundbreaking book, "Requisite Organization" is more pictorial than "Executive Leadership" which followed it or the later "Human Capability".  While the present work may be oriented more towards organizational structure, it is useful to practicing executives.  True, it may present an ideal which cannot, at present, be achieved, but as the Cheshire Cat said to Alice, if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there.  I wish more bosses would read Jaques' works--and carefully at that.  I bought and loaned some of them to my boss.  This volume is rather pictorial: the charts provided are engaging and thought-provoking.  The more extensive, "Executive Leadership" followed this book in sequence--it is a fine sequel..  These books are most strongly recommended for serious students and practitioners of management as well as human resource professionals.  They go far in attempting to move management into management science
