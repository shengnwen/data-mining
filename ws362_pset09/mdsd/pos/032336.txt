Inspired by John Howard Griffin's "Black Like Me", Grace Halsell decided to see how things looked through a woman's eyes.  Like Griffin, she saw a doctor and was prescribed the chemical that darkened her skin enough to pass as African-American. Then off she went to the Deep South to do her covert participant observation of white-generated racism.  

Among her ordeals is the true account of arriving at a white family's house to work as a maid, only to be accosted by the husband when the wife went away.  Luckily for Grace, the wife returned because she forgot something and saved her from probably getting raped.  The kicker is that the husband was a high official in the Ku Klux Klan, a perfect cover for his rapes of black women.  Who would believe a black woman accusing, say, Jeb Bush of rape?  Similary, no one would believe the victims of this Klansman.

The highly readable recollections of Grace's ordeals during her short time in the South lack the sociological "thick description" of Griffin's work, but the accounts are nevertheless engaging.  Halsell is an investigative journalist and her job is to share with us what happened; she doesn't dig into why this happening.  Griffin's exposure to Catholic social philosophy helps him to analyze what is happening in terms of class conflict and status relations, which are all tied to power. And Griffin is a Southerner whereas Halsell is a Northerner, and that makes a difference as well.  Nonetheless Halsell's investigative piece is a valuable compliment to Griffin's "Black Like Me"
