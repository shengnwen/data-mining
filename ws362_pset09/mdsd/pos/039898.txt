This rather thin book could have been even thinner - the first chapter, covering mostly the disastrous results of the current administration, has been done many other places, and often better.

The meat of the book is the analysis of the failures of the Democratic Party, which the authors find in a DC establishment that they view as out of touch and far too comfortable with losing as long as its own position can be maintained, even if only in a nearly powerless minority party.

This section will be very interesting for those who want a fairly close look at the mechanisms of politics, and has many good inside anecdotes from the authors's interview with political activists, party donors, and advertising and polling professionals.  And I found most of the argument made here persuasive.

The authors mention a few times that they started out to write about the 'branding' of Democrats and Republicans as a source of right wing success, and only later changed to focussing on organizational weaknesses.  They may have thrown over that first theme a little too thoroughly.  In particular, they see Republicans as having an advantage in ideas, citing George Lakoff to that effect (pp 113-114).  But the ideas that are associated almost automatically with Republicans (small government, strong defense, fiscal conservatism) are plainly branding triumphs - slogans used in political campaigns, not ideas used to govern with.
