I was asked? to read this book in my eschatology course in seminary. Everyone in our class was shocked by this book. It is simply the best explanation and commentary of Revelation you will ever read. WARNING: it  may change your eschatology forever to the preterist viewpoint. I was  particularly fascinated with the explanation of the mystery of the 144,000,  the 12 tribes of Israel, the purpose of the ORDER of these tribes, why DAN  may have been omitted, etc.  But double warning: this isn't a book  you can  scan through in 2 hours. Any layperson advanced in biblical studies will  appreciate this book. Or seminary students. Others might want to try  Paradise Restored first, another book by David Chilton that precedes the  writing of this book. Take the challenge all of you who are firmly  entrenched in dispensational premillienism (the rapture, etc.)--this book  will show you how unbiblical and weak this &quot;new theology&quot; really  is
