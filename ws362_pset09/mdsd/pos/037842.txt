Please Understand Me II  explains the reasons behind behaviors and tendencies that were only described in  Please Understand Me I - i.e., the cognitive processes and deep-seated motivations underlying action.  This gives the later book a depth not present in its merely phenomenological forerunner, and makes it a more thought-provoking read whether or not one agrees with some of its underlying basic assumptions (that temperament is inborn and immutable, that all individuals can be neatly slotted into one of the 4 categories or 16 sub-categories, and so on)
