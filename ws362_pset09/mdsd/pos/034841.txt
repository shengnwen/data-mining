In as fewest words possible , I have to praise the author here . An extremely intelligent person with an uncanny perspicacity . The chapter about jesus christ and what he really preached was most memorable . How  Philip Wylie knew this even before the dicovery of the gospel of st. thomas  is beyond me and shows how smart this man really was (1911 - 1971) .      The book's purpose was to &quot;wake you up&quot; from the fugue which you  are in from being caught up in the american way of life .    If this book  causes you to stand back and think , even for a moment , then it has done  its duty to you , and you your duty to yourself
