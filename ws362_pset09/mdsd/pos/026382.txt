Ms. Chatzky has done a lot of research, not only on the financial habits of Americans, but on what truly makes us happy, consulting with many leading happiness experts.  No surprise -- beyond a certain income level that provides the basics, money doesn't really make us happy.  In fact, stress over money -- even if we have more than enough -- can make us miserable.

She encourages us to take control of our money, which will help us take control of our lives.  Many of her suggestions are simple, but practical:  organize your papers, pay your bills when they come in, don't buy things you don't need, track your spending...  But she frames them all in the discussion of finding happiness in your life, melding the practical with the philosophical.

It's true; this book will be more useful to people whose finances are way out of control.  But I still learned a couple of things:  some guidelines for portfolio composition, that I could probably track my spending more closely, and that I should do some estate planning.

If you're not sure you need this book, live one of Ms. Chatzky's mottoes and don't buy it:  check it out of the library instead!
