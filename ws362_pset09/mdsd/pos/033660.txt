The follow up to Hitchhiker's Guide is a fun, kooky book, but failed to give me the belly laughs I enjoyed from the first one. This one seems even more "out there" if that is possible, and I enjoy the way it bends your mind and makes you contimplate possiblility in general. I'm both curious as to where the next book in the series will take me and also wonder if the expirience would be better if read whole series and one novel, rather than this serialized version
