All of the books in this series are really just sweet. As a librarian, it is refreshing to find a series that I can whole-heartedly recommend. (It gets 4 instead of 5 stars because, unlike the authors marvelous Henry &amp;  Mudge books, you cannot recommend them to everyone). This is Jane Austen  for third graders
