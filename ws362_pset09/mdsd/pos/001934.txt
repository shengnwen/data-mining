This book is yet another excellent book from Michael A. Stackpole. This book takes the Corran Horn from the X-Wing Series and develops him as much as all those books combined, and it does it well. In the 1st Person, this book lets you truly see inside Corran's head as everything happens around him. If all you want is a SW book with Luke and Han and all the other characters from the movies, you will be dissappointed. However, if what you want is a incredibly well-written book that shows a likeable character figuring out what he has to do... do not hesitate to read this book.
