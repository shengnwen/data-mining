Just graduated from Columbia, uncertain about the future and burdened by student loans, Cassie Ellis decides to become a bartender in the Village, thinking it will be the perfect job to earn a lot of money and keep her days free to work on her writing. 

But the new job proves not to be as lucrative as Cassie expected and soon she's seduced by the promised riches of the Hamptons. Working at the exclusive Spark, Cassie meets who seems to be the man of her dreams, sees plenty of snow in the summer, and finds herself completely unprepared for the new, rich world she's just entered, where pedigree trumps education, and even the trust funds come with strings attached. Overall, a very fun read
