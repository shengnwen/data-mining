It Will Never Happen to Me is a book about the children of alcoholics. This book was not hard to read in terms of language, but instead subject matter.  It was hard to read her straightforward insights without feeling pain.  I related so much to the various roles she describes children of alcoholics as typically falling into.  This book is great if you're looking for stories about people going through the same things you've gone through.  However, it doesn't offer a lot of help in terms of moving on
