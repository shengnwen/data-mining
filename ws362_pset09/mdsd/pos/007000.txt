I liked David Moorehouse's book (I read it in one day). Although it was not exactly what I was looking for. To me the incidents he described are believable and I believe that's what he saw; like with the Arc of Covenant. When you are  doing this kind of thing like he was doing "they" are showing you things which they can be intepreted in different ways. By "they" I mean the higher powers or whoever else they might be who are showing them all that stuff . They can show you anything they want you to see. Of course I believe there are ways with which you can check if what they are showing you is right or pure fiction, but you have to do it at the moment you are there and are watching the movie.This is one way I found out myself and I believe there are more. Because while you are there and your every thought becomes a reality you can question what you are seeing, I usually do this with the help of old fashioned religion and believe me it works. In some instances i've said I want to see his true form, I want to see him as he really is and not as he wants me to see him. So the truth is there you only have to ask for it. P.S. Because I am a Christian I call on Virgin Mary. The only thing is that you have to believe in whom you are calling for help.
