This book is an excellent collection of essays from a wide variety of philosophers.  This is certainly not a self-help book or an inspirational collection - it a thoughtful exploration of how the acts of cooking, eating, and thinkning have implications in feminist, post-modern, and Zen philosophy.  Some of my favorite essays looked at how cooking is goverened by social power relationships, how one's diet is a political act, and how eating is an integral part of a person's understanding of Self and Other.  I really dug this book.  Finally, the title is a great play on Martin Heidegger's &quot;Building, Dwelling, Thinking&quot;.  Check them both out
