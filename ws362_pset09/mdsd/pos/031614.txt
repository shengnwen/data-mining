I've read Suicide and Division of Labor and was interested in a historical sort of way.  Elementary Forms is positively shocking.  Pages 8-18 and 433-48 will change your life.  In those 25 or so pages he outlines a sociology of knowledge that presages the works of Mead, Berger, and the phenomenologists.  He's 50 years ahead of Merleau-Ponty's great Phenomenology of Perception which treads over much of the same material.  The rest of EFRL is interesting as well but if you read nothing else of Durkheim's read those pages.  They completely reinvigorated the stuffy "father of sociology" I had known.
