This book provides the reader with detailed and very interesting information about how kung-fu came to be. Talks about how many styles of martial arts from different regions in China evolved into an organized body which the shaolin monks, by methodically studying it, perfected into sets of movements with attacks and counter-attacks. It explains several basic moves, and stances, and then it goes into the spiritual part of kung-fu, talking about meditation, internal energy or chi, and even explains how to perform a few exercises. If you thought that kung-fu is just about the external punching and kicking, you'll be surprised how the most important part of it isn't,as explained in this book.
