Overall, a very touching story about Arturo and his familia y amigos (family and friends) and even a few malditos (bad guys). Arturo learns that, "any small goodness is of value."  

While this book focuses on a Mexican family, it may also reach children of non-Anglo descent, particularly first generation students.
