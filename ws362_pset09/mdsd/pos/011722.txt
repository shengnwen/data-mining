This book is the current discussion point of the small group of which I am apart of through my church in Indianapolis. We were guided to this book by a friend who is currently headed to Sierra Leone for missions work. As someone who has a firm grasp on global political issues, I was wary at first of reading something that I thought we just be an in-print version of a Sally Struthers commercial. 

With the first two chapters, I started to fear that my suspicions were correct. The bland facts, while startling to someone who may have a vary narrow world view, are just not that shocking in the day and age of constant streaming images from around the globe that we have today. But once past those bland chapters, the book took a sharp turn and started discussing the actual spirtual responsiblities that God has layed upon us and expects from us. This was what I needed to hear, and I can truly say that this book has really made me rethink my entire idea of giving and the need to work with the poor. 

This is an excellent book to read, whether on your own or with a small group. Also recommended for any and all who constantly call for the trimming and cutting of social programs and foreign aid. We all need to rethink where are priorities lie at times. This book will help you along that path
