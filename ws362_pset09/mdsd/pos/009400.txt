This is a very exciting and well-written book.  Shusterman develops his pragmatist perspective on the themes of aesthetic experience, urbanism, popular art and the new media. There are also illuminating analyses of multiculturalism, style, and body culture. The philosophically most original part of the book may be the two new studies that elaborate his ground-breaking theory of somaesthetics -- a body-mind discipline of theory and practice. But my favorite chapters were those on urban aesthetics, style, and genius that combine strong argument with evocatively lyrical, personal writing.  Three of the book's 10 chapters are based on earlier work from his Pragmatist Aesthetics, but they help complement the brand new chapters to turn the book into a very sustained, compelling argument. It all flows together like a great CD
