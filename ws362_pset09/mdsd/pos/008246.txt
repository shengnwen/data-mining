I'm not sure I agree with the previous review which states that this book is only for Christians. C.S. Lewis was a real skeptic and agnostic for much of his life and only slowly came to belief in Christ. His writing reflects that struggle with none of the glib self-satisfaction of so many writing "Christian" books. His ideas about pain and how it relates to our ideas about God are not unique to Christians or only applicable in that context. I think this is a book for people who are searching, who don't know what their faith is and how to proceed in the world. This is a book about also ideas.  Lewis speaks honestly about his own Christian faith and eloquently about ideas themselves but I don't think his work attempts to force or presuposes that you have reached any conclusions about religion God, life's meaning - infact his argument almost starts from the position of atheism - Lewis is also a great story teller - see Screwtape Letters, Narnia, etc
