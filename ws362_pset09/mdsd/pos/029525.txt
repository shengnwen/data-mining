MacOsko has written an excellent *reference* book; don't pick this up as your first foray into the field of rheology.  (I recommend Stephen Rosen's text for that job.)  MacOsko provides a relatively pain-free introduction  to tensors and then proceeds to apply tensor analysis to a variety of  rheological topics.  If your work doesn't require rigorous tensor analysis,  or if you're new to the field, avoid the book.  Otherwise it's a very  comprehensive and readable reference
