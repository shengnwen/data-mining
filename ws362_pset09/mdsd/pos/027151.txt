Ahh, small town life! Stradling the Mason-Dixon line, Runnymeade makes it's own rules which suits the main characters perfectly. Lots of colorful characters involved in love, hate, gossip, and typical everyday life. The pages fly by as you get to know everyone and what makes them tick. I love Ms. Brown's style; lots of details that make you want to know &quot;then what happens?&quot;, but without being boring or slow moving. I love all three books on those crazy sisters, Juts and Louise! Actually, I think they'd make an awesome tv series or movie, but sometimes things are better left to the imagination. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading Six Of One or Bingo, please do so immediately
