The writing is brilliant, with an extremely high vocabulary and a keen use of metaphor (Powers' standard).  The science is suspect but is intelligently focused more by his expertise in literary devices and the logic of langauge (or lack of) than by knowledge of neural networks and computers (of which, even still, he knows a lot).  The love story is fairly unmoving to me, and is annoying at times, though perhaps it is more realistic in that way.  The ending is stunning.

You've never read anything quite like it, and may never again, so it is worth a try.  It was the first Powers book I managed to get all the way through, and it revived the bookworm in me that was dormant for years.  He has a knack for witty dialogue (though every character is so sharp (even a young child) it's hard to believe they are not of the same mind), and descriptions of the world that would never have occurred to you.  You will be smarter after reading this.  I love my friend for passing it on to me
