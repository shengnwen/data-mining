I teach several E-commerce Courses at a University. I am using this book in an introductory E-commerce course in a graduate MBA Program. It is great! It covers e-commerce from A to Z. It contains case studies for all of the chapters to give practical experience to each of the topics as well as well described and graphical presentations of the material. I highly recommend this book either for personal study or for course study of e-commerce
