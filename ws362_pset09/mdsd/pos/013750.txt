This is my second Fitzhugh novel and boy, am I glad I stumbled across this irreverant novelist. This sometimes sad, sometimes slapstick novel was an absolute joy to read. Was the ending a bit too 'Hollywood?' Sure - what else would you expect out of this L.A. story?

Other reviewers have expressed concern over the perceived 'anti-church' bias in the book. While I am not a Catholic, I am a devout Christian and I had no problem with the jabs and pokes at the Church bureaucracy. Every denomination and organization has people that forget what the goal is and are more concerned with maintaining power and status and control than with the mission. I have no problem with anyone gently reminding (or in this case, not-so-gently reminding) everyone to keep themselves focused.
