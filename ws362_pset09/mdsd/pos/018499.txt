I read this book for the first time in the early eighties on a flight to Dallas via San Antonio, San Marcos and Austin (cheapest ticket).  It was not my first contact with Eastern Philosophy.  I attended several TM classes as a senior in high school and had always been very interested in Tibet and Buddhism.  

This book can alter your life.  It is deceptively simple.  How to live an honorable life without the violence that we are so accustomed to.  I have read it numerous times and given away all of my copies.  During the years I have had several books on my shelf that Chogyam wrote and never read them.  It seemed to be enough just to have them there sitting on the shelf radiating his wisdom out to the world from my bookshelf.  Silly, I know but my heart was opened, moved and changed by the wisdom contained in just this one book.  Working in a giant communications company and living in the southwest tail of the bible belt offered many, many opportunities to test and apply what I had absorbed from this book.  Combined with a weekly fix of New Dimensions I set about trying to live my life from the wisdom contained.   It was and still is a wonderful experience.

For those who have a difficult time in separating the message from the messinger you might try reading "The Essential Crazy Wisdom" by Wes Nisker. 

Chogyam was a great gift to America - wisdom that is desperately needed in today's times.
