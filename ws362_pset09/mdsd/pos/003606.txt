I think I've read every one of his books since I discovered 'Rage of Angels'. I came to Amazon to go through his body of work and make sure I have everything. I had no idea he had an autobiographical book out. I will buy this because this man brought a lot of joy in my life through his books and I'm really sad that he's gone. lthough he just passed, he lived a long and fulfilled life so that must be celebrated. I know this book will be good so I give it 5 stars ahead of time
