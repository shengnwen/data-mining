This book presents a good inside look at the 1989 democracy movement from the viewpoint of a key student leader.  The reader learns about some aspects of the movement that have not been widely publicized, including the trials and tribulations of one of the principal organizers of the movement.

Also, a good documentary film about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests is Carma Hinton's "The Gate of Heavenly Peace."  A condensed version of this film was broadcast on PBS Frontline in 1996
