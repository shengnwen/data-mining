This book is fantastic - having tried many different diets and fads in the past, the ideas in this book constitute the only eating 'style' that I can realistically keep going.  

I know some people have criticised Dr Phil as being overweight and possibly a divorcee and he shouldn't be writing these books - I'm not sure why he's viewed as overweight??...but I know I'd rather read books written by someone whose been there and learnt from it, than someone who had it all together from day one and doesn't understand the struggle of trying to improve their life.

It doesn't mean this book is for everyone - but for me the aspects of thinking about why I eat (or ate!) the way I do (did) really helped to keep me focussed on what I was doing. I knew what I was supposed to be doing before I read the book, I just didn't know why I was continuing to do what I did before. I am thrilled that by getting into the habit of eating better and being more active I'll be able to help my kids to have a healthy lifestyle too - its the least I owe them as a parent.
