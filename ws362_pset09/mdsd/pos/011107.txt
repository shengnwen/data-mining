As a frequent visitor to the Portsmouth, N.H. vicinity, the book was a treat.  I was able to visit the coastal area and meet realistic native and transplanted characters.  The escape was possible from my living room or coffee shop.
The author has a real grasp on investigation and much expertise on estate antique appraisal.  I never had the feeling that the events were only possible in fiction.
One area of improvement might be the solution.  Although possible, there could have been more clues.  On the other hand, the unpredictability of other suspects added to the fun.
Even a reader not familiar with the setting would profit.  They would experience the small town coastal flavor and a well written book
