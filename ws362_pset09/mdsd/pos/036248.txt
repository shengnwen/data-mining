The authors attempted to present both the personal life and scientific acheivments of Albert Einstein. I thought they did very well with the first but struggled with the latter. At the expense of a simple and equation-less presentation, many concepts were left unclear and not properly explained. In many parts, Gribbin and White just try to weasel themselves out from the tough subjects by just stating that they're complex, as if to say it's the subject's fault not theirs for the non-clarity. Surely concepts of relativity and quantum physics can be obscure, but other writers made much better attempts at explaining them to the general public.

I'm giving it four stars for the great account of Einstein's life. For a good equation-free explanation of relativity, I highly recommend Lewis C. Epstein's Relativity Visualized. As for  quantum physics, I cannot recommend this book more: David Lindley's Where Does the Weirdness Go: Why Quantum Mechanics Is Strange, but Not As Strange As You Think
