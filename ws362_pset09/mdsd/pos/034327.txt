I have enjoyed it and it has got me walking again. Which I did need. I have enjoyed how they spliced it together (CD), she looses a pager or cell phone once and in the middle of walking she does some kicks. I also listened to the audible download but the CD and book are much better. I'm not sorry I purchased it
