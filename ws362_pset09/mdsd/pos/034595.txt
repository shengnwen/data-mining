With the exception of Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, which is fiction, I've never read a book on World War II before. And aside from my interest in Cold War/atomic culture, war isn't normally on my bookshelves. But after seeing a couple of the final episodes on repeat on the History Channel of "Band of Brothers," the miniseries based on this book, I gave it a go.

Rather fascinating go it was, too. We follow the famous 101st Airborne's Easy Company from training to shortly after the war. But what we follow is not so much the events, but the people who trained, fought and were shaped by events greater than the whole. Band of Brothers gives war not just a face, but a whole company's face, and we move through the latter stages of World War II through their eyes. Ambrose's prose is as effective as the memories of those men of Easy Company who lived to tell the tale
