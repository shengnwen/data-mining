This book is fascinating.  It was written in 1927, and has not been changed since that time (though there are editorial notes with updated information).

There is a section in the beginning that talks about how to stoke your charcoal stove and how to "refresh" pork rind by boiling it.  While these parts are fun to read, they are a bit out of date.  However, when it comes to learning the "hows and whys" of cooking, 80 years means nothing.  This book provides answers and instruction pertaining to all the basic kitchen skills.  Stock preparation, basic cooking techniques, tools and ingredients are all addressed.  Many truly classic recipes are included.

The charm of this book really comes through as you read it.  It mentions many of the classic teachers of cooking, and is French to the core, but the book is not pretentious in itself.  These recipes and techniques are meant for everyday cooking in your home.  Expect instruction on how to prepare meat for braising, chicken for poaching, and how to clean fish - don't expect recipes that involve thawing or microwaving
