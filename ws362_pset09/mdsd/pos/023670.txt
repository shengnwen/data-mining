This book is the memoirs of Bob Newhart.  Bob is, of course, a comedian best known for recording several best-selling comedy albums and for starring in two very popular sitcoms (he actually starred in four sitcoms, but only two of them were "very popular").  This is a funny, entertaining book.  Bob discusses the most interesting events in his life in his own style.  He doesn't tell his life story chronologically, but rather jumps back and forth between time periods.  Chapters are usually arranged by "theme", with one chapter being about his various TV shows and another being about movies he has been in and so forth.  Being a longtime Newhart fan, I of course enjoyed reading his reminiscences.  I'm sure the rest of his fans will enjoy it, too
