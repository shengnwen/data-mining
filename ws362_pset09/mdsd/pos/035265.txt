As a non-fiction writer, it's all too easy for me to fall into a routine with my writing. I heard Bonnie speak at a writers' workshop recently, did one of the sample exercises, and was hooked. The exercises have been fun, and not only is it "forcing" me to be more creative, but it's also therapeutic, as I often seem to be writing about pet peeves or challenges on my mind. :) 

I like the fact that these are short exercises. And I also like writing in the book with a pen in a comfortable spot, instead of my fingers frantically flying across the keyboard. The exercises are definitely carrying over into my work as I think of new ways to write about ordinary topics.  

As a bonus, the pages are beautifully designed. A really unique book!
