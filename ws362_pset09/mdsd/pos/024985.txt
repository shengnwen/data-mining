This wasn't exactly what I expected:  There's no discussion of VersionCue, versioning and naming in general, or color managment.

But that said, it's a pretty good book - I'd recommend it for anyone who hasn't yet thought about what they do as a "workflow".

It offers great tips on most of the common tasks that you'll encounter with Photoshop - as well as talking about working extensively with Layers, which is essential to any intelligent workflow.

I just wish it had addressed the more complex topics I list above.  But I'm still glad I bought this book
