If only my reviews could be as interesting as this book, but then maybe if I didn't buy so many books, I'd have more time to include the details on what makes such books as this so wonderful to own.  One detail I remember from Kotulak's writing is the information on how the brain fixes itself.  When in "formal" school, I was taught so many things that simply were not true.  I'm so happy to learn that things I suspected as truth (which went contrary to what was being taught) are now being discovered (or should I say "uncovered"?) as the way things really are.
