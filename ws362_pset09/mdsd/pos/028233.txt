This book provides an incredible insight into the capitalist mindset and its (dehumanizing) treatment of employees, whereby employees are treated as objects which need to be squeezed to extract the most labor possible.  If you've seen the documentary 'The Corporation,' you might remember that time trials are routinely used in sweatshops: the amount of time for doing every little action ("hammer the nail") is specified to a 1/1000th of a second.  This book is the foundation of such management techniques.

The crucial motivation for this book comes from the realization that inefficiencies aren't just material (ie if we use less rubber in each boot, we can make more money) but inefficiencies also exist in personnel (ie this person could be working twice as fast and making us more money).

This book is fundamentally about distributed knowledge.  Just as Wikipedia has become a centralized collection of knowledge which was previously distributed across thousands of people, Taylor's "planning committee" works in a similar way: it extracting and collects and studies the workers' knowledge of their own tasks.  Upon finding the best (most efficient) methods for accomplishing each task, it redistributes that knowledge back to the workers creating a more efficient system.

An excellent and entertaining read.  Highly recommended
