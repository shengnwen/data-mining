Overall this is a great book -- engaging, insightful.  The chapters are brief, easy to read, and the reader gets a wide range of viewpoints from the various authors feautred.  The only criticism I have is that the last section, The Culture Wars, is deficient.  It covers well the conservative end of things with chapters on neo-conservatives, Reagan & Bush.  However, the book ignores Carter & Clinton.  And except for race, the book ignores civil rights issues that have been so divisive in the "culture wars," such as feminism and gay rights
