This is such a great book.  It's not the original Rudolph - if you're looking for that one, it's written by Robert May and was commissioned by Montgomery Ward in 1939.  It can usually be found locally in bookstores, and when amazon has it in stock.  It's a better story than this one - this one is just a little spin-off of the Rankin-Bass production we see on television, as the cover depicts.  It has the Yukon Cornelius, snow monster, etc. in it.  I still get goosebumps whenever I see Rudolph coming back to the Island of misfit toys to pick them up with Santa's sleigh - but that's only in the movie and not in this book.  Some things you never forget as a child and have to pass down to your own.
