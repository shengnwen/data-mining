The reader follows a simple vacuum cleaner salesman that is living in Cuba, all set before Castro becomes leader. Jim Wormold is recruited by the British government to keep an eye on goings on in Cuba. However instead of reporting fact he reports fiction, making it all up as he goes along. Watch his antics as his world turns back to front and upside down while he tries to maintain the lie he has created.

A great substitue to Graham Greene's serious spy stories that will have you laughing out loud for years to come
