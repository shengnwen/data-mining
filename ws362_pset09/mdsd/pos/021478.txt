This admittedly anecdotal account of the differences between men and women provides a great number of insights into the male experience/neuroses in 21st century America. As a man, I found it useful in appreciating my own behavior and reactions. At the same time, it was helpful to see how little an intelligent, political woman understood of the male perspective until she threw herself into it.
