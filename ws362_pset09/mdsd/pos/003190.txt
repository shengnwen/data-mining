How do I even start?  I honestly don't know what i would've done without this book.  This book, along with professional counseling helped me recover from depression and anxiety attacks.  To be brief, I had been sexually abused by 2 family members:  an older male cousin and my father.  This book helped me to finally realize that it was never my fault, and I know that now.  It's been about 10 years since I've stopped counseling, but I still have this book, and every once in a while when I start to have those feelings of guilt surfacing, I grab this book and start reading.  Recovering from childhood sexual abuse, I believe, is a lifelong process, and I'm sure we need all the help we can get.  I recommend this book to anyone who has been sexually abused, and also to anyone who knows of someone who has been sexually abused.  Maybe they can be a great help and support to them.
