I would reccomend this to anyone wishing to start photography or develop their knowledge.  Michael Langford guides you through photography jargon and explains digital, APS and SLR cameras with ease.  Including projects for practical starting points easy enough for a total beginner with only a disosable camera or professionals with the latest stuff!  The book covers using your first camera, lighting, trouble shooting, effects, working indoor and outdoors and briefly about making your own dark room.  It is a comprehensible guide which doesn't cost a packet!  A definite thumbs up
