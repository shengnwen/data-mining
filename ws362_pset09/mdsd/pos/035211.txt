Consistent with his other text I have read (Pursuit of Holiness, etc.), Jerry Bridges brings a good and balanced biblical view to his writing.  While he clearly states he does not wish judge anyone in his writing, Bridges also clearly challenges the reader to not take God's grace so lightly since it cost Him so much - namely His Son Jesus Christ.

The first part of the book is spent clarifying what grace is and what our part is in growing more in God's grace.  The second part mainly concerns how we can actually grow.  Whether a new or mature believer, you will benefit from the reading.

The last few chapters are spent discussing how God will mature us through:  commitment, convictions, choices, watching, and adversity.  Included in these chapters are how we can experience spiritual growth when we obey God's leading and determine to apply these truths.  In short, Bridges throughout the book maintains a balance between God's grace and what we have to do to experience that grace and growth.

All in all, an excellent read.  Read and enjoy
