Alan Lightman, Senior Lecturer in Physics at MIT and author of the recent best-seller _Einstein's Dreams_, serves up four fundamental concepts that form the foundation of modern physics in an easy-to-read, comfortable manner.  Not being a physics buff, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease with which Lightman commands and communicates his subject.  After developing a beginner's understanding of the conservation of energy, the second law of thermodynamics, the theory of relativity, and quantum mechanics, it is fascinating to watch each of these ideas find traction in the world around you.  For those who might view physics as an esoteric field that bears no real relevance to the lives of ordinary people, Lightman encourages them to look at the impact of these ideas, not only the science of the modern world, but on the social, spiritual, and intellectual aspects of the modern era as well.  By weaving passages from writers, philosophers, theologians, and social theorists, Lightman explores the wide-ranging impact that physics has had on every academic field imaginable.    

While some may find the text to be pedestrian and lack the hard math of more ambitious texts, this book is not geared towards experts and should not be considered anything more than a fun read for the informed.  If you're ready to begin exploring the world of physics, this is a nice place to start.  Just be prepared to view the world differently after you're done.
