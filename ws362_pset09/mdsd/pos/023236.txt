The Parent's Handbook: Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (Step)
By Don Dinkmeyer Sr., Gary D. McKay, & Don Dinkmeyer Jr.  

    The authors of "Systematic Training for Effective Parenting" admit that living with teenagers is at best a challenging, and often a daunting, experience. They maintain that it is necessary to appreciate, respect and love one another. The book emphasizes natural and logical consequences, encouragement, belonging, parent-child communication skills, understanding, and family meetings.
