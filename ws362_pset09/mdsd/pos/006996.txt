Karkkainen is Finnish, teaching occasionally at Fuller Seminary, I gather.  Don't let the Fuller connection (or the blurp from Roger Olson - uptight postevangelical) scare you off. Karkkainen's own view point may seem less orthodox than many would like (including this reader),
but this is a WONDERFUL survey of all the streams of thought throughout
Church history and across the globe.  I really wish I had this when I was in
the intro. courses at seminary.  It is INCREDIBLY ACCESSIBLE and lucid.  He
will summarize the unique contribution and distinctiveness of say Locke or
Pannenberg in one sentence, without oversimplifying.  Its stunning how
good this guy is at summarizing ideas and contrasting them with others.  It
is very irenic too.

Karkkainen is comfortable in his own skin and just unapologetically revels in his ecumenical neo-orthodoxy.

A great read for those secure and mature in their own theology and not looking to adopt Karkkainen's views, but to use him to understand other positions.
