I just got done reading The Rescue last night. I just didn't like the part when Taylor blamed himself for his father's death. He had a right to be happy and live his life. The boy really likes Taylor. Denise was a sweet lady. I am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a Dad. You might want to read that book again. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. I have been his fan for 1 year and a month. I love all his stories, I will be looking forard to the next one in October
