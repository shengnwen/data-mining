As Maggie and Ira Moran drive to and from an old friend's funeral, readers get insight into their entire 28-year relationship. The type of woman who tells grocery store clerks her entire life story, Maggie is now determined to take a detour by her former daughter-in-law's hometown, where she will attempt to cajole Fiona into reuniting with the Morans' son Jesse. Ira - Maggie's polar opposite - firmly believes in letting the past remain the past, and not meddling in others' business.

As the story of Fiona and Jesse further unravels, it becomes apparent that the two had the deck stacked against them from the start. Pregnant with daughter Leroy at 17, Fiona was coaxed into marrying Jesse and moving in with the Morans, despite her reservations. Yet even after the marriage fell apart, Maggie is dead set on getting her family back to the way she thinks it should have been.

Like most Tyler novels, there are no easy fairy tale endings here. In fact, when the story ends, I found it difficult to say whether the protagonists had learned anything from their experiences...or whether everything had stayed exactly the same as it was before the drive to the funeral.
