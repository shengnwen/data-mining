Valerie Worth's prose and poetry as shown in this book evince  an unusual quality and delicately-wrought workmanship - the atmospheric spells are her own unique compositions but seem to be inspired by a range of influences from European and American folk-sorcery to Medieval and Graeco-Egyptian Magic: the text is evocative indeed and i must say that the book is a real treat to the connoisseur of magical poetics. It's the apparent simplicity of her voice which  makes for an ambience of authenticity and mystery and her finely-honed ability to conjure beautiful imagery via the music of the words. The seasonal rites are quite exquisite, delectable compositions, wonderfully-crafted and strange ceremonial dramas. This is a unique and beautiful little grimoire - the poet's lightness of touch captures something of that rare and elusive shimmer of genuine Magic which is experienced only by starlight and candlelight
