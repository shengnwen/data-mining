i'm still reading the book, but i'm really liking it. it's the story of a young woman who has just lost her husband to cancer and is dealing with her grief, but in the most unusual ways. she does things that aren't "textbook" for widows, which tends to bother some people, but pretty much confuses her and makes for a good read. so far, i'd recommend it to the person that likes to read about real emotion mixed with comedy
