For anyone wanting to get into standup comedy and not develop bad habits, this book should be your primary source, and essential tool. It shows you not only how to write the funny, and I mean REALLY funny, but also how to rehearse, how to get gigs, how to win the crowd and club staff over to liking and supporting you, it's got it all. Every single piece of advice Greg gives in the book is absolutely spot on. It made such a change in my on-the-mic presence that I think I'm approaching the point where I will be "unbombable", as I call it. Below is an email I wrote to Greg thanking him for sharing his knowledge.

Hi Greg,

I tried Standup Comedy in January this year. Being a fan of comedy all my life I thought I'd be good at it. I sucked. I was horrible. I didnt want to give up though, I knew I was missing something. In short, I bought your book, read it cover to cover, and followed all guidelines from jokewriting to mining for material, assembling acts, ....I even setup a mic and stand in my basement for rehearsals. Of course, though, I have another room for the critic's voice. I also joined toastmasters. All of it together made my second open mic attempt very successful. I was confident, smooth, and all but a couple of punchlines did well. It was all because of your book. You are a freaking genius.

I love you, man. Thank you
