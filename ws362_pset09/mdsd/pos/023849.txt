I first heard about this book from a good review article in Sky and Telescope magazine and thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall, this book succeeds as a primer on Variable Star observing. And, for variable star observers, this is definitely a must-have book.

Although the beginning of the book provides in-depth information on how to do variable star observing, the real strength of this book comes later when the authors explain what is going on inside the stars which cause the observed variability.  Again, the authors are very thorough in providing explanations for all of the different types of variable stars.  The book also comes with an easy to use CD containing star charts and variable light curves which supplement the book very well.
