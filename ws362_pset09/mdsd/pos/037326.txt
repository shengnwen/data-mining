This was a pretty good synopsis of the show.  It included some info about the characters and the stars of the show.  The synopsis of each show was pretty good.  It included interesting information and facts along with some of the memorable dialogue.  Granted I think a whole book could be published with just the interesting and humorous dialogue alone.The author like most of us Stargate Fans has her favorite episodes and I agree for the most part about the episodes she says are not that great.  All in all it is a good resource.  I am giving it four stars for that.

One thing I wish it had was more information about the names of the peoples and places the team visit.  Everything named in the Stargate univiverse has a reference either to mythology or the ancient world.  I thought some more information about that would be helpful
