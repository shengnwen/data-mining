The executioner of Wittgenstein's estate, GH von Wright selected numerous notes that concerned general sort, culture, and religion in this book. He first tried to include only the best remarks, but eventually he decided to include everything. The remarks are arranged in chronological order, not by subject. It has an index, but not so meticulous one. 

Majority of subject covers music (8 notes for Beethoven, 5 for Mozart, 9 for Mendelssohn), religion, faith and God. I was struck by his indifference to political affair though. He himself was a homosexual Austrian Jew and his family was at serious risk during Nazis era, yet there is almost no reference to Nazis, Third Reich or Fuhrer (Contrast this to Einstein, Oppenheimer, Heidegger or Russell!).

Although it is generally regarded that the ordinary language philosophy was dead in 60's, it is still worth reading. For instance, on Christianity, he says : "Christianity is not based on a historical truth; rather, it offers us a historical narrative and says: now believe! .....Here you have a narrative, don't take the same attitude to it as you take to other historical narratives! ... There is nothing paradoxical about that!" According to a recent poll, 80% of American believe in the virgin birth of Jesus. Some social critics deplore the degradation of our scientific education, but I am not sure that if that's the right attitude.
