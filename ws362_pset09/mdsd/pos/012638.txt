I read this book as a teenager and then again last year (I'm in my early thirties now). I agree with the reviewer (also in her thirties) who said that the book made her feel like a teenager when she was reading it. It does transport you right back there. 

A SLIPPING DOWN LIFE is Tyler's third published novel. If you come to it after reading ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, SAINT MAYBE, and other more recent novels, you may be disappointed--unless you read it without thinking of it as "An Anne Tyler Book." When not standing side-by-side with these later books, A SLIPPING DOWN LIFE stands quite well on its own.

It's an excellent book about a young woman on the cusp of adulthood who begins to take control of her life in the way that a seventeen-year-old with no mother and nearly absent (even when he's in the house with her) father might do. She learns from her actions and choices, however. The end is neither suprising nor sad; Evie grows up, and I have little doubt that she'll do much better in the rest of her adult life than she with the start of it
