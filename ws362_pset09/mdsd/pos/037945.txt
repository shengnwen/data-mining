For those who said this book doesn't have anything you couldn't find in your local library.  Well, duh.  This book doesn't have anything you couldn't find in the library, or faster yet, online.  The entire point is the organization, having everything at hand in a concise manner. You'd have to do some searching and clicking to get all the information about one subject that this book stuffs into a few pages, and you wouldn't get them in concise, logical order without repetition.  Obviously, this book doesn't go ultra in depth or cover every subject area.  Even whole encyclopedia sets can't do that.  The best part of the book, in my opinion, is it tells you what you need to know.  If you want to be fairly knowledgeable in any given subject really quickly, its useful to not have to read a lot of books/internet sources and then figure out what part of the information you can/should retain
