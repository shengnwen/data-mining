This is a good book for people who want to begin eating responsibly, and the second half has a pile of yummy recipes.  But vegetarianism oughn't to be about just our health and appearance.  It's a chosen way of life that helps us live in harmony with the animal kingdom, that shows we're taking responsibility for the environment and for our fellow creatures.  It's a moral choice, or ought to be, first and foremost.  So supplement Robbin's book with others like The New Vegan or Ethical Vegetarianism from Pythagoras to Peter Singer
