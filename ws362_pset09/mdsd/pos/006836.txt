While other reviewers have covered the bread aspects of this book quite well, I wanted to mention the little recipe tucked in the back for &quot;Perfect&quot; buttermilk pancakes. I am a pancake addict and these are truly the best pancakes I have EVER had. The sourdough pancakes on the following page are quite good as well, but the buttermilk recipe is perfection. Unlike some artisan bread books (i.e. The Bread Bible), Crust and Crumb is detailed and intricate but entirely clear in its instruction. I highly recommend it for the serious bread baker
