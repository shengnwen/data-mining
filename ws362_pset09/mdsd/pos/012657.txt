I just finished reading this book and I very much enjoyed it. The characters are well developed, although from many areas of the world and the setting flits around. The only things that stood out to me as being very unrealistic is how so many people could have the same initial (K) and also how so many connected people could be on one train at the same time without each other knowing! But the ending is very good-not what I thought it would be at all. For a good read, I recommend this book though
