Tab Hunter was one of the last of the `contract' movie stars, and arrived just as the Hollywood studios were going into decline.  This biography is an interesting insight of those last days of the star system.  However, what sets this book apart from many others of its kind is that Tab Hunter does not dish the dirt on his fellow actors.  As a result, we are given a glimpse of how difficult is was for those stars who found themselves bound by contracts signed when they were on the way up, and then found themselves unable to `work their craft', because the studio system was collapsing around them.

Reading between the lines, the reader gets to know something of the `real' Tab Hunter, as opposed to the `Sigh Guy', that we all saw on the silver screen.  Through the uncertain years that he faced after buying himself out of his Warner Bros. contract, he kept his feet firmly on the ground when he could have gone the way of so many others before him, and ended up a bitter has-been. 
 
Nevertheless, do not take my word for it, read this book for yourself and you too will better appreciate how he has sustained such a long run as a genuine person as (in his own words), "an ex-Movie Star".  I have read it twice, and both times found it a very good read
