While it may strike some as self-indulgent (turning 9/11 into a food event struck me as odd) this is nonetheless a very entertaining book. The recipes that accompany it are well worth trying and are written so that even less accomplished cooks can have success. Even if New York foodies are a turn off for you, you will enjoy this book
