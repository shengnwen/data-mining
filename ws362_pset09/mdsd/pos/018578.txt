If you are a busy family like mine with several activities/dr. appts. for various family members you will love this calendar!  It is nice and big with plenty of room to write.  I love that the day is divided into morning, afternoon and evening too.  You may miss the fact that there is not a beautiful picture on every month to look at, but you will love that that room is taken up with more space to write
