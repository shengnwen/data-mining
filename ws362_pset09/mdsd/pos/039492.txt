This book does not cover the in-depth mechanics behind the scripting language.. Stuff most people find their eyeballs rolling around in their head while trying to read. Instead it takes the 'common man' approach and presents admin scripting in a practical, easy to implement way. I recommend this book for admins who are not very experienced with vbscript and want to be able to learn and produce workarble scripts quickly. It also comes with a CD of sample scrips, labs and a ebook copy of the book.
