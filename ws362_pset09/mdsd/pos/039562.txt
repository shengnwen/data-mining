This is the other bible I am currently reading, this is the one I carry in my backpack. It has a very study metal shell, thus it's name, it has a magnetic clasp to keep it closed. I pretty much killed a bible about every year to year and a half by carrying it around in my backpack every day. This bible solves that problem. It is small, compact, and very durable. The metal Bible comes in a variety of colors and designs I have this green one with the dog tags and my wife had my initials engraved in the dog tag before giving it to me as a gift a few summers ago. There are currently, 2 Silver designs, black, orange, red and hot pink. The NLT - New Living Translation is also a great reading edition, both this and the TNIV are newer translations based on modern scholarship and are very accessible to today's readers.


Note: The Silver, Green and Orange are old stock and are NLT version1 the red and vlack are the NLT Second Edition. Next reprint of the others will be the revised NLT
