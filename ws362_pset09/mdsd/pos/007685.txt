When Amelia Bedelia, the housekeeper who literally takes everything literally, brings Mrs. Rogers her cereal with coffee, the woman takes one look at those flakes floating around in her coffee cup and fires Amelia before she gets a chance to fill her creme puffs. Amelia, one who always sees the bright side of life, sets out to find a job. First she goes to work in a beauty shop, but when she's told to pin up a customer's hair and does it with pins from her purse, she is fired. Then she finds work in a dress shop as a seamstress, but she shortens all the dresses with a scissors and is fired. As a file clerk, she stamps on the letters with her feet when told to stamp them and files papers with a fingernail file when told to file them. And when she goes to work for a doctor, well, you'll just have to read this book to your child to find out what mischief she gets into there. Fortunately she makes a terrific cream puff, because when she remembers she forgot to fill them and goes by the Rogers', they hire her back, because those cream puffs are just oh so good.

My son Devon is fast approaching three. He knows his letters, upper and lower case. He knows they make words and he loves to sit while I read Amelia Bedelia stories to him. We've been doing it for over a year now. At first I made up the story line as his didn't have the attention span or the ability to understand. Now I've started reading, pointing to the words as I go along. Ms. Parish has written an excellent series for children and in this one, Wallace Tripps illustrations set off Amelia's tales to a tee. If you want your toddler to read early, and I do, then this is a series for you.
