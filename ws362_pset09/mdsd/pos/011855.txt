Forget about all the negative reviews about this book!!! They are completely wrong. I can't believe those people didn't get more out of this book. First, it's called "Inside the Postal Bus". Sure it has Lance in the SUB-title, but that doesn't mean this book is "all about Lance". If that's what they wanted, they obviously can't read a title let alone a sub-title, and they should stick to books that have a hugh pictures of Lance on the cover so they don't get so confussed.

For TRUE cycling fans (and NOT the-Lance-bandwagon crew) this is one great cycling book. Michael Barry does give plenty (yes plenty) of accounts of what went on in the US Postal bus. He also gives accounts of stays in hotels, in European cities that are hubs for non-European born cyclist, and plenty of road racing. A real insider's view.

O.k., Barry didn't race in the Tour de France alongside Lance, but the title doesn't say he did. A true fan would know that there is life outside of the Tour de France and the US Postal Team has more than one rider. And such a fan would also want to know about other races and riders. 

Barry gives plenty of stories about other riders (George Hincapie, Floyd Landis, Dave Zabriskie, and plenty more) and also US Postal Team staff. Great stories-and well told. This is an easy to read, enjoyable book about life in and out of the US Postal bus, the glory, the pain, and the triumphs of wins both big and small. I'm glad I happened to catch Michael Barry signing copies of his book at the final stage of the inagural Tour of California.
