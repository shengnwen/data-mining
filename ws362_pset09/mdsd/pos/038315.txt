In 1942, J. Robert Oppenheimer gathered six of the top theoretical physicists in the U.S. gathered in Berkeley to discuss how to go about making the first atomic bomb.  One of them was Robert Serber.  When Los  Alamos opened in March, 1943, Serber gave a series of lectures based on  that conference, so everyone would have a common frame of refernce for the  work to come.  They were then written up as Los Alamos publication #1,  classified Top Secret, and given to every scientist joining the project.   Here they are, with a nice introduction by Richard Rhodes, (author of THE  MAKING OF THE ATOMIC BOMB and DARK SUN: THE MAKING OF THE HYDROGEN BOMB;  both recommended), and extensive annotations by Serber, covering (among  other things) where they were right, were they were wrong, and how to  discuss nuclear weapons in front of the contruction personal without them  figuring out what you're talking about.  Essential for anyone seriously  interested in the Manhatten Project or The Bomb
