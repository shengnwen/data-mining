i had hesitated at spending $30 on a book that i could not see. when i received it i knew it was money well-spent.

the 17 patterns of adorable animals (in various small sizes perfect for holding in one's hand and tucking in one's pockets) are so very precious and heartwarming that its hard not to melt before you reach for your needles.

the book is well written with clear directions, drawings, and photos. the author encourages the use of natural fibers like mohair and angora. the patterns require very basic knitting skills - garter, stocking, increase, decrease, pick up 1 stitch. the needle sizes used are from 2-7 (u.s.)

there are cute verses introducing most of the critters. this is my favorite, for the very appropriately named 'cuddly bunny': "Warning! if you begin knitting this toy, you must count on being surrounded by children with a hopeful look in their eyes." this book will give you a case of the giggles.

what i love the best is how these critters are so unique in design. these are not the run-of-the-mill animal patterns that we've all seen over and over again. foxes, chicks, ducks, bears, cats, daschound, bunnies, piglets, horses, and more.--even a little hedgehog! these are very special knitted animals indeed
