I've heard about the hype of Yoga, even went to a class at my gym.  It was intriguing, and I stretched my body in ways I didn't know possible.  But where was the continuation? Where was the follow up?  That, sadly, was up to me.

But I did not fear; I merely purchased Yoga in Bed.  I was slightly skeptical, but upon receiving the book I headed over to my bed to try it out.  My cats were a little freaked out by me stretching to unknown lands, but they've since adjusted.  As has my body.  

I had a lot of lower back pain, and while I still do occasionally I've benefited and slept better because of the simple stretches in the book.  I don't know if I would recommend this to veteran Yoga participants, this is a book for people who don't know what the hype is about but maybe want to check it out at home before committing to a class.  Great way to stretch in the morning, and wake up refreshed
