This volume is a great thing to have if you want to be a comic book artist.  It has a large variety of information on how to draw comic books in the style of today's popular artists written by the popular artists themselves.  Some of the sections of the book are amazing.  There are a few that aren't so great, but the book is still well worth the investment.  Each of the many contributing authors of the book has a different level of ability to teach, but the information is definately there in one way or another.  When using books like this it is good to keep in mind that it is best to learn a style once you study real anatomy and draw from life.  You can't really learn how to draw anatomy merely from looking at and interpreting the drawings of others.  You must draw from life.  Learning just a drawing style with out a real art foundation will hurt you more than help you so while this book is great, it shouldn't be the beginning and end of your self education to become a comic book artist.  I feel this book is much more helpful than "How to draw comics the Marvel way"
