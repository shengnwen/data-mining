I truly enjoyed this personal, interesting, and easily relatable account of a life lived with one's head in a book. Nelson's writing is peaceful and quiet, but compelling, and I enjoyed hearing about the ways in which her reading life intersected with her everyday life. This book doesn't have reviews so much as a flowing commentary on how whatever book she was reading impacted her, made her think, brought up old memories and feelings... 

I felt like I was with a friend, for sure
