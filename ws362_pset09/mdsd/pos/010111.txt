...but the plot was good too.  This book might suffer a bit from character bloat.  There was potential here for a series of books and far more character development; some actors are given short shrift which is made even sadder by the fact that the author has managed to make each and every one interesting and engaging.

While our view of a very intriguing world is narrowed to just a few points in time that hop about a bit, there's still a lot to be had.  This book does a great job at evoking the feelings of isolation and contempt for greater society the standard mutant outcast fiction never quite accomplishes.  We are made to feel the fear of normal humans as well as the barely-containable desire for revenge and untapped and perhaps unlimited power of our heroes and anti-heroes.

Great execution and wonderfully written prose had me turning the pages as fast as I possible could.  Great book, worth a read and a few re-reads
