Dirk Pitt wanders through an epic journey involving nerve gas, political kidnapping, mind control, and not one, but two evil powers.  Key to the plot is the takeover of the US government.  As a retired USAF officer, I was dismayed to see the military fall in line with dictatorial control (they are sworn to uphold the Constitution, rather than the President).  The rescue involving the Lousiana "good ole boys" was particularly fun to read.  Overall, the Washington leaders were portrayed with somewhat juvenile characters, but nevertheless, the story is fun
