Thank you so much for putting into easy to understand words so that regular people will know what 'unattached' and 'unbonded' mean. We were dealing with many of those issues with a child we became guardians of. We knew something wasn't right but did not know what. We looked on the internet, talked with friends and family, asked at our local library for help. After reading 20 books on the subjects of adoption and foster parenting we finally came up with 'High Risk' and everthing came together. We were in shock at first until we read that not all psychopaths exhibit all the symptoms outlined in the book. Our child had many of them and we felt better because we became empowered by this knowledge and were able to move ahead and try to help him and our situation. I recomend this book to anyone who can read. It should be a must for anyone contemplating becoming a parent. Please help these children by not creating them first. Please help them by reading this book and taking the next steps.
The doctor tells us it will be years of therapy before he may bond again. Until then we will do whatever it takes to help him. 
Good luck to those who suffer with this problem
