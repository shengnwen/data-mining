The Complete Idiot's Guide to Slow Cooker Cooking is great.  I was determined to learn the basics of slow cooking and take advantage of my new slow cooker, but was at a loss as to where to start.  The Idiot's Guide not only has some great recipes - both basics and unusual - but lots and lots of general tips that can be applied to other recipes.  I really like that element because I can only follow recipes for so long before my brain starts to wander and I want to do my own thing.  Knowing what works and doesn't work in general in slow cookers is invaluable.
