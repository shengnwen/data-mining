Ah, yes they are back, after twenty years D'Artagnan, Athos, Aramis, and Porthos are reunited.  D'Artagnan is still a Musketeer.  Athos is living at his country estate, no longer the drunkard of earlier days he finds happiness through his Son Raul.  Aramis is now a priest, but becoming a priest he is even more so a cavalier.  And good Porthos is rich.  This is every bit as good as the Three Musketeers, and it is great to see our old friends again.  Their charaters deepen, and we see them aged, but still themselves.  In this book we see that last time the four are all united together for a common cause.  The great thing about these novels is that it has its share of swash-buckling action, but there is more to these charaters than their strong sword arms.  They are clever, and each uses their own stengths to the advantage of the entire group.  They are true friends, and realize that though they may champion contrary causes, they are never enemies of each other.

Just to coment on the total of the D'Artagnon Romances just to clear up something for those reading some of the other reviews. Some reviewers refer to them as a trilogy, while there is, indeed, 5 books in the series.  It is still a Trilogy.  There are three complete stories, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte De Bragelonne.  The last of these stories is broken up into three volumes which are The Vicomte De Bragelonne (part 1), Louise de la Valliere (part 2), The Man in the Iron Mask (part 3)
