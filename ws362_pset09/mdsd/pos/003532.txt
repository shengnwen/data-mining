I am stationed in Iraq currently home on R&R leave. This book is like a Bible for us guys who need quick answers. We have our folks send the herbs and homeopathic remedies to us. I am bringing back a s--- load of herbal pills from Walmart back with me in my pack. That is the best way to take personal stuff to Iraq.Waiting for packages can take months.

 Homeopathic belladonna was given to me by my medic and it brought down my fever. OVer there 100 degrees is a cool day. That is great news to have something that works well, fast and has no side-effects. 

Asian Health Secrets should be on everybody's shelf. Yunnan Paiyao, a medicine made in China available anywhere chinese people live can save lives. It stops excess bleeding from wounds, bug bites--we have some incredible spiders in Iraq--and Yunnan Paiyao heals anything fast. It reduces pain and stops hemmorage. That information alone is worth the book. It is a great book. Buy it
