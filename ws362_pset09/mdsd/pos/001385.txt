The Washington Post originally reviewed this book by saying, "It is remarkable to read such a terrifying work expressed in such a seductively reasonable voice."

After reading this book, I'd say that that reviewer was right on target, with one exception.  I'd change "remarkable" to "remarkable and a bit unnerving".  While reading this book, it is easy to forget how horrifically dark the story line is, until you stop reading long enough to think about it.  Then it hit's you like a brick.  But then you pick the book up and continure reading, because you can't wait to discover what unspeakable thing occurs next in the lives of this perfectly "normal" family. 

This is a good book.  Usually I'm sad when I finish a good book, because when the book is finished I immediately miss the fact that I am no longer deeply involved in the story.  But when I finished this book, I wasn't sad.  I was relieved to have been set free.  That's actually to Scott's credit.  He's a remarkably skilled writer.
