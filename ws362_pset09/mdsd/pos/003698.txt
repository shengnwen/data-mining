This is a mini preview of a parenting method that is amazing.  Love and Logic WORKS!!  It does not matter the age of the child or behavior of the child...ADHD, to sweet angel.  I have used this parenting method on my 10 month old and it works.  My sister-in-law introduced me to Love & Logic before I was even a parent to start preparing.  I read this book over and over again, along with the many other resources Love & Logic provides.  Look up the other books and get them, it will be worth every penny...it will be priceless knowledge!
