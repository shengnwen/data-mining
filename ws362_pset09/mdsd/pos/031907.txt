Act Of Creation: A Story Of Superpowers, Secret Agents, Wartime Allies And Enemies And Their Quest For A Peaceful World by Stephen C. Schlesinger (former speech writer and foreign policy advisor to New York Governor Mario Cuomo), is an informed and informative study of the foundation of the United Nations, and diverse nations (some who had been formally hostile to one another during the horrific years of World War II) came together in their struggle to create a world where nations settled their difference in discussion rather than on the battlefield. An in-depth and detailed saga of nations and individuals, closely researched in accordance with an impeccable scholarship, and superbly organized for contemporary readers, Act Of Creation is a welcome contribution to Political History reference collections and International Studies reading lists
