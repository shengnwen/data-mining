Phil's story has a very differnt tone, a married cop, machines with slightly different motives, and much more back story on earth and what is motivating folks.  I think in making the movie it was best to cut out the marriage as well as the backstory on why people all crave to have their very own animal such as sheep, horse, goats, cats and yes even electric sheep. 
Nevertheless I loved this book for all its differences
