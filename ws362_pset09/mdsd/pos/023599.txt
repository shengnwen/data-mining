Kissinger provides a great analysis of US F. Policy, as well as in what direction it should be taken. I wish my International Relations teacher used this in class! He goes over the important events of 20th century analyzing (from a realist perspective) them. He gives an image of where American policy should be taken, as well as a historical overview of the major theoretical approaches in IR. Even if you don't agree with his positions, the book is packed with substantive accounts. I def. recommend this book no any1 interested in foreign police or 20th century history.
