This book was about a fifteen year old girl, named Daisy living in England with her cousins she has never met. As the war moves closer to them, the cousins grow closer to one another, and Daisy realizes how she loves her cousin, Edmond. When they are forced to leave, Daisy and Edmond are split apart. Daisy and her nine year old cousin, Piper, journey back home through all of the bad conditions of war: starvation, no shelter, and the thought of being seen and killed. When Daisy and Piper finally arrive home, they do not see Edmond or Issac.  This book is full of suspense and worry about losing the people you love. Overall, I liked this book, but some parts about the war were written with a lot of detail that was upsetting. I would recommend this book
