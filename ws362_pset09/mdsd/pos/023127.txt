I got this book when my son was 13 months. He loved it and now that he is 18 months he still does. the colors are bright and different in all the pages, the sentences are short enough to keep the baby's attention on the story, and I found the book great to teach opposites. Now when I read the book and I say "the porridge was too hot" my son can complete the next sentence "the porridge was too COLD". And so on with the rest of the story. I say it's a great book
