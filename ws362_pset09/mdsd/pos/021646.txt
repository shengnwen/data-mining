Are you reading Tobias Wolff yet?  Are you?  If not, you should be.  

With Back in the World, Wolff gives us yet another outstanding compilation of short stories.  As always, Wolff's stories are brief and absolutely potent, offering all the complexities and awkwardness of the human condition in a direct and entrancing manner.  His stories are so rooted in everyday life that when something unusual takes place it reminds us just how odd life can sometimes be in the middle of all the humdrum.  Never does he take us beyond the possibilities of reality, however, and I believe that's why I so remarkably relate to his work.

I unconditionally recommend all of Wolff's writings, and Back in the World is certainly not to be excluded.
