A very fitting end to the 'Texas Empire' series. Madeleine Hardin fled to Texas to escape the horror of what had happened to her in New Orleans. In the wild land of Texas, Maddy tries to realize her dream of running a  cattle ranch, the Longhorn, alone. But a lot of dreams died during the  Civil War, and Maddie is afraid hers did too--until a Yankee soldier shows  up. Daniel Kent had been fascinated with the beautiful Maddie, but he never  knew why she fled New Orleans. Now he has a chance to know her again, but  Maddie is different. Life has changed her in a lot of ways. Dan has to  admit he loves Maddie, but can he accept everything that happened to her?  And what about the secret she's keeping from him? Evelyn Rogers' books  continually and without exception delight her readers. Longhorn finishes  the Texas Empires series with Maddie's story, a romance which certainly  satisfies and finishes off what happens to all of the Hardin family and  their loves in the wild free land of Texas where Empires are made
