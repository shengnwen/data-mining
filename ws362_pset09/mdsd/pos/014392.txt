THE MAMMY by Brendan O'Carroll
April 7, 2007

Amazon Rating 5/5 stars 

I loved THE MAMMY by Brendan O'Carroll. It's funny, sad, and inspirational all in one. THE MAMMY in some ways reminded me of ANGELA'S ASHES by Frank McCourt, in that both take place in Ireland and both focus on poverty and ill fortune, but told with a light hearted and often times funny voice. 

The Mammy is Agnes Browne, who at the start of this novel is a newly made widow. Her husband Redser Browne had just died, and she is doing what she needs to do, file the papers so she can get the money from the government due to her, the widow. 

I have to say that every little thing that happens in this book, there is a funny spin on it, as Agnes always looks at the bright side of life, no matter how dark things become. And no matter how hard things get for Agnes, she stays strong. She's got seven children to feed and it's not easy. Her oldest acts like he's the new man of the house, and each of the other children have their own distinct personalities that makes this story richer. Agnes makes a living by selling produce on Moore Street, standing next to her best friend Marion. Between the two of them, the laughs come fast and hard, even when Marion's health is on the line. 

THE MAMMY is just one of four in this series of books about a poor Irish family living in the heart of "the Jarro". I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
