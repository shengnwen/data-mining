The central figure in this volume is the Baron de Charlus. Everybody else seems to me to be relative to him. His homosexiality is a passion that is not only sexual, but also intellectual and seems to run parallel to the disintegration of this society he loves so much. I never have read a believable description of a character of such arrogance and vanity, yet posessed of such human frailty. A very disquietening classic
