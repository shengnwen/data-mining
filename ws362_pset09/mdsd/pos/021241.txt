i have to agree w/ the other reviewers: all of vaughan's books for ult. x-men up to now have been varying shades of terrible and unreadable. this book does a good job of redeeming him, and makes us wonder what the problem was before. the story is fairly solid, the cast is there (introduces ult. mystique), and we get to see emma frost, cypher, cannonball, sunspot, havok, polaris, and northstar. there are some less-than-believable moments, but overall it works and def. lays the foundation for some good stories to come. has def. got me back to looking forward to ult. x-men instead of dreading it
