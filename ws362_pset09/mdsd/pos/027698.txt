This book is a must have for any witch.  Each holiday is written about in great detail with accompanying recipes, crafts, and rituals for group or solitary practice.  I would highly reccommend this book, my only complaint being that (like most books on witchcraft) there is an element of revisionist history.  The author doesn't really cite her historical sources.  It is still a wonderful resource, however
