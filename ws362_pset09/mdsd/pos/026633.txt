For a read thats compelling, as well as disturbing at the same time, check out this book by terrorism expert Steven Emerson.  Well researched, and well written. As disturbing a book as it is impressive. 

If an independent author can find out so much information about terrorists living in our own country, why isnt our government doing more to root out and deport these people? I'm guessing we won't really pay attention to some of these homegrown terrorists till after the NEXT 9/11-type incident happens. So sad. 

This book should be required reading for every Congresssman and Senator in America. Steve Emerson definitely gets it. Its a shame "they" don't get it.
