Mr. Elnser has taken us inside the prison systems throughout American and given us the reality of what most people don't want to think about.  As an American citizen and taxpayer I was sickened to know that prison abuse is alive and well within this land of milk and honey.  Mr. Elsner is brutally honest as he describes the various forms of abuse within the gates of justice.  One does not need to be associated with elected officials, correctional officers or inmates to realize that something is seriously wrong with the ever growing prison system.  
As a law abiding citizen of this country I do realize that I am responsibile for something once I become aware of it.  Much like the concentration camps in Germany, doing nothing to help is a far greater sin than trying to claim ignorance.  I highly recommend this book to all citizens in American so that they may come to realize we have a brutal system in place and justice is not always what it may seems.
We must cry out for the men and women being treated inhumanely throughout the United States.  I thank Mr. Elsner for his candid and honest review of a system out of control
