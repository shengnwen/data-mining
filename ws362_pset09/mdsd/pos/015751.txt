It seems there is no end to diet and self-help books -- with most of them not being worth the paper they are printed on. Then there is Squeezing Your Size 14 Self Into A Size 6 World: A Real Woman's Guide To Food, Fitness And Self-Acceptance by Carrie Myers Smith who draws upon her considerable experience and undeniable expertise to create a truly effective and "user friendly" manual that will enable her readers to successfully deal with the kinds of head games and body games that so often derail simple happiness and ordinary satisfaction with our selves. Carrie delivers the keys to successful self-care; shows how to control stress and not let stress be in control; how wellness means uncluttering our lives; how to overcome obstacles to fitness; figure out a fitness plan specifically appropriate for the reader's particular needs; as well as discovering what "eating personality" is ours and how to use it to advantage. Also very highly recommended is the companion title, Carrie Myers Smith's Squeezing Your Size 14 Self Into A Size 6 World Workbook (1891400967, $18.95) complete with exercises and worksheets to create a truly customized personal wellness plan.
