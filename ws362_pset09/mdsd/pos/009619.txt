I read half of the book in the first sitting - I didn't want to put it down (but made myself go to bed). It was a great read and I found the first person perspective of the three protagonists a nice twist.  Their budding then enduring friendships were a breath of fresh air, especially considering their antitheses (mother-in-law, step daughters, etc.).  I was surprised at the restraint used by both Stella and Erin.  Personally I would have verbally roasted these adversarial characters.  I was delighted with the role the dog played throughout the book (and that it ended happily with Cash finding his little girl; so many of these stories never end well, as we in animal rescue know).  This book was a wonderful weekend escape.
