Very useful aromatherapy guide.  It is intensely scientific...particularly the 2nd chapter entitled "Essential Oils - Definition and Distillation"; bored me out of my mind. It has a wonderful chapter on self-treatment and all the precautions with a guide of all the essential oils and their uses.  I am glad I bought it, however I am sure there are better guides out there.
