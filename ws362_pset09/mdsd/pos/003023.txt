This is one of the most important books of 'eco-feminism'  in existence (although I would rather call it truth than feminism).  This book inspired me to be courageous with my own thoughts and to enact a spoken word piece that I had been sitting on for weeks. Thank you Susan Griffin for exposing the truths of the oppression of women.  I will be reading this book again and again.
