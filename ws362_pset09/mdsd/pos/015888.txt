Goldratt and Deming, are arguably two of the most influential business  thinkers ever. This book melds statistical process control, and the Theory  of Constraints, finally bringing these techniques together in one book.  You'll gain a basic understanding of both SPC, and an intro to the Theory  of Constraints (TOC), and Goldratts' Thinking Processes (TP). In addition  to presenting the tools for process control, measurement, and continuous  improvement, the book provides brief bios of both Deming and Goldratt,  giving the reader insight into the background of both. Very good book, and  a great compliment to other TOC material
