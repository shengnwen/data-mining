I love Jeffery Deaver. He has a great way of telling a story and making you feel as if you are there with the characters every step of the way. This one had be gussing until the end (and even then I found out my guessing was wrong). Great book and hard to put down. I also like the way that he explains things in his books. I don't know the first thing about hackers or the web for that matter, but was able to follow the plot with no problems.
