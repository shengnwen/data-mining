  King George is considered to be one of the greatest opponents of the American Revolution.  But does anyone ever really hear of his good traits until now.  And in a childrens book!  Well I know I didn't.  And after reading this short story I found that ole George wasn't such a bad guy after all.  All he wanted was for Brittain to become, well...richer.  Couldn't those colonists help pay for some of his debts.  Well maybe, if those colonists actually had any SAY in British matters then they should have to pay taxes.  Well I still think he wasn't a BAD guy,  he just tried to take the easiest way out.

  Tomie DePaola and Jean Fritz-I think-make the perfect team.  His comical illustrations with her undefinable text make this book a classic. 

  Fritz or Freedman '04.  You decide.
