Amazon has not done a good job sorting out the various editions and translations of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.  As a result, comments with many stars actually may be referring to an entirely different translation.  Likewise, hardbound references don't match up with the paperback versions.  I'd recommend that you find a copy somewhere and look at the text yourself before you order.
