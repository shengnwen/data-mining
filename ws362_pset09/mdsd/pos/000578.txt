The recipies in this book are very easy, accessible, healthy and most of all....delicious! The soups in particular are flavorful and satisfying and do not require a lot of clean-up afterwards. Just cook it all in the same pot and you are ready to go. The pasta recipies are also very tasty. It's a great way to get your veggies without feeling hungry at the end of the meal. I highly recommend this book
