There is a ton of great information in this book.  I wish the author would update with a newer version, however.  There are also a ton of typos and grammatical mistakes which should be edited (for credibility's sake if nothing else).  This is a very handy reference and anyone in the process of adopting from Russia or Ukraine should read it
