I loved The Girls Hunting Guide...and I was not disappointed by her second book. I am currently in law school and am always looking for something that I can read on the side that is NOT LAW-RELATED. I tried a few and this is a great, fun read.

I don't laugh at comedians...just not the laugh-out-loud thing for me..I know, weird. I am huge laugher, however, but I have never laughed SO hard while reading a book as I do during this.  I keep stopping and sharing cute quotes with my boyfriend. 

You grow to enjoy the main character so much that you are strangely identifying and sympathizing with her. These coming of age stories are great if written correctly and Banks wastes no time showing us this woman's life; it's funny, efficient, and entertaining
