Evan Thomas writes like who he is: a good reporter who realizes that what he's writing is history. He adds little sentimentality because he doesn't have to. He has framed his subject in an interesting way (Bobby's alienated childhood left him with empathy for underdogs and outsiders, as well as an outsized loyalty to the family's whose acceptance he craved) that just giving us the facts, just telling us the story, packs an emotional punch.

Knowing how this story ends makes everything about it more powerful. Again, Thomas isn't maudlin because he doesn't have to be. When the Kennedy Brothers are dealing with Dr. King, all three of them making compromises because they are confident that they have time to accomplish their individual agendas, you shake your head because of what was lost. As Bobby moves to the head of the family, finally getting the respect he craved his whole life, you are overwhelmed with sadness and dread.

Most of all, as you watch RFK change, learn and grow as a man and a politician and statesman, you ache for what we lost as a country. Today it seems that being completely intractable is viewed as a positive thing in our leaders. Bobby proved we have the capacity to evolve, to take our experiences and better ourselves. Imagine what a President like that could have accomplished
