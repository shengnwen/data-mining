While this is a wonderful cookbook with authentic and distinctive Italian recipes--especially seafood recipes like Calms Posillipo (Frank Sinatra's favorite), Chilean Sea Bass with Eggplant and Olives (Tony Bennett's favorite)and some wonderful shrimp dishes--what makes it really distinctive is that Patsy's has been around since the 1940s and it is filled with stories and comments by many of the celebrities who eat there regularly.  It was famously Frank Sinatra's favorite place and he brought lots of his friends there for authentic Italian dinners.  You won't find many of these recipes in the standard Italian cookbooks.  They're unique to Patsy's and wonderful to make
