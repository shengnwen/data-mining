Welcome to Shutter Island, Dennis Lehane's high octane thriller roller coaster where nothing is was it seems.  Who can you trust?  What can you trust?  Where are the clues leading?  These are the questions that, like a TV like Lost, gives you one answer and then leads you to ask 3 more.  Dennis Lehane gives us a great protagonist in Teddy Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule.  They are led to Shutter Island to investigate the escape of a female mental institution patient named Rachel.  Lehane tops it off with a wonderful backstory of Teddy's dead, murdered wife and haunting flashbacks (his wife was killed by a current patient that Teddy is searching for).  What ensues is conspiracy theories about what is REALLY going on the island.  And the most haunting question...what lies inside the lighthouse?  Lehane gives great dialogue between the characters and plenty of humor without interrupting the suspense.  As you race through the pages, you will ask, "Can Teddy escape the island?"  If he can break the codes and his own fears, he has a shot.  My only problem with this novel was excessive swearing, which seems typical in Lehane novels.  Other than, though, this was the best book I have read this year
