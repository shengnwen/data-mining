I'm a big time dragon lover. I have so many pictures, and statues that I don't even know what to do with! (along with other dragon stuff! :-D) I just got the Dragon tarot today, and I felt connected to it, before I even looked at the cards! I just felt an energy rush, run through my body. It was incredible and unbelievable! The feeling was so strong. I also have the Celtic Dragon tarot deck, and I just love them both. I recommend this deck, especially if you love dragons
