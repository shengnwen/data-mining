Daniel Pipes reviewed this book on ' FrontPageCom.' He praised its scholarship highly. He claims that Cook in tracing the development of the concept of Jihad says that aside from a Sufi interpretation of the concept relating it to personal spiritual development ,it has  meant in most stages of Islamic history waging total war against one's enemy.
The most alarming element in his review is the fact that the present - day interpretation of Jihad is the most extreme that there has been historically. And the hostility displayed to the non- Muslim world by those who hold this concept is absolute. Thus those who try to sugarcoat the concept ignore the danger inherent in those who espouse it
