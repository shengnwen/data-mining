I bought my yellow covered copy of 'Fields of Fire', with the photo of a US Marine helping a wounded buddy super-imposed on the front cover, in 1979.

I must say the picture on my copy of this book is more relevant than the current cover picture (see above) ie how often did US Marines ride into combat in choppers anywhere in Vietnam? 

As far as I know they (99% of the time) walked and / or were trucked / shipped everywhere - & I don't recall any reference to the books characters 'flying' - but I am happy to stand corrected here. It would not be the first time "Publishers" have 'ignored' reality when creating the front cover.

However, having said all that this book remains today the book I measure all Vietnam war novels (fiction & non-fiction) against. It is like many others of its genre ie the story of a group of men (boys really) trying to survive their 'tour of duty' in and around the chaos of their reality. 

Its the 'feel' of the environmant as outlined in the book in & out of combat (as written by combat veteran James Webb), that remains so very real.

It measures up the equal of 'The 13th Valley' in terms of story telling and is far better than 'We Were Soldiers Once..And Young' in terms of maps.

This novel will go down as one of the overall greats of its era
