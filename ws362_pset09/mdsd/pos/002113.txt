This book is about an Englishmen Phileas Fogg who had a bet with whist partners. He did so not because he needed the money, but because he solely wanted to win. Fogg traveled with his loyal servant Passepartout. They were secretly followed by Detective Fix who thought Fogg was the bank robber since he left England with a great amount of money. Fix believed that Fogg's abrupt leaving was the pretext of avoiding to be arrested, and he trusted his stubborn belief no matter what Passepartout told him. Because of him, Fogg was on the verge of losing his wager for many times when e tried his bet to detain him on the British territories so the arrest warrant would be valid. On the journey, Fogg rescued Aouda, an Indian princess, from the savages who practiced human sacrifice and told her she would remain unscratched wherever they went. After meeting Aouda, Fogg's whole life changed. And eventually, happiness and love were the new words added to his vocabulary.

This book gets more interesting as I read along, and it is also unpredictable because you never know what is going to happen next. For people who like adventure stories, "Around the World in 80 Days" is definitely one of the best choices.
