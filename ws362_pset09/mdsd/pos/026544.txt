I lived in the Dominican Republic for two years and traveled widely throughout the country. I wish I had this book while I was there. The book is filled with a tremendous amount of background information about the  nation's history, geology, ecology and culture. I know of no other  publication that is as comprehensive. The sections of the book devoted to  specific cities and towns reflect a keen eye for each communities unique  characteristics as seen by an American who enjoys foreign cultures and  people.      The author's writing ability is first rate whether he is  describing a technical matter or expressing a personal opinion.      I  strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about  the Dominican Republic; especially for those visiting or living in the  country
