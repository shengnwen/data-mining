This book is so wonderful and helpful.  I just started working in a law firm doing litigation and I knew nothing.  This was a total foreign language to me.  The book is laid out so easy to read and is so interesting it keeps your attention.  I highly recommend this book to everybody.  Even just to keep as a reference book.  It is very helpful.  I hope one day they make a Strictly New York book
