Euell Gibbons was master forager, or at least among those that are also authors.  His book is absolutely fascinating, and he makes the reader aware of a multitude of wild plants and animals that few have ever tasted, or even been aware of for that matter.  

There are countless useful recommendations for the preparation of foraged foods, many of which would be unpalatable or even inedible without using the provided suggestions.  His stories are great and he relates many tales from his days as a forager.

The problem I have with the book is that it is first and foremost a cookbook.  It has drawings and descriptions of most, but not all, of the wild edibles he talks about.  This is hardly a good method for identifying plants.  On the back cover it even suggests you could live off the plants and animals described in the book.  This is possible, but not likely, particularly if you cannot even properly identify the plants!  And considering that there are numerous poisonous plants in any given locale, you had best not delve to deeply into the world of foraging without tagging along with an expert or at least having a detailed field guide.

Take the book for what it is - an excellent resource for preparing wild edibles and opening a whole new world for the outdoorsman.
