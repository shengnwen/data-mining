This book is so tightly bound you will fear ripping it to shreds just trying to open it. Once open, and it is a struggle, you will be awe-struck at the beautiful reproductions of the near-impossible structures designed by Eisenman. Galofaro cuts the architect's excessively thick theory, asking simply, &quot;how has digital production affected his theory based practice?&quot; As tiny as this book is, it is BIG on content and imagery. The author has not spared us his investigations - unearthing some of the architect's little known projects (many unbuilt to date). And while it is not the singular authority on the work of Peter Eisenman, it is definately an essential addition to any collection on contemporary architecture
