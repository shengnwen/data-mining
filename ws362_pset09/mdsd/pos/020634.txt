This books gives a pretty accurate dipiction of military life during war time. Each of the stories shows a different way a spouse reacted during the deployment.  The only problem I have with this book is that each story is so scattered throughout the book.  I wished that each chapter would have focused on on one story for every chapter or two. This way is a little confusing as to where each person is.  There are times the author even is switching between Vietnam War and Iraq War stories and it can be very confusing.  Overall I felt like I wasn't alone in my feelings during the deployment. And learned a few more things.  I really liked the section in the back of the book that listed where the author got a lot of her reference materials, so I can read them too.

So to the reader who states that it's our own fault if we don't search out the information - Sometimes we don't know where to go or who to contact to get that information.  During my husbands deployment, if our Marine unit hadn't had mandatory family readiness meetings for everyone I would never had known what was going on.  Thank god for the KVC because when I went to the mandatory Return and Reunion meeting for the entire unit - the Ombudsman had, had no idea there was any Navy attached to Weapons Co.  She was so surprised to see us and here they were coming back in a few weeks after being gone for a year!  Being in the Navy I got all my information thru the Marines and not all that applied to me in the NAVY.  They'd tell me to contact the Navy for more information but couldn't tell me who to talk too.  Where does that leave me?  Hanging out there in the wind.  I live in a civilian community and am the only one with a miltary deployed husband,  I lost my job because of his deployment.  This is a book that civilians should read to get a little better understanding of the military spouse situation.  Because a being a military spouse is not at all like being a single parent
