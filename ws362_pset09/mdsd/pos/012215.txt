This book provides excellent coverage of the Pueblo incident from a number of viewpoints, including a number of the captured men as well as those involved in the crisis response and negotiations.  

I found this book provides compelling testimony in the debate over "questionable methods" in the current conflict.  The brutal torture that the men of the Pueblo endured only managed to extract fantastic "confessions" and steel the men's resolve to resist their captors
