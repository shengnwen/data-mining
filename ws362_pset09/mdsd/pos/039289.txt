I purchased this book on the recommendation of a friend. I gave it to my son and daughter-in-law before the birth of their first child.  They were both thrilled with the book and, in turn, purchased it for a couple they knew were having a child.  It is a soothing and magical must read.  It is relaxing and thought provoking.  It reminds us of what is truly important in this life and the great blessing we can experience with the celebration of life.  It is one of those rare finds that you never tire of and with each re-read, you smile again and say &quot;Ah, yes&quot;. Eleanor Manning, Author, Voices
