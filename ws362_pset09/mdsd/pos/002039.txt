"Asking Questions, Getting Answers, Shifting Consciousness" is the subtitle to this book.  Those words describe my experience with the book as well.  Brandt has taken the ancient wisdom of the Vision Quest and condensed it into a practice that can be woven into our busy modern lives. Yet this book is also much more. Using stories and examples from his own experience as well as the experience of others, he shows us how we can find our authentic self and our connection with the divine.  How strong is my recommendation?  In addition to my own, I've purchased 6 additional copies to give to loved ones
