I really got into this book.  I had never read this author before but I will be picking up some of her other books.  I would like to try her Sherlock Holmes series also.  I'm not going to write a plot summary since so many others on Amazon have already written one.  I really enjoyed the exploration of the characters in this book.  Kate, the main character, grows and you find out so much about her.  You feel her struggles, triumphs and sadness in this book.  I also enjoyed her partner and watching how he handles the stress of a case.  This book kept me on my toes until the end.  I didn't know who the murderer was and Ms. King keeps the twists coming.  I'm looking forward to buying the next in the series to see what has been happening to the characters.  I would highly recommend this series so far to anyone looking for a good mystery
