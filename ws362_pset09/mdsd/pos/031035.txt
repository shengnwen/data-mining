Robert McCloskey, author of the classic "Make Way for Ducklings" is one of the greatest American children's authors. Blueberries for Sal is a great introduction to this author for the younger listener who might not have the patience or understanding for "Ducklings" or "One Morning in Maine," another beautiful McCloskey book. My two-and-a-half year old just adores this story and could hear it over and over. Here, little Sal (who is much older in "Maine") goes with her mother to pick blueberries to can for the winter and finds herself all mixed with a bear mother and child who have come to gorge themselves on blueberries. Sal's and Little Bear's frustration at being expected to keep up with their busy mothers rings true with toddlers and they adore the hilarious mother-child mix-up that ensues. Every child should read this one, if only so that children learn that people used to can their own food!
