       Someone Like You by Sarah Dessen is 281 pages long and published by The Penguin Group in 1998. This is a realistic fiction novel told through the eyes of Halley, the main character, as she travels through the hardships in her junior year of high school. Other characters that play an important role in the storey are Scarlet, her best friend, Macon, her boyfriend, and her parents.
	In Someone Like You Halley is trying to find herself and break free of the hold her mother has on her life along with trying to stay strong for Scarlet who seems to be having even bigger problems. Scarlet finds out she's pregnant with the child of her boyfriend who died in a motorcycle accident. Halley meets Macon who pressures her to do things she doesn't feel comfortable doing and leads her down some bad paths, separating her even more from her parents.
	I absolutely love this book. It had a lot of life lessons on love, friends, and family. I liked how realistic the story, the people, and the pressures they face are, and how it can be related to any teenagers' life. The writing is very descriptive and Sarah Dessen does a great job giving detail to the characters so it's like you really know them and feel what they're feeling.
	I could hardly put the book down at night. I recommend this book to everyone who likes Realistic Fiction even just a little bit.
