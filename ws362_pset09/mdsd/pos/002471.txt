I found this book to be a great read. The writing was quite eloquent and absorbing and I found that I got to know honey bees intimately. Because the structure of the book, the sense you get of the history of the honey bee is somewhat fragmented. I agree with some of the other reviewers that there is something lacking to the science side, although very well researched and very nearly comprehensive, I didn't feel like the social and environmental issues facing this amazing creature were sufficiently addressed. I was dissappointed that the issue of genetically engineered food and organisms was glossed over, this however may be because the book is largely set in the USA which is one of the few countries worldwide where the implications and effects of GMO's for humans and animals are also largely glossed over. I felt that Hattie Ellis in her wonderful history: "Sweetness and Light: The Mysterious History of the Honey Bee" did a remarkable job at addressing the various issues of the plight of the modern honey bee, and like Holley Bishop's book is a very compelling read
