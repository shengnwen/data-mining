The author has done a wonderful job of researching the years of the dust bowl. I found this book to be excellent although depressing, if that makes sense.  I am in awe that anyone stayed on the prairies and survived at all. Eating pickled tumble weed to your family because nothing else would grow.
May we all learn to respect the land and never let this happen again
