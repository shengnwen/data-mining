This book is long, complicated, lots of flashbacks, historical references, and thoroughly engrossing.  When I first started it I read a few pages and decided I didn't like it.  I put the book aside for a day or two, then went I picked it up again, I became so interested in the story I could hardly put it down. This is the second book I have read by William Martin, and I must say, he can sure tell a good story.  I glad I gave the book a second chance.  Well worth it.
