As the President and CEO of FranchiseInterviews.com, I have read many books relating to entrepreneurship.  I think the authors did a fantastic job at writing this book.  They use many examples and cases to help you easily understand the topics.  

I highly recommend this book for aspiring entrepreneurs as well as schools that offer a program in entrepreneurship
