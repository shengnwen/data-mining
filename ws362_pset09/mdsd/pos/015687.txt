Was introduced to this book in 1964, and have had the book near my desk at home since that time. Manly Hall was a unique individual and his encyclopedic compilation of information in one volume is masterful. Recently purchased the paper back edition to allow notes to be placed in the margins. My original shall remain unmarked. Purchased copies for two of my students also, this precludes the refusal of their request to borrow my original. The paper backed edition has the marvelous art work of the original, and frankly the prints look even better than the first copy purchased.
Try it you will like it!
