This book is full of information about the history of soda and root beer. It is also full of fun recipes that are easy to make. There are resources with places you can buy any ingredients you can't easily find. The pictures only add to the text and are very pretty. 

It is well worth the money if you enjoy doing fun things with your family or like experimenting in the kitchen. 
Enjoy.
