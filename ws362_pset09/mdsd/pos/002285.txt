I'm not one for writing long reviews, but to sum up this book in a few short sentences is impossible. So I will tell you the most profound messages in this book for me, just to keep the review simple.

Don't be ashamed of, or apologize for who you are.
Be the best that you can be.

Although I found the ideas in this book to be thought provoking, with the fiction giving a good illustration of the underpinning philosophy of objectivism, I do have one criticsm. The story becomes a little extreme in its conclusions.

A good read none the less.
