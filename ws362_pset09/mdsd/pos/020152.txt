This classic book provides a well presented introduction to RF circuit design, focused on  giving the reader a thorough grounding in the basic concepts needed to become a professional RF circuit designer.  There is  sufficient mathematical rigor to convince the pros, but not so much as to  make the book inaccessable to students and more advanced amateurs.  The  author is an experienced state of the art RF designer and a life long  &quot;RF guy&quot;--I've been reading his articles in QST magazine for 25  years.  This experience and his devotion to the field come through strongly  in his book.  Though first published in the early 1980's, most of the  material is basically timeless.  I do hope Wes will someday revise it to  include newer RF IC design as well.  The book deserves to be in the library  of every professional, and especially those just starting in the field
