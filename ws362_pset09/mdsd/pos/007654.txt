Like other reviewers here, I saw the movie first and was then prompted to read the original book. But I wanted to read the book because I felt like the movie had a good backbone it just really lacked in presentation and character development. After reading the book I can see why. The movie is an extremely loose adaptation.

The novel starts off in present day with a Borden descendant discovering his heritage for the first time in a memoir about the magician Alfred Borden. From here we go on to actually read the Borden memoir. There is a brief interlude of present-day story, and then we go on to read another memoir, this one by Borden's nemesis, Rupert Angier, another magician.

The way the story flows allows for multiple realizations by the reader. (And don't worry about knowing some of the secrets if you've already seen the movie, the book is different enough that nothing will be ruined. In fact it will actually be helpful because you'll see how obviously everything is laid out before you). 

What the book also accomplishes is a very well-developed exploration of the theme of duality and human nature. While the movie may have attempted to express this, none of the characters were explored enough to really give the idea gravity. In the book, as we read the intimate details of each man's journal, and discover many of their secrets and experiences, we see what obsession and resentment and bitterness can do to people.

The ending is a bit sudden and definitely not as compelling as the rest of the book, but The Prestige still packs a big punch and is one of those enjoyable reads that you just can't put down. If you're at all interested, check this book out today. You won't be sorry
