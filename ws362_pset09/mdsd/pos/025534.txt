Like most of the reviews mention, this book helps the reader to see a different side of Hirohito and the crucial events of the twentieth century in a different light. The book was a good and informative read, though it was a bit dry in a few parts. But if you can get through the few dry parts, Bix does a good job at portraying Japan's position during WWII, the influential people surrounding the Emperor, and Hirohito's refusal to accept defeat until August 1945. What is especially great about this book is its telling of the stories that few people know, specifically the events of U.S. occupation to 1952 and the struggles of Japan in the post-1952 era to the end of the Showa period. Overall this was a good biography of Hirohito, unquestionably one of the most loved and hated men of the last century.
