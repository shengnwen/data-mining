Unsung Hero was the first one of the series that i had picked up(fortunately this one was the first one of the series), And it hooked me to the whole series. I have already read most of the series. recently i picked this one up again just because i had enjoyed it so much the first time and i just had that great time once again!
Tom and Kelly's story is so HOT! Both of them are so different on the surface but Kelly is not such a nice girl as she looks and Tom is not nearly as bad a boy that whole town seems to think he is. Kelly is wild and Tom is a sensitive guy. I really loved how Kelly finally got Tom in her bed. I mean it was kind of thrilling how she completely lost her patience with Tom being 'Nice' to her for her own good because she wanted the Tom she had known when she was fifteen who was dangerous and she wanted him badly! 
But later when she treated him badly i really felt like crying for Tom. Tom pretended to be a tough guy but he was very sensitive and i kind of felt good when he made Kelly crawl for sayings those things to him.
David and Mallory's story was good too. I think in this book most of the characters were completely oppostite to what they looked like when u got to know them better. Like Tom and Kelly and then David and Mallory. David looked like a geek and a loser but he was smart and talented and Mallory looked like a bold 'devil may care' attitude girl but inside she was very vulnerable and unsure about herself. I liked this journey to get to know these characters. 
The World War II love triangle was the best story of this series i have read till now. Charles, Joe and Cybele's story was really intense and tragic. And the end was awesome. Finally Charles became the hero Cyeble fell in love with
