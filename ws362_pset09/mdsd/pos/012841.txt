I purchased this book as a companion to Sink Reflections by Marla Cilley, aka Flylady.  Marla often references the Sidetracked Home Executive as the origin for her organizing system, and I was hopeful this book would solve some the mysteries behind the terms she uses such as "SHE" and "Born Organized."  They definitely did, with quite a bit of humor and wit.  A very enjoyable book.  I probably won't use the card-file system (my control journal is already functioning quite well for this purpose), though will be able to use several of the tips in this book.  Would recommend this book for other flybabies.
