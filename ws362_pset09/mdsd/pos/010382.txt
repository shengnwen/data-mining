Some people have complained that this book wasn't in-depth enough for them...  Well, the book is a guide!  It doesn't claim to be an all-inclusive, comprehensive text.  But it is definitely a great reference tool to learn the sheer basics.  The illustrations and accompanying descriptions for learning the crochet and knit stitches are very good.  Previously, seeing a pattern for a project would have intimidated me.  Now I can understand them and have successfully created some articles that I'm very proud of.  

To get you started, I would recommend this book.  It's quite convenient to have to different styles of stitching in a single book.  I have found it to be quite handy as I continue learning to perfect my crocheting and knitting skills. 

Again, it's just a primer into these beautiful arts.  You can't expect to become an expert overnight, but you will be able to tackle easy and intermediate projects for sure.  I suppose it all depends on our individual learning styles
