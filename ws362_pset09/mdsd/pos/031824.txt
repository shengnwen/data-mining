Before they can go to their new home, Chihiro and her family end up in a strage fake-looking place.  When her parents are turned into pigs, Chihiro has to depend on the help of a strange and mysterious boy named Haku. I'd never read in the Japanese right-to-left format before, so I had a little bit of trouble at first, but it's not too bad once you get used to it.  Everything is read from right to left, not just where you start in the book, but also which speech bubble you start with and what side of the page.  I haven't seen the film yet, but, after reading this, I'm really looking forward to seeing it.  I liked Haku the most, although Chihiro got more interesting as the story progressed
