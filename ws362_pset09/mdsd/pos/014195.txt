When i first saw this book at my local Borders, i immediately picked it up. Ive been an avid fan of these guides and own every single one so far.  The first thing that struck me was the amazing pictures, even tho the obvious nod to the Iwo Jima memorial was kinda silly.  I loved the representations of the Death of the Lusankya and the inclusion of the video games i love, especially KOTOR(knights of the old republic). Unfortunately, after reading thru it I noticed more than a few errors.  Referring to Darth Revan as "him", referring to Darth Traya as well as Darth Kreia(for those who havent played KOTOR 2, theyre the same person), and most importantly making numerous references to the jedi mission to "wayland' to destroy the Voxyn, which actually took place on Myrkr.  I know I seem kinda like a nazi here, but it made me a little mad that a book that looks very well done was poorly checked for accuracy.  On the whole though, its very interesting and the pictures are great, definetaly a must buy
