I began reading this book with a negative vibe already in place due to the huge amount of reviews claiming this book was 
Difficult but rewarding
Hard but good

The list of self serving metaphors continued but I want to talk about the book.  

It is NOT a difficult read.  The prose are colorful but simple.  The story is very engaging.  The characters are nicely fleshed out and the mystery is quite rewarding.  All in all, it's a long book, that reads very fast.

Unlike what so many reviewers have stated you do not need to have a degree in philosophy or history to enjoy this novel.  The book tells a colorful vibrant story without becoming melodramatic piece of trash such as the usual DAN BROWN novel.

Which brings me to my final point.

The reviews on this website for this book are hilarious as well as a bit sickening.  It is so obvious that by pasting the book up as some kind of difficult read the BIBLIO SNOBS who review it are basically stating that they are smarter than the average reader because they got through a fictitious book.  Ridiculous.

This book is by no means Dickens or Perez.  It's not award worthy  it's just a really good, fast read.

Don't let others make your mind up for you.  Read for yourself
