The title of my review sums it up... stick a pretentious professor of philology in a series of European settings and watch the foolish action, to which our hero (Von Igelfeld) is oblivious.  The book is a set of eight stories that are somewhat intertwined, involving the professor and his unusual friends.  The best ones are the first two.  I got the biggest chuckle when the 1923 edition of the rules of tennis had no provision for a tie breaker, which led the professors into total confusion.  Some of the later chapters could have used a bit more humor.  Throughout the book, Von Igelfeld's pride in his great book of Portuguese irregular verbs is evident.
