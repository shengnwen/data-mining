If anyone read How To Make Money In Stocks once or twice and made a  consistent profit over the last three years, my hat is off to them!

To make money while using this book requires study, testing, study, testing and a healthy portion of experience.  There is a wealth of good information contained in the book, but one will realize consistent profits with it much more readily in an up market rather than a down or sideways market.

One excellent caution included in the book is the warning against using options until one has gained (a few years of) experience with the underlying stocks.

In my opinion, "paper trading" stocks for several months to a year or more using O'Neil's system would be a really good idea prior to trying to trade stocks immediately after reading this book.  And as I said, one will consistently make money using the book much more readily in an up market.

Otherwise, it's an enjoyable read, with many interesting ideas derived from years of experience and possibly the greatest stock database ever assembled
