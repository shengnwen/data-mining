Though the book is detailed and fairly comprehensive, the poor editing mars the quality of the book. Even the acknowledgement page contains 4 typos. That is a certain embarrassment. It is difficult to overcome the initial impression of sloppy editing and the book seems to have been rushed to meet some deadlines.

If you can get past the editorial issues, the book is a good collection of almost any interesting technical indicator that is available.  While this book cannot be a substitute for the classic book by Murphy on technical investing, it is still a good resource for any investor. Of specific interest to the reader who is already aware of the technical investing (and a Murphy fan), the sections on "psychological strategies" is an interesting read. Other than that the book presents information from a huge variety of sources that has anything to do with indicators and oscillators.  If you want to invest in only 1 book on technical investing, the book by Murphy is a better bet, with its better organization, editing and use of examples. This book, however, is a welcome addition, and not necessarily a must-have
