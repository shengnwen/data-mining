Donald Harmon Akenson's 2000 book Saint Saul is difficult to read, but the rewards are many for the dutiful student. Akenson hopes to see what historical evidence can be found for the life of Jesus by examining the epistles of Saul (aka Paul). To do this, he begins by examining the religious dynamics in the First Century to try to give us some idea of the world in which Yeshua and Saul lived. BTW, Akenson insists on using words such as Yeshua, Saul, and YHWH instead of the traditional Jesus, Paul, and God. His rationale is that only by using the words that they used can we try to put ourselves into their world (It's a good point and I found it useful.).

Akenson gives us an excellent background into the religious situation. He documents the plethora of Jewish sects, an issue rarely discussed by other scholars. He also provides the OT references to concepts such as Messiah, Son of God, Son of Man, etc. and shows that it took a great leap of faith, diligent searching, and some dishonest juggling for the early Christians to find any precursors to Jesus in these OT concepts.

The book is not without its problems. For example...

- Akenson claims that Jesus' followers were Nazarenes because Jesus came from Nazareth (p. 63). In fact, the Nazarene sect existed long before Jesus, and it is a mis-translation of Nazarene which leads gospel writers to even think that Jesus came from Nazareth, which at that time was a stop over for camel jockeys and cave dwellers and didn't contain a synagogue as described in the gospels.
 
- Akenson equates Josephus scholarship with Winston Churchill and claims "his standard of accuracy is higher than Churchill's (p. 270)" suggesting that Akenson's own Irish background has influenced his scholarship. Josephus lived on a Roman pension and was a traitor to his Jewish followers. Every word of every book was carefully selected to keep his Roman paymasters happy, lest they give to him the same fate they gave to the men he betrayed. 

 - Akenson believes that the later addition of material about Jesus to Josephus' Antiquities (20:200) are original. Few scholars would agree. 

 - Akenson believes that John the Baptist and Jesus were "cousins" (p. 80), which comes only from a fleeting reference in Luke (1:41), is actually contra-indicated later in Luke, and attested to in no other canonical sources. In his defense, he admits that his conclusion "is peripheral", and he correctly concludes that Jesus became a disciple of John. 

There are also several ad hominen attacks in the book which are unwarranted in scholarly publications. For example...

- "Although I could extend the list of those who inhale the narcotic fumes of Secret Mark to include probably two-thirds of the North American-based Jesus-questors... (p. 89)." Is Akenson  revealing his own insecurities of teaching in Canada and the UK to take a slur at North American Jesus-questors. Are there not Jesus-questors (itself a derogatory word) elsewhere? 

- "...he could only have enjoyed watching the most powerful figures in the liberal wing of the Quest establishment - Harvard... (p. 89). Earlier, Akenson makes a crack about Harvard University Press (p. 85), and one has to wonder if his own position as an editor for McGill-Queen's University Press (Who???) somehow motivates his attack here.
 
The biggest problem with this book is that one has to endure 175 of the 255 pages filled with words like "rebarbarative", "caesurae", "spumescent", etc. in order to finally reach Akenson's first comments about what Saint Saul had to say about the historical Jesus. More than half of the preceding 175 pages has been filled with comments left over from Akenson's previous book (Surpassing wonder: The invention of the Bible and the Talmuds). Many authors do this, and it always is a source of annoyance.

These errors and problems are glaring, but not significant in the larger picture that Akenson paints. Yet one can only wish that Akenson had condensed his 255 pages into the 100 good pages contained therein, and saved a dutiful reader many hours of laborious study in order to mine his nuggets of wisdom.
