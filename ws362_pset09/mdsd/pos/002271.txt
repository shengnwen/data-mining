What make's Zraly's book so good is that he cuts to the chase.  The relevant information one needs to appreciate the quintessence of a wine are gotten to very quickly.  

The vast majority of people-especially those attempting to immerse themselves into the world of wine for the 1st time-do not need superfluous information that will confuse them.  The success of Zraly's course is built on that premise.

The course is full of interesting and relevant sidebars to be sure, but as it is patterned after a textbook that information literally is positioned in sidebars.

If you are a wine lover, beginning or seasoned, you will appreciate this book.  I sell wine, and thus need a working knowledge of the world of wine and I've found this book invaluable.  

Buying this book is a no-brainer.
