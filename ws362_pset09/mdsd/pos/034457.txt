Skowronek has written a magesterial study of the American presidency, fundamentally reinterpreting it through a novel historical framework.  His writing style is very dense, and often unclear - but the hard work necessary to understand him is well worth the effort.

I first read this as an undergraduate, then twice again in graduate school.  Each reading brought out new insights I missed the previous time.

No student of the presidency can afford not to read this.  Quibble with him on some details, perhaps, but overall no one can doubt its lasting importance.  An instant classic
