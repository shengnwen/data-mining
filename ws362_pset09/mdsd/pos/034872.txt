This book is full of insight as the Medjugorje visionaries candidly discuss their encounters over the past 25 years with the Blessed Mother, who they describe as the loving Mother of every person on earth, who prays for each of us to come to know and accept God's love, regardless of whether we accept her as a gift of not, regardless of our religion, race, or nationality. A truly inspiring and beautiful book!

You will not be sorry you read this book!
