  George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) was a great English novelist of
the Victorian period. Her list of classics is impressive:
"Scenes from Clerical Life'; "Adam Bede"; "The Mill on the Floss"
Middlemarch" and "Daniel Deronda" are among the greatest novels
ever written in the English Language.
  Felix Holt tells the story of a radical candidate for Parliament. He has become a watchmaker; cares for his mother
and courts Esther Lyon the sophisticated daughter of a poor
minister. Esther is also courted by Harold Transome who like
Holt is also a Radical candidate for Parliament. Harold is rich, 35, a widower with a young son. Holt is young, fiery and idealistic. 
  The most interesting character in the novel is Mrs. Transome who has secrets to keep. She is well drawn by Eliot.
   In addition to the love story is the tale of an inheritance.
This tangled delve into old documents is complex and may lose
some readers.
   The tale climaxes with a working man's revolt and other suprises for the interested reader. The book is not as long as
some of her novels but does hold one's interest.
   This is not Eliot's best novel but it is worth reading.
