The Vampire Lestat is probably the best book after Interview with the vampire. Like the previous book "Interview with the vampire" Anne Rice has sucessfully been creative in The Vampire Lestat. Lestat has become a rockstar, sold 4 million albums, and owns a band. He strives for fame and wanted to freely express his vampiric nature. Like most vampires He longs to reveal his nature and his story by writing an autobiography. In his life you'll find many things you didn't know before he met Louis from the previous book. You'll have a different view of him than how he is being percieved by Louis. He'll meet a famous vampire, before he met Louis, Armand. He'll also meet a mysterious vampire who turns out to be 2000 years old. You'll finally discover how Lestat became a vampire and how he lived as a vampire. However for those who read Interview with the vampire, Lestat doesn't talk much about the book and sometimes can seem to be an unreliable narator such as when he said he loved Claudia. However the book is well connected, every events are connected to another and it is also well connected to the book Interview with the vampire. The plot is always different, and never solid, but remember it's reading a life of another being so don't expect there to be a solid plot (for life can change it's course constantly). For those who firmly dislike a story with a weak-plot I don't reccomend you to read this book but you can try if you wish to. As for me I don't mind reading a story with a weak plot when it comes to knowing a life of another being personally
