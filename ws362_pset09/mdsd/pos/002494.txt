Really funny...Pynchon's inimitible style...it's no Gravity's Rainbow but hell, what is? 
Vineland : GR :: Sailor's Song : Sometimes a Great Notion
and all 4 are top 5% fiction in my book.
By the way (in response to an earlier review), people who know Humboldt County know how to spell it...
And John Irving "more substantial" than Pynchon????
Please
