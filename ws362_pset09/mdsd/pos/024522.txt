Kevin's writing draws you into his journey - a remarkable romp around Ireland with a donkey that seems human.  I loved it.  You could nearly smell the air and see the characters.  A magical look at an island that has changed so much in the 25 years since his journey took place.  I wanted to be there by his side as he runs into character after character.  His book is the next best thing to being there.

I didn't want his journey to end.  Alas, time moves on and progress can't be stopped.  If only there could be a sequel.

Anyway, it is written in very short, easy to read chapters.  Perfect nighttime reading.  If you like adventures, humor, self reflection, and interesting characters - read this book.  If you have ever been to Ireland and fallen in love with it, this book is a must read.  If you live in Ireland now and want a look back at the country as it existed 25 years ago, this book is required reading
