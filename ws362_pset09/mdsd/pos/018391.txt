This was my first foray into the world of John le Carre.  I thought the book was rather enjoyable.  There were some ineresting themes, other than the rather overt anger expressed over the current state of affairs with America and Great Britain's current Middle East policies.

Clearly le Carre is a novelist of great ability, and the book was very readable.  I would caution anyone looking for the sheer excitement of a Ludlum spy novel, or even a Vince Flynn novel, to temper their expectations.  The suspense in this book is not based on a great deal of "shoot em up" action.  This is a quieter novel of introspection, focusing on two spies at the end of their careers.  This book was about friendship, loyalty, and ideals.  

A fine Read that lies in the 3.5 to 4.0 stars realm
