This book takes place generations before the classic Liaden stories.  The characters in this book were legendary figures in the later novels, and finally writing their story must have been a daunting challenge. I always felt the Liaden books were easy to enjoy, particularly if you were in the right frame of mind and inclined towards the "space opera" end of the SF genre.  The key was to be less critical of the polish applied to the prose and more appreciative of the story behind it. There was something about the universe, characters, plots, and the handling of specific scenes that made it easy to overlook the slightly amateurish writing.  The writing was invariably clear, and the stories were very enjoyable!  I'm thrilled to say the writers have developed their talents beyond any hope I might have had.  I think, however, that in chosing so great a scope, complexity, and emotional impact for the story of the legendary Liaden forerunners that they may have overreached their talents ever so slightly. That is a very subtle charge to make, and I might well be wrong.  But I'm glad they dreamt boldly in creating the backstory for such a well loved series.  I'm even more thankful that they are continuing to write! But most gratifying of all is that their talents continued to grow.  Their writing has always been very enjoyable.  I think it is also becoming impressively skilled, with no loss of the charm that captured so many hearts and minds. For me, reading (and re-reading!) the earlier books was always something of a guilty pleasure. This book is more mature and well crafted, yet just as enjoyable as the other books in the series.  Buy it, read it, enjoy it, and re-read it; you'll be in good company.  I would suggest reading the books in order of publication, rather than reading the stories in chronological order
