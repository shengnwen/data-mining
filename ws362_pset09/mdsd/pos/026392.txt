I did the same as one other man and went out and bought every other book by Charles Martin after reading this one!  I had never heard of him or his books before and my library had a 5 week exerpt of the book, that's why I got it in the first place!  Very excellent author!  I'm starting on another of his now and it's wonderful so far.  I tend to like women authors more than men because women put more details in but this guy is right on and makes you love the characters.  I'd like to hear more of this story!!
