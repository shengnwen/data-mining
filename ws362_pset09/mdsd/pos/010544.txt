The purposes of Dietrich's book should be kept in mind.  The book is not a detailed scholarly book and does not pretend to be.  It is, however, a fair-minded and useful introduction to the PRC's history for students at  the beginning undergraduate level.  Students and China buffs must begin  somewhere, after all, and Dietrich's book is as good as any (and much  better than many) for this purpose.  I have happily used the book for  introductory classes I have taught in major U.S. and Canadian universities
