Ayn Rand is perhaps one of the most important writers of our time, both in terms of her philosophy and literary style.  Unlike her other works of fiction, 'Anthem' is quite concise and its message is crudely blunt.  The text is written in a simple format, reminiscent of Biblical parables, which was, perhaps, Rand's intention.  (Even the text's font of the Centennial Edition gives a crude and primitive impression.)  The plot is simple, and the book itself is unconventional in the sense that there can be said that 'Anthem' has no real climax, but rather, the main character goes through an epiphany.  Set in a Dark Ages of the future in which all traces of individuality are outlawed, one man, Equality 7-2521, dares to defy this spirit-crushing world and set the standard for a new age of individuality.

'Anthem' is not simply about the horror that is socialism, but also the struggle against the 'herd mentality'.  Equality 7-2521 chooses to live his life solely for his own happiness.  In the world today, we may not be threatened by the onslaught of socialism anymore (which is still debatable), but we are constantly bombarded by our commercialistic society, which tells us that we do not own certain (new) things we will never be part of the 'pack', so to speak.  This leaves us in a predicament where we will never be able to ever fully feel as part of the pack because as soon as we do (or, more accurately, purchase) something that gives us that feeling of belonging, something else is comes out that just questions our very status once again.  'Anthem' is a warning to all of us not to fall into that 'herd mentality'.  Let's remember that one sacred word: EGO..
