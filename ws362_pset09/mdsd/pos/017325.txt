Like everyone else, I heard about trolls when I was kid, but I started to really appreciate them when my wife and I lived in Norway.  Trolls fascinate me, not least because they're creatures of earth, almost literally-in many depictions their bodies appear to be made out of rock and clumps of sod, and they often have moss or wild grasses growing on them.  (Besides, we all know what happens when they're struck by the rays of the sun!).  I also love trolls because they seem to be descendants of the great Frost Giants and other enemies of the Norse gods like Odin and Thor.  And I like to think that, though dim-witted, trolls aren't necessarily as evil as they've been portrayed.  In a similar way, I knew even as a kid that new babies often cry at night-but I couldn't "appreciate" this fact till my own children arrived and, coyote-like, seemed to live to howl at the moon!  This can be a very, very hard time to get through, and just thinking that trolls have to face it too made me feel more compassionate toward them.  And yet the truth is that new babies-like all profound gifts from God-come with complications and challenges, which it's our loving duty to face up to.  So you kids with screaming siblings, and you oh-so-dreary-eyed, sleep-deprived mothers and fathers-take heart!  It won't last forever!  And remember:  Don't worry about witches out in the wood-for the truth is that EVERY baby is good
