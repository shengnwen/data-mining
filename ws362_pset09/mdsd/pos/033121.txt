When I first read this book I thought it to be revolutionary, ahead of it's time (as others have) and insightful.  Despite the fact that Checkland has in large moved away from the ideas and the model of this book - to me it represents the original vision of SSM (soft systems methodology) more so than his later books.  Checkland presents a history of systems thinking in the book then goes onto to discuss the need for a new approach - that of SSM.  With extreme elegance of style Checkland delivers a long and stinging critique to Hard Systems thinking and presents a coherent and thoughtful argument for his own version SSM.  Further he creates a platform for real world problem solving that is useful and interesting.  A lot of his ideas have appeared in American texts (like the fifth discipline for example) and rarely are they credited or made use of in that regard.   This book is a good place to start exploring the real world of problems with but I would highly recommended that before you go to his two other books you start here.  This in my opinion has not been bettered in any systems context to date and I am not sure it ever will or could be.   Having said that you really do need to read it and find out for yourself.  Be warned it's not for those who want to be challenged in their thinking - especially those of you who don't like the qualitative stuff.
