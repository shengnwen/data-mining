I saw this reviewed in the paper and bought it mainly because I enjoy local history.  Upon reading it I was very impressed with Bell's work.  He creates a nice balance between the events and his pursuit of the facts behind the events.  He gives informative  backgrounds on everything from the rural RI communities to TB.  The book also acts as a Folklore 101 course.  A very enjoyable read
