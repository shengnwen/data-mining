John Schulian captures the nostalgia that is unique to the game of baseball and its fandom.  The characters in this collection of short essays are memorable, and in fact this book is really more about the people of baseball than the game itself.  Schulian's style is languid and reflective--he does not capture the tension or thrills of the game on the field, nor does he try to.  Instead, the focus of these essays is on the grip that baseball has on its players, front office people (check out the touching profile on my faviorite owner Bill Veeck), and fans.  Minor league ball gets its due here, but there is also some coverage of the majors and even a nice closing essay on the place of high school ball in a blue-collar mining town.  "Twilight" is not so much a critique of today's game and its excesses, as it is a warm appreciation of its "disappearing heart."  Reading this book was kind of like Spring Training for me; a great way to get warmed up for the coming season
