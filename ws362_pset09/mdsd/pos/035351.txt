This  definitive volume was among the first to explain left brain right brain functions.  Jaynes was considered a maverick at the time in 1976.   I summarised the large tome to him in these words.  "It seems to me that you claim that until the age of deuteromony all living creatures were able to attune to a living voice within. That is before man made laws
replaced that inner authority."  It was interesting to discover that even
thirty years later the new publication has not changed.  This is a bookend
read, along side the other book end, "The Biology of Belief" Dr Bruce Lipton.
These two books summarise that shift and reason for the shifting personal andglobal cosciousness.
