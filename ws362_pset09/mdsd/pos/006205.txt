Wow! It was a great book. Even after devouring tons of info and pictures on the web this book was a very, very enjoyable read. I highly recommend checking the web out first for a preview of Clyde, Bonnie, Buck, and Blanche's history before reading this book. So you have a better feel of the many characters. Fantastic closeup view of the era leading up to the great depression. The depression itself. I found these people very complex, multidementional, raw. The story left me feeling the full range of emotions. A very touching, tragic,  personal account of the people and the time period. I've ordered other books. To dig even deeper. My only negative comment is it's to bad the book did'nt explore further
