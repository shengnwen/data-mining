For scholarly study and analysis of the Bible, described as a "surpassing wonder" by historian Donald Harman Akenson, there are thousands of resources to which I can go. However, sometimes I desire only to read through passages in the Bible - particularly the Psalms, prophetic books and the Gospels - merely reflecting and drawing on the spiritual riches to be discovered therein. So, I don't want pronunciation marks, notes, references, red-letter text or other things to distract me. This Bible meets this need for the most part. I only wish it included the Apocrypha as well.

The type is large enough that even my over-used eyes read over the text with minimal strain. The lack of "helpful" diacritics and the other items described above make reading this Bible a pleasure to hold and read. Like all Cambridge Bibles, this too is well made and beautiful to behold. And, last but not least, the price is right
