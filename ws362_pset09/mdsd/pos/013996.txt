This was a great guide for us while driving in Switzerland.  Frommer's recommendations and descriptions for places to stay and site-see were fairly accurate.  When they list a five star hotel as such, believe it.  They also included mini walking tours in various cities  ...  it was great!!!  What a fantastic way to get aquainted with unknown spots!!!
