This is the most important self-publishing book you will ever read.  Mr. Poynter has hit a grand-slam with this 15th edition of his classic book.  The book provides valuable insight on many topics to include: writing your book, formatting your book, publishing your book, marketing your book and distribution.  This book can potentially save you thousands of dollars and hours of time.  I highly recommend it.
