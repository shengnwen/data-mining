This book tells the story of Christine, a woman that has suffered a broken heart and is searching for God's will for her life. Christine has choices to make and she seeks God's will as she makes those choices. There was information in this book that Ms. Oke weaves into the story about finding God's will that I found helpful for my own life. I enjoyed the story and it had a surprise ending....very different than I was expecting
