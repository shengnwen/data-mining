Ralph Nader has intelligence, convictions, heart, and character.  More of what I can say of Bush and Gore, not sending any sublinibabalbal messages of course. It would sure be nice to see a modern American political have the guts and courage Nader  has to STAND UP TO SPECIAL INTERESTS! What a concept! In his book, Nader brilliantly writes about corporate greed and welfare and who suffers??? We do!  The working man, the people. Wonder why only 49% of the American people vote? Leaving mostly the poor and lower classes left behind? Could it be that the Republicans and Democrats don't respond to their issues? These book is useful for those of us that love our nation but don't want to see it become the corporate welfare state it is oh so quickly becoming.  An excellent read
