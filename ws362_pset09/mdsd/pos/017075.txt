I loved this book, which is the first of the Tamir Trilogy. It is about the secret destiny of a little boy who must grow up at a young age. Tobin never had the innocent childhood most nobles have. Ever since he can remember, nothing has ever been truly happy in his family. This is because of what happened the day Tobin was born. From the beginning of the book, we know that HE is actually a GIRL. Tobin's twin brother was killed so that Tobin would live to fulfill an old prophecy. The price to begin to meet this prophecy however is more than you can imagine. It doesn't just affect Tobin, but other people and wizards, alike.

To complicate matters, Tobin's twin comes back as a demon. As the book progresses, Tobin takes on a greater amount of grief anyone can bare, and especially not as a child. But through the support of his family and new friends, Tobin can take on anything. It ranges from the awful demon to the overwhelming changes in his life. 

The characters were well written, believable, and adorable. There are no such characters that are all good or evil. Most of them are driven by their ambition, greed, honor, and/or dreams. I really felt for them, especially when something happened that changed how they see the world. There are many sad parts, but are balanced by happy and interesting surprises. It made me hang on to every word. I completely recommend this book to anyone who wants a vivid book with suspenseful twists around every corner.
