Sadly it was not the war to end all.  a loss of 5000 men a day, 10 million total. We call ourselves civilized?  We have tried to annihilate ourselves several times but we can't beat that record. The novel is written in the form of "Winds of War" with many factual men and happenings in a fiction background.  This is the first novel i have read on WW1 and really enjoyed it.  The research must have been phenomenal.  I will surely read more of Mr. Shaara's novels.  They cannot be better than this one. that is my opinion
