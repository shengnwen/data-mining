I found this book to help me to clarify the concepts learned in my biology textbook.  Cell biology, Evolution, Origin of Life and Animal Physiology were explained with simple language.  It was actually more enjoyable to read then my textbook.  What I really found outstanding was the following which I got on amazon-- 
The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations (Volume 1 isbn;1933023007, Volume 2 isbn; 1933023015, Volume 3 isbn; 1933023023)
These 3 study guides had similar questions to my college biology exams.  Well worth the investment because it made my studying much more effective
