Great for pre-schoolers to learn about giving and introduce them to Chinese New Year Celebration. Read the book to 3 year olds at a pre-school. Everyone was very attentive.  Kids got the message, learnd about giving and appreciation, as well as were introduced to Asian culture. Recommend to ages 3-7
