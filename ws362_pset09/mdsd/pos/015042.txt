Accessibly co-written by Neale Donald Walsch and Brad Blanton, the respective authors of the "Conversations with God" series and the "Radical Honesty" series, Honest To God: A Change Of Heart That Can Change The World is a remarkably insightful book about transforming oneself by accepting honesty and learning to care about more than just oneself or a close inner circle of friends and family. Frank, straightforward discourse reveals the deception that most people embrace and shows a way out to a clearer, more enlightened, and more compassionate strain of thought. A powerful, moving book about self-improvement and the quest to reduce human suffering in the world, Honest To God is highly recommended reading for self-help, self-improvement reading lists and reference collections
