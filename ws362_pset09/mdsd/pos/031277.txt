Even if you're not a cat lover, this book won't fail to intrigue you. It's a mgical journy of cats surviving in the wild as they see life through feline eyes and interpret it so. Their simple philosophy on different situations made me laugh, cry and ponder my life situations. The story is so absorbing that at times I forgort I was reading what a cat was thinking. This was one of a few books that I couldn't wait to read every night and was sad to see it end. I'm giving a copy to all my cat owner friends. Put it in the top ranks with Watership Down.
