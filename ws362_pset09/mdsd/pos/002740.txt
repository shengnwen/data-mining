Muller's latest Sharon McCone mystery is up to her usual standard. McCone's latest employee, Julia Rafael, is charged with credit-card fraud, and McCone doesn't believe it, nor does anyone else who knows her. However, the person accusing her, Alex Aguilar, is a respected member of the Board of Supervisors and founder of a job-training center, and things do not look good.

But McCone's investigation reveals that Aguilar may have plenty to hide, and that, in fact, a frame-up of Julia may have been set in place specifically to ruin McCone. 

One thing I like very much about this series is that McCone and other continuing characters do not remain static. In this book, McCone continues to deal with her reaction to her brother's suicide, to her discovery of her own adoption and reunion with her birth family, and with changes in her relationship with her lover, Hy Ripinsky.

A fast-paced and well-written book.
