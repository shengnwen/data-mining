This Grimoire is very interesting indeed, the author mixes up american Victorian age uses, or at least it looks as if she does, (i am not an expert on Victorian age) with some work of her own. The grimoire is very vast, and so some arguments are not treated with the depth that maybe many would like, but the real goal of a commercial grimoire is in fact the one to inspire ideas, not to be an all comprehensive copycat guide. This Grimoire does exactly this, it gives you food for thought and creative ideas, like using umbrella's, fans, and it makes you want to learn more about many of it's contents. And personal research is a MUST for all pagans, inspiring that research and giving an overview on some parts of it is what a commercial grimoire is about. 5 stars for it's creativity and inspiring parts. My advice is to have it in your library
