About a year ago, I became interested in true crime novels after reading &quot;Righteous Carnage - the John List Murders&quot;.  You can't help but to appreciate the painstaking research that is done to reconstruct these horrible acts of the past.  &quot;A terrible thunder&quot; does a good job in getting the reader literally consumed in the action as it unfolds.  There is rarely a dull moment in the book.  The inset photos, however, are a blurred quality since the event occurred in the early 1970's and could use a little more detail, but overall the book gives you an exciting view into the magnitude of what ultimately materialized at that time in New Orlean's past
