Gary Hamel is one of the leading innovative thinkers of our age. "Only by Pushing the Pedal to the Metal is it Possible to Escape the Limits of Current Processes." The very first chapter, The End of Progress, makes you stand up and take notice. Leading the Revolution is not a calm analysis of what will or won't work in a post-industrial world. Instead, it's an impassioned call for revolutionary activists to shake the foundations of the status quo.

According to Hamel, there is no such thing as good enough. True innovation is the demolition and re-creation of an entire business concept. Like Competing for the Future (reviewed in Byvation, August 2003), Hamel's new book is visionary and forceful, showing how to create and run the companies of tomorrow. Comprised of four sections, "Leading the Revolution's" contents are:

I Facing Up to the Revolution

II Finding the Revolution

III Igniting the Revolution

IV Sustaining the Revolution

Barely ten years old, the World Wide Web is shaking the world's foundation. In reality, this shaking is only a tremor before the big quake - designed to wake us up from our slumber. Once wireless unlocks us from our PC's, our whole society will be changed - just like with the dawn of the automobile. Radical innovation is quickly becoming a prerequisite for success. Those failing to innovate will be relegated to the halls of mediocrity.
