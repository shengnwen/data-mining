The book is easy to follow and interpret even if you are new to this type of thinking.  After reading the book I was so motivated to find a way to heal my own spirit while facing cancer treatment that I decided to attend  the one week program called Return to Wholeness at the Chopra Center for  Well Being in LaJolla CA. I highly recomend the book and program outlined  in the book to anyone who is facing the challanges of cancer treatment
