The Taming of the Shrew is a great read for high school literature classes.  Shakespeare uses love in this play to set up many comical situations.  It is a nice change of pace from the traditional Shakespearian love tragedy which we have all been subjected to.  This book is easily related to by teens.  I personally related to the two suitors for Bianca.  They both wanted her more than anything and were forced to wait because of a shrewd sister and an overbearing father.  This was one book that I had no problem sitting down, reading, and enjoying on my own time.  This book is a necesity for all high school literature classes
