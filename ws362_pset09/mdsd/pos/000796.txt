The reason I bought this book, and all her others, is because I was lucky enough to be in her 2-day seminar.  She DOES practice what she preaches!  In her book, she uses 20 research-based, brain-compatible strategies to motivate and engage learners, enabling them to reach higher test scores. During her seminar, she used  these same 20 strategies with us and they worked!  We actively listened and learned, because she didn't expect us to "sit and get".  We were moving, talking, playing games, writing, drawing, etc...using those 20 brain-friendly strategies.  I am now using these 20 strategies in my classroom.  My math class all tested 100% on their first unit tests!  I will use Marcia Tates books and strategies forever
