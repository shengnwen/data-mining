I found this book to be excellant preparation/background for the  exam. As noted in other reviews, there is not enough detail in all areas and no single book covers everything you need to know, hence only 4 stars. 

I combined this book with the Exam Cram 2 book and a set of Transcender practice exams bought from one of the discount sites, with my exam voucher, and passed.
