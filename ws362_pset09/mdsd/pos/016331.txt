I didn't buy this book, but got it in one of microsoft press' books' cd I've bought. I think it is the 70-350 training kit book.
This guide, which I have only in pdf, is a very useful guide to network admnistrators, devepers and designers. It gives you the exactly information you need about any network protocols, technologies and systems in a short look up. 
It's not a networking course, it's a consultant guide. If you don't know about what networking is and how networks work, don't purchase this item, instead, try buying another book. However, if you are a network professional, order it now, because it's helpful when you are learning something new and need explanation about any network protocol. For instance, you are trying to implement VPN in your environment and, suddenly face with the L2TP word. You go to the M.S. ENC. NETWORKING and look for L2TP. The book will show you a clear understandable explanation of how L2TP works and where to find it.
I hope to have helped you
