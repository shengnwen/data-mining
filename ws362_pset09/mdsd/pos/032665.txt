I have enjoyed Francis Frangipanes's books as he was the first author to  bring my heart to its knees.  God has used him to bring hearts to a new  level of realization that things have got to change around here.  We have  got to focus on our hearts because they will set our destiny.        When  the Lord sets our hearts right, and when we look up, we see a new destiny:   This book of Frangipane details an overwhelming vision he had of heavenly  beings, saints, and the overpowering presence of the Lord Himself.         Frangipane reveals to those of us who are looking toward the Second Coming:   His Presence has started coming in waves.  In the Bible, the prophet  Habakkuk announced that &quot;the earth will be filled with the knowledge  of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea&quot;.  Similarly,  Isaiah fortold that &quot;the Lord rises upon you and His glory appears  over you&quot;.  I have never received such a magnificent revelation  before.       Frangipane believes that God is in the process of preparing  the Bride by healing his people, reviving their first love, and bringing  them together in unity.         This book helps us evaluate and redefine  our relationship with God, while the detailed vision of impending glory  pumps our hearts up with joyful anticipation of our entry into glory
