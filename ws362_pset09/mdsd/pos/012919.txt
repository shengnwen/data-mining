Move over Tom Brokaw! A superbly written and tightly constructed account of human suffering, sacrifice, and bravery beyond description which made a substantial contribution to the Allied victory in World WarII. Largely unacknowledged and ignored by both government and war historians, the &quot;little fellas&quot;are brought to life brilliantly by Ted Treadwell as he poignantly captures the essence of the SC rolethroughout the war.Even as a landlubber I found myself immersed in the wonderfully human stories in every chapter. Ted's style skillfully allows you inside the heads and hearts of countless men who lend new meaning to the definiton of courage. Can I give this book 6 stars
