I bought the book today and I finished it.  Sterns did a great job.  They explained a highly complex developmental theory very simply for everyone who want to learn something on motherhood.  I am psychologist who has been interested in their theory in a very sophisticated way for a very long time but I felt that I learned a lot while reading the book.  Everyone should read this 'tour de force' to understand themselves, their mothers, their chilhood, their motherhood and also their 'fatherhood'. Congratulations Nadia and Dan
