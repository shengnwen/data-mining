My husband and i just recently purchase a Cape house and were use to living in less traditional houses....This book gives us so many inspirations on how to make our new house more us! We took it out of the library before we moved in and.....haven't returned it yet!  I think it's time to get one of our own!  We took out 50+ books but this one was just what we wanted to see sooooo many ideas! Not frumpy - clean lines, open spaces, etc..
