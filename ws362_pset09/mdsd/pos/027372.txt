Holding this hefty book in your hands, you cannot help but admire and respect the editorial efforts of the Brussats. They have put together a dazzling compendium of spiritual wisdom -- and have certainly done a lion's share of promoting many wonderful books that probably wouldn't have gained public attention otherwise! Many of the books they've quoted are now prized possessions on my book shelf, and I am grateful for having had this resource to light the path.

My only caveat -- and maybe it's just my issue -- is the way the book is organized and categorized. I find I have to spend a lot of time with the book before I can navigate its pages and figure out how/where to find things within the categories.  To be fair, there's A LOT of material here, and not being an ediotr, I am not sure if there IS an easier way to package it all for the reader (?) Thankfully, there is a decent index and the book is worth keeping at your bedside for daily inspiration. You can dip into it anywhere and be nourished
