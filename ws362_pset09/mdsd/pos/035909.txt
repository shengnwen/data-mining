I love mysteries and also enjoy books that paint a vivid picture of a time and place.  Peter Robinson does both in this entertaining book. His description of the countryside of the UK during the World War II was wonderful.  Also his description of the trip to London is great.  

Inspector Banks is an interesting character.  I have read a previous book that was early in the series when he was happily married. The only real suggestion is to read these books in order because it is hard to understand Banks out of order.  

This is such a good book it really did not matter that the murderer's identity was not very important.
