Let me start by saying that I always read Nora Roberts books.  If she wrote on cereal boxes, I would read those as well.  Angels Fall, while good, is a little slower to start than others of Roberts' books.  The author takes a good bit of time to develop her characters and to make the fear credible.  But that sometimes gets in the way of the pace of the story.  By the time this book was over, the suspense had picked up, as had the pace.  And the ending was certainly satisfying.  Angels Fall is worth persevering through the slow beginning.  Recommended
