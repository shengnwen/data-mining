No, Diane Mott Davidson's books are not great literary works of art.  They ARE tremendously fun to read.  The main character, Goldy the caterer  (a little plump, a little clumsy, a little goofy, drinks too much coffee) may be you or someone you know!  You will laugh out loud at her some of her predicaments, and feel her pain with the ex and troubles with raising a son.  I've read a few of her books so far and really enjoy the characters, the somewhat simple mysteries and the really great recipes
