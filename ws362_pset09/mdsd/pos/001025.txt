This book breaks down hundreds of drugs so that you understand what they are, how they are used, what dosages, etc. Most every drug you can think of is in here. Each medication has at least one full page dedicated to it. The only drawback I have seen is that some of the drugs have secondary effects, and have been used specifically for those effects, but that is completely overlooked. All in all, if you want to delve deeper into what you are giving your animals, or want to know more about what you should be giving your animals, this is the book for you. I also highly reccomend the Merck Veterinary handbook as these two work very well together
