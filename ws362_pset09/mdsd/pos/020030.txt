I'm writing this review not only because I loved this book but also  because I'm not sure many of the other on-line reviewers understood it very  well.  Mrs. Bridge is not meant to be a heroine -- nor does the author  intend to endorse her views and practices.  The reason for these  misunderstandings is simple:  Connell is a brilliant realist who keeps  himself and his own judgments carefully out of the way; he has such a light  touch, such a deadpan approach, and offers so little help in interpreting  the book's events, that he creates one of the most joyously liberating  literary experiences I've had; unfortunately, he also opens himself up to  radical misinterpretation.  For my own part, I'm almost ready to put  Connell among the 20th century's finest writers (I don't go in for the  usual gang -- Fitzgerald, Nabokov, Joyce ad nauseam are all over-rated and  far too cerebral); this is a moving, painful, hilarious, deeply insightful  and sometimes satirical look at a middle-class woman whose well-meaning  workaholic husband has given her everything and thereby slowly destroyed  her life; she's not a thinker or a go-getter, and has only occasional  moments of beginning to understand what has happened to her (or failed to  happen).  Connell pulls this off without condemning her or her lunk-headed  husband; it's a powerfully compassionate performance, and one of the best  books I've read in the past year.  Very highly recommended.  (Its companion  -- &quot;Mr. Bridge&quot; -- is also excellent, as is the overlooked  Merchant-Ivory film of both books called &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.&quot;
