I am new to fishing, not throwing a pre-rigged line into the water and waiting, but FISHING. I am a single woman who used to have a man do everything for me. Now I am on my own and wanted to learn what to really do to catch fish! This book taught me the basics in easy to understand language with a little humor thrown in so I didn't feel like a dummy at all. There's always more to learn, but this book helped me get out there with the big boys and give them a run for their money! A definite must-have for your fishing library
