I acknowledge the Madman's points:  most of the recipes in this book do not conform to today's dietary standards.  But bear in mind that this book was first written over 70 years ago.  That's when my mother got her copy.  She still has it with the cover's half-torn off and pages stuck in loose and scribbled on.  This was a Pennsylvania Dutch housewife's book of recipes for Pennsylvania Dutch housewives.  They weren't worried about waistlines or BMI numbers.  They needed to feed their families who worked in the fields or guests over for a holiday feast.

I also agree that the strength is the desert section, but that is the specialty of the PA Dutch.  My brother, sister, and I would spend winter days with mother making cookies from the recipes and I even took a turn at making the cream puff recipe once for a church social.  They turned out great!

Not only is this a wonderful recipe book, but to me, it is a family treasure
