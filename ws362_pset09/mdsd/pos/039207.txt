This series is probably fine for adolescents.  It is definitely not as adult friendly as the great "Dark Materials" series.   I read the first two in this series and thought they were okay.  There is some sense of London in a different age.  There is also some excitement.  There is not, however, the depth of a book like "The Golden Compass."

A good book for its intended audience
