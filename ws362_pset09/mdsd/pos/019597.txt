Looking for Rambo? Want John Wayne? Go elsewhere. Miller tells it like it really was for most combat vets. Months of training and monotony punctuated by moments of sheer panic. The best plans go wrong, the toughest troops get tired, hungry, hurt, and do almost comical things while facing death. Miller has the maturity to admit his human frailities but still manages to show that he was indeed one of the best trained, fiercest fighters in the world. I felt his pain lugging overloaded combat packs, trying to stay awake on all-night ambushes, of almost drowning while crossing rivers and streams, and the morality of staring face to face with an armed enemy and wondering if pulling the trigger is the right thing to do.  There's very little military techno-talk in this book, and it can be understood by anyone who was never a soldier but wants to see what it takes to turn a young high school jock into a warrior
