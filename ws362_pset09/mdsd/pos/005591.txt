This oddly titled autobiography is a decidedly good read.  It is not, however, the book most Alan Alda fans (and I am one) would have hoped for.  While always funny, there is a good deal of psycho-analysis of his own psyche and that of his parents which is interesting and engaging but it seems to come at the expense of insights into his many decades as a bonafide celebrity.  He first came to my attention with the movie "The Paper Lion" but this, like much of his film and TV career, gets only cursory mention.  The exception to this general rule is, of course, MASH.  Even so, many readers will find even those passages a little light given the long run of the show.  As much as anything, this is the story of how one becomes an actor and the stage craft that one absorbs over the years if raised in a theatrical environment with entertaining in your DNA.  Fans will like the book and aspiring actors and actresses will probably be more devoted to it
