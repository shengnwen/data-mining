If youve like "after man" by dougal dixon this book is up there with extreme and bizarre ecology. Awesome art and nice species profiles, the only piece i found lacking was the section on herbivorous chameleons, the description was very short and art was extremely lacking. I own quite a few chameleons species myself and the ones i own are more interesting and amazing looking than what was put in the book it would have been better if they didnt include that at all. otherwise a spectacular book id recommend it to anyone with any interest in animals.
