As the Director of Lean Six Sigma for our company, I was looking for a good primer to use to give folks an overview of what our new Lean Six Sigma program would be all about.  This was definitely it!  Mike George's book on Lean Six Sigma was the textbook for my Black Belt training, along with Six Sigma Academy's training program.  But that book, although excellent, is too long to be used as an introduction to LSS.  This was a perfect introduction for everyone in our organization, from the VPs to the factory worker.  Eminently readable, with a good balance of theoretical concepts and practical tools
