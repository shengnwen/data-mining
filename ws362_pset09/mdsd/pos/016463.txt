I am a beginning sock knitter and this book was recommended by my knitting teacher.  The directions in the book are very easy to follow.  I couldn't make sense of how it would work, but my teacher said "just follow the directions explicitly", so I did and lo and behold, I had a sock!  The book is very good at telling you how many stitches you will have left on your needles after you work a certain pattern, so you can easily spot a mistake.  There are also helpful explations of certain techniques.  My only criticism would be that the socks, as patterned, are quite large (the book tells you this), so if you have tiny feet you may have to change the gauge.  This isn't just a beginner's book though; there are some very beautiful and intricate patterns in it.
