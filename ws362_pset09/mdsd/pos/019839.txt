I liked this book. Not only for the interresting portrayal of specific Ottoman period and characters which were zealously researched that makes the book a higly capturing adventourous journey throughout the time but also for the reflection of the authors' opinion based on factual information. I did not feel compelled to agree or disagree with the author and thought it was only fair to build up on the historical documents and accessible data. This feature gave the book rather a different (and more desirable) taste rather than the one that can be found in a mere historical compilation. The author also was not trying too hard with the tone of the book as was the case in "Lord of the Horizons". Enjoyable, easy to read, an exciting book
