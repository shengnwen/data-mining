Whatever period Beverley chooses to write about her characters are so full of depth, heart and emotion that it is always a pleasure to pick up one of her books and dive in for an emotional ride.  This book about Tyron and Imogeen (although I prefer to call her Ginger) was so well done. Imogeen is 16, hard to believe so much horror could be dumped on her at such a young age. No wonder she was barely able to deal with some of it rationally. She showed great strength in going to her neighbor Tyron Fitzroger to regain her Castle but was totally unprepared in dealing with him as a woman, that he would expect to marry. The way her mind was manipulated by the priest was so frustrating to read, but Tyron's realization that she was so young and his patience with "Ginger" was beautifully written. Tyron was so strong and yet he had enough of a vulnerable streak to make him one of the best heroes I've read about recently. The Middle Ages is not usually my favorite time period to read about but this Beverley book was first rate and I highly recommend it. I also highly recommend her Malloren and Rogue series!
