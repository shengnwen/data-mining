I first started reading the shopaholic series when I was in London 4 years ago. While this book didn't measure up to the other books in the series, it definately is a fun light read.  I'm not sure how I feel about how it fits into the series, but I can't wait for Shopaholic and Baby.  If you want a quick funny, witty read, you can't go wrong with this
