To the gentleman who tried to refute that a BAC level of .4 was lethal, and that 4.0 was possible...ummm, how could your blood alcohol level be more than 100%, let alone 400%?  And the success rate of AA being 75%?  Give me a break.  Show me a study.  The true rate of sobriety for those that "walk thru the doors" of AA after 5 years is &lt;5%. Yes, that includes those that are court-ordered, just curious, etc., but I've been "in the rooms" and I know, by my personal experience, that the success rate of continued sobriety (say of 10 years or more) of those that stay in the program that long.....does not approach 75%.  I know what the program is all about, and courts ordering people into it is a serious violation of the separation of church and state.  Yes, there is a "chapter to the agnostic", at the end of which, the "agnostic" falls to his knees, says, "who am I to say there is no God" and feels the overpowering glory of Jeeaahsus flow thru his body. This book shows there are alternatives.  Like just living your life w/o alcohol.  A line I heard a bunch in AA was, well, if you know you're allergic to shellfish (the "big book" says alcoholics have an "allergy" to alcohol; no, it's actually a chemical process in the brain that is similar to a heroin addiction in true "alcoholics") why would you eat shellfish? (using an analogy to why would an alcoholic drink alcohol).  Well, if I'm allergic to shellfish, why would I sit around with a bunch of people and talk about how glad I am I'm not eating lobster and shrimp today?  I think I'll stay home with my family and have a salad and an iced tea, thank you.
ps, your beloved BW dropped acid during his "sobriety".  Little bit of trivia for y'all
