As usual, J.A. Jance has provided a great piece of entertainment. Rather than using a detective or police officer as the main character, she uses an ex-anchor for an LA local news station who becomes a blogger. For those of you not familiar with the term "blogger" it is a person who keeps a journal, or log, on the web and makes regular posts. Ali, the heroine of the novel, posts her story on the web and finds that she now has contact with her audience she never experienced before - contact that can be life-threatening.
As is her practice, Ms. Jance keeps the reader involved with the people in her story by making them come alive with friends, relatives and villans. Give her story a read - you'll be surprised
