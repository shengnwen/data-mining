This autobio is written in simple and straightforward language by the Man In Black himself. Our family has been fans of Cash long before the new Hollywood hit 'Walk the Line' hit cinemas last year. However, this new wave of Cash in the spotlight has reminded us all of his remarkable story. Johnny's simple faith allowed him to beat the 'demons' and live out the rest of His life in truth and always attributing Glory where it was due. June was his guardian angel, if you ask me. God definitely gave him a gift when he brought June into his life. His story is a touching one and will show you the power of prayer and godly people in one's life. An easy read and worth every second spend reading it. =
