A mostly great book, with a substantive review of the history of 'real' 911s, a huge amount of sound advice on maintenance and overhauling, detailed pictures of such arcana as variants of cylinder heads over the years, and practical, experienced advice on how to proceed if you are really determined to screw up your 911 by modifying it.  The book is flawed only by being written from a &quot;California&quot; point of view, meaning lots of pictures of slantnoses and whatnot and too much encouragement to those who think badly-engineered aftermarket parts will actually &quot;improve&quot; on Porsche's incredible design.  Still, if you have an air-cooled 911, and you have *any* inclination at all to work on it yourself, you need this book
