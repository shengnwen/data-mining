I bought the book while in Gettysburg and read it nonstop on the flight home. It's a quick read and will definitely keep your interest. I highly recommend the movie Gettysburg as well, and having read the book will provide deeper insight than what a movie can do. Above all, visit Gettysburg, as touring the sites and seeing the terrain will make The Killer Angels come alive. It did for me
