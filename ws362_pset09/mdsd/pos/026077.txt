This text is a solid foundation for any advanced American History course. It is not meant to be read for its jokes and extraneous information but to be critically read and its facts absorbed. The facts in this book are laid out in a straight, neat and chronologically ordered fashion with annotations about further information, etc. This book has helped me to so far stay above water in my AP US History course and goes hand in hand with many other course books
