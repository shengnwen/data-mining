I'm embarrassed to confess this, but I actually bought this book by way of co-author Mark Ebner's urging in an AOL authors chat room.  He shamelessly directed me to his blog, http://www.hollywoodinterrupted.com, and I click-through purchased the paperback here on Amazon. I then read Hollywood, Interrupted in one sitting, and now I feel less embarrassed being comforted by the fact that the book begins and ends with silly instant message sessions conducted by the authors. 

In between their late night online chats, the authors composed an uncompromising pastiche of passages (How's that for alliteration?)devoted to exposing the town that they clearly love to hate. The result?  I loved it!

Then I went back to Ebner's blog and discovered why this guy seems so desperately egotistical about getting noticed.  His journalism rocks!

So, Ebner...  Now that I've read and reviewed your work, you are forgiven for being such a shameless self-promoter.
