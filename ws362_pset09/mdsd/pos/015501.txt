Halfway through the book, I was worried.  Katie MacAlister is constantly in danger of letting her sense of comedy overwhelm her novels - losing the meat of characters, momentum, tension, etc., in her desire to punch out something irreverant, spunky, and lightly entertaining.  For a while, I was really worried that she was going to ruin Fire Me Up and Aisling Grey by turning it into a (not necessarily funny) sketch routine.

But she didn't!  

What counterbalances the broad comedy so well in Fire Me Up is the sheer unfairness of Aisling's situation - you'd have to be quite a cynic to dream up all of the awful things that she experiences in this book.  She is blamed, suspected, betrayed, misjudged, and patronized at every turn.  

This novel has a satisfying narrative arc, while also leaving room for the situation to change in later novels as Aisling and the other characters evolve.  The action centers around a conference of Otherworlders in Budapest, and a couple of murders committed there.  Once again Aisling is a suspect and scrambling to clear her name.  

She's also looking for a mentor, adapting to her new role as a Guardian and hoping to learn enough to do the job right.  And Drake appears as well - for a not-so-coincidentally timed conference of dragon wyverns.  A lot of things happen on that front - Aisling finds herself embroiled in dragon politics, intra- and extra-sept, and back in a love/hate sort of relationship with Drake.  (I, too, had a love/hate relationship with him in this book).

By the end I was totally enthralled and happy with the book and I can't wait to read the next one
