In "The Secret of Sarah Revere," author Ann Rinaldi takes us back to Boston for another young woman's story.  This time the woman is Sarah, daughter of silversmith Paul Revere, and the time period is right before the American Revolution begins in earnest.

When the story begins, Paul Revere has taken his famous ride warning the colonies that "the British are coming," and everyone wants to know about it.  Revere also supposedly saw the first shot fired at a famous battle, the knowledge of which could hurt the colonies' case against the British.  

It is this monumental secret that sets Sarah thinking about the events leading up to Revere's ride, as well as the many other secrets that her family members are hiding from each other.   Several of her family members are involved in the movement against the British, so there are many things that remain unspoken in her house.    Chief among them is Sarah's fear that her stepmother and her father's best friend might be having an affair.  

Sarah is quick to jump to conclusions and slow to clear the air with her family members regarding her fears.  Her father, on the other hand, teaches her the value of trust, even if it seems blindly placed, in a time when you must choose to trust your neighbors or go crazy with suspicion.  Sarah is an admirable character, fiercely loyal to her family, and struggling with new feelings she has never experienced before.

I read this book right after finishing "The Fifth of March," and was pleasantly surprised by how neatly it ties in with that book.  Not just because it's a continuation of the Revolutionary period (begun in "Fifth of March") but also because several characters from "Fifth of March" appear or are referenced in "Secret."
