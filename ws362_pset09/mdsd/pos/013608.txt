A book recommended by my mother many years ago, I just now got to it, and have since lost my mother (5 years ago) to a slow progressive death...this book opened a raw wound, and so I was glad to have delayed this experience until now.  Brutally honest, the book is a must for all those daughters out there, I had a closer relationship with my mother than the book's narrator, but oddly we experienced a similar process and grief and loss have unexpected and surprising impacts on families!
Read it when you are feeling strong and ready for the real deal!
Brilliant and ballsy, gut wrenching writing!  5++++ stars
