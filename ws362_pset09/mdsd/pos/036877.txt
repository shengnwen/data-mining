It would be quite easy to mock at this little self - help work with statements like ' You'd better be your own best friend since no one else is ' but in fact this work is a valuable guide to increasing one's own self- esteem. The authors emphasize the importance of the individual valuing their own accomplishments, taking responsiblity for their own life, and using their freedom with wisdom. Berkowitz and Newman who are a married couple of psychotherapists present the work in a very simple and forthright manner, as a kind of conversation in which they answer questions about how to make a happy life. Their stress is on overcoming the routines of past failure and finding new ways to bring satisfaction into one's life. It is hard to quarrel with their prescription. 
To put it into practical effect, however, is I think for most of us the real problem and story.
