I stumbled across the title of this book doing research on the Black Death.  What a find!!  I just couldn't put it down and love how tightly Connie Willis weaves her stories.  This launched me on a new search for anything she has ever written.  Without doubt she is my favorite author!!!  The characters are so well developed and the story line is positively captivating.  What a great movie this book would make, and yet it is not in any way written like a screenplay (thinking of how M.Crichton's books denigrated from great books to poor screenplays)
