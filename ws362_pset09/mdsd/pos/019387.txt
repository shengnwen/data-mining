Ted Nace has written an intreaging story on American corporate history in Gangs of America.  Starting in the 17th century with the Founding Fathers, we witness railroad barons play powergames with Washington judges from the Supreme Court, get to know historical figures like Tom Scott, Stephen Field and Lewis Powell jr. All these people have played a part in the rise from American corporation, from local organisation in the midth of the 19th century to world dominant players as we know them nowadays. What happened was a great game where business, political and juridical objectives meet. 
The events and people Nace describe have their influence till today: the position of many business people in the Bush administration! the role of the tens of thousands lobists? the protest and fears of "globalists" against the power and influence of corporate America on world politics!

Ted Nace has written a beautiful tale, probably unknown to most of us, working in modern corporations. Knowledge of the US political and juridical system is handy. Of course some parts of the text are somewhat dry, other are very colorfull. The full text of the book can be downloaded at www.gangsofamerica.comwhere a lot of background information can be found.
