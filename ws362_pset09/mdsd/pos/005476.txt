the polish is chalky and comes off in hours or maybe a day. Maybe that's a good thing since my daughter only wants to polish her own nails/toes. I let her use the kit with her friends- outside- and they spilled polish but it wiped RIGHT OFF the table (plastic)and even came off the garage floor with a quick wipe. Good step by step directions for some cute designs in here too. you probably need a thinner brush to really have the look they suggest, but i had one from Michael's we used. FUN GIF
