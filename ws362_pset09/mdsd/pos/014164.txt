This book is an interesting addition to the story of Easy Company as chronicled in Band of Brothers.  It is the story of one highly literate enlisted man's view of the war.  It lacks the overview of the war in Ambrose's book and is much more cynical.  Before reading it, I would recommend first reading Ambrose's Band of Brothers and Winters' Biggest Brother
