Basically I recommend this book which I "read" as a book on tape.  The theme is "a man's life"---and the "emptiness of life"-------and the search for "the meaning of life".   You may perceive certain aspects of YOUR life in the life story  of Mr. Babbitt.  Thus, you finish the book with the idea,  "Hey, this author understands me"....."I'm not alone.  "Other people have intermittant  feelings of "meaningless of life" and I'm not alone."  You probably will get "bored" with some long-winded passages but overall the book is worth reading.  Don't expect any "deep answers" to the meaning of life.  But, the book does have a "satisfying" ending.  Email:  boland7214@aol.c
