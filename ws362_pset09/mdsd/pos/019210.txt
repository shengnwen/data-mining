My parish book group chose this for our gatherings and we are still reaping the benefits of this wonderful collection.  We read one story per month and then come together for discussion.  The stories touch our lives  and are the foundation of fruitful and rich dialogue.  As a mother of small  children with limited time to myself, I particularly appreciate the  opportunity to enjoy such wonderful gems of literature in small bites
