When this book was recommended as the pre-read for a Caroline Myss workshop, I was apprehensive.  I thought it might be way beyond my comprehension.  To my delight I found the book very readable, highly  interesting, provocative in the ideas and sound in application.  Have you  ever read a book and wished it was a workshop?  This is it!  Encore,  Pascal
