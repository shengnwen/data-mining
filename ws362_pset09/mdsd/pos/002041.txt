Brother Cadfael is both pleased and displeased when his old love, Richildis, arrives at the Abbey with her husband, to take up residence as a permanent lodger. In return for permanent food, shelter and all things comfortable, Richildis's husband, Gervase Bonel, proposes to deed the ownership of his manor to the Abbey, a fact which does not sit well with his stepson, Edwin, to whom was promised ownership of the manor. In old age, Gervase had grown cantankerous and had taken a spiteful pleasure in goading Edwin into a rage about reneging on his promise of passing on the ownership of the manor to him. After eating a highly spiced and sauced dish of partridge, Gervase dies, and suspicion immediately falls on Edwin. The dish was poisoned with monkshood, an oil made of which, was brewed by Cadfael to use as a liniment for the old and arthritic monks. As usual in a Cadfael story, there are several characters who have equal reason and opportunity to have committed the murder, so it's up to Cadfael to sort out the mystery. It's another fascinating story, set in the 12th century, with a wealth of detail about mediaeval life and with Brother Cadfael sorting out the clues
