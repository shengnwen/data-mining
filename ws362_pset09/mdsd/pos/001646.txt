Under the cover of `Light Shining in Buckinghamshire' Caryl Churchill takes the reader through the experience of revolution, encouraging thought and moral criticism from the audience. Her characters are entertaining and  each introduces the themes of personal freedom in autocratic and  dictatorial societies well. This historically based play does not introduce  the audience to the English Civil but to the situation of those that live  through and fight for any form of revolution, becoming relevant to modern  society as well. Caryl Churchill removes the third wall of the traditional  play encouraging the audience not only to view, but also to participate and  act within the play itself. Not only thoroughly entertaining but almost  haunting in its ability to make you think and analyse the ideas introduced  for yourself
