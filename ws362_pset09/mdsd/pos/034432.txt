I orginally found this book in my grandfather's bookcase in the mid 1950s. It has been my all time favorite book ever since. Christopher Morley is an early feminist...Helen is a role model. It is a treasure and great fun to read aloud to anyone in the mood to laugh and be charmed by an enchanting story
