The author is to be commended in making this important part of Western civilization's history exciting and vibrant on the written page.

One cannot help but be inspired by the great heroes of reason, who while devout monotheists, also held to the truth of this world no matter what the cost. It was also interesting to know that the Catholic Church as an organization, at times, was a great champion of Aristotle, however much a paradox that might appear at first hearing.  It is ideas such as that make this book a sheer joy to read.

However, the author's opinions on the relationship between faith and reason/science are a little disappointing.  In my view, faith and reason cannot be reconciled -- they are built upon different foundations.  The conflict remains: faith vs. reason, Plato vs. Aristotle, Augustine vs Aquinas.  A main theme of this book is that in Christian Europe there was an attempt at reconciling the two.  However flawed such a marriage might be, it was a necessary step and transition to the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment (and its climax in the creation of the United States of America).  All these later movements owe much to Thomas Aquinas, who let Aristotle loose in Chistendom
