I'm a wannabe bluewater cruiser and this is the first book I bought to learn about this adventure. I would highly rate this book for basic and technical information, with some limitations. Neale covers all the systems on the boat and the problems and the advantages of each. There are four limitations of the book though. First of all he is a coastal cruiser primarily and the open ocean sailing part is not there. Secondly, there is some other info that's left out. An example is anchoring. He discusses this thoroughly because of its importance, but never tells you what a CQR or Danforth anchor really is. I know there are limitations on length. Also, he never mentions product names. It would be good to have some names of products that really worked well or were dismal failures. This is probably my biggest gripe. And some cost factors too. We can adjust for the time factor. But again, this is a great book. I understand much more how the electrical inverters, toilets, stoves, water systems, frigs, etc. operate on a boat and why I do or don't need them. Buy this book if you're looking for a good read that's loaded with info
