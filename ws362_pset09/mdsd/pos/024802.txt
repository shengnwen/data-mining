In the not-too-distant future, Daisy, a Manhattan resident, is sent to live with her cousins on the English countryside.  At first, the English countryside is something of a paradise.  Daisy forms an instant bond with her cousin Edmond, and she spends her days gallivanting with her cousins.  Until the war comes.  A nameless enemy invades England.  At first, Daisy and her cousins live in a sort of untouched paradise, separated from the war by the countryside.  But then the war finds them, and Daisy and her cousin Piper are separated from the boys.  

This book is clever and engaging and it draws you in and then it breaks your heart.  I didn't expect the direction the book took.  It shocked me.  I kept thinking that something would change, that the direction would turn back, but it didn't, and that is the brilliance of this book.  It is a war story, and in war, things often start out kind of okay and then move to awful.  It feels true.  It hurts.  Daisy's voice is incredibly vivid - I can almost hear it in my head even now, a week after reading it.  Daisy, her family, her world - they all stand out in stark colors in my head.  This is one of those great books that lingers in your heart after you've finished reading
