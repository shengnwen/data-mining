I have been fascinated with Amazon.com since its inception. This book is a humorous account of the early days of the online bookseller.

I have read other reviews that were less than complimentary but it's a great book.  The key is that you have to be interested in Amazon.com to be interested in this book.  I found the author's narrative very funny and entertaining, spoken from a true geek!  

I could not honestly put this book down
