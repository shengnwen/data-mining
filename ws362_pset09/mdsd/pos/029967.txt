I read this book based on a recommendation from Guy Kawasaki (popular business blogger) and found it very inspiring. IMHO, the writing felt a little bumpy because I kept getting distracted by the author's footnote commentary.

To be fair though, I have gotten a lot out of it and will admit that is has taken away a lot of my fear of criticism when starting my own blog for fun. Her perspecitive is nice and I agree with her spiritual outlook.

All in all I would rate it as one of the better books I have read in the past couple of months.
