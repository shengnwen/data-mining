There is something quite appealing about this author's work and this particular series.  To be honest, I have not read a bad book in the whole bunch and this one is certainly no exception.  We have plenty of synopses already written here, so I will leave that to others and just say, briefly, that two members of the group need to be replaced and this is the search for those new members.  The author certainly has a native ability to tell a good story, great syntax and her character developement is absolutely great.  These are comfortable books to read as you can always be pretty assured that right will rule out.  In this day and age, that is sort of nice, i.e., nice to be able to rely upon.  Now keep in mind, this is coming from a guy who has never made or even watched a quilt being made. (although I do enjoy the shows my wife takes me to).  I do enjoy a good, well written story though.  My wife turned me on to these books and for that I am truely grateful.  Job well done Ms Chiaverini, thank you
