A good book describing the Boot Camp experience to parents who are about to send their sons/daughters off to Great Lakes Training Command. Written in 2000, the book is already slightly dated, as I believe many of the improvements discussed in the book have been done at this time.

Written by a gentleman who was in the Navy during the Vietnam era, he was given total access to the base, from the Commander on down to the recruits and instructors. He followed a specific recruit class from their homes to graduation.

Well written, it could be read by your son/daughter if so desired before shipping out, and should be read by their parents
