I love to browse through different cookbooks.  I have quite a collection, and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before I decide to purchase the entire book.  I normally look for 3 things in a cookbook, besides delicious recipes that will work for my family.  This includes:
1)  Pictures of more than ¾ of the recipes (Color pictures are the best)
2)  A spiral binding, or at least on that easily lays flat
3)  New & innovative recipes that have ingredients I can easily find at a grocery store

For this book, I was intrigued by the amount of different barbeque recipes that it contained, grouped by season so that you choose different recipes from winter, summer, spring, and fall.  Like many people, I mainly use my barbeque during the warm summer months, but this book gave us a ton of new ideas for recipes that appeal all year long.

The downside of the book was that it offered no photographs, and was not in a binding that laid flat.  I liked the recipes, but thought that the lack of pictures of the finished products could hold some back from purchasing the book.

Some of our favorites include:  Sautéed White Mushrooms, Rack of Pork, Dr. BBQ Barbecued Barbecue Shrimp, Shamrock Potatoes, Fake Sugar Cupcakes, and Peachy Pork Steaks.  Enjoy!
