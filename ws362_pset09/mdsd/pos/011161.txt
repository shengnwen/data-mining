Make that the Impossible Four.  The Barrett kids are a lot to handle, but they're out of control because their mother doesn't TAKE control, making Mrs. Barrett the most impossible of all.  

This is Dawn's first book.  She finds herself trying to make nice with Kristy, who's unhappy with the idea of moving across town when her mother gets remarried.  Dawn understands and works hard to overcome Kristy's jealousy over Mary Anne and Dawn's new friendship.  That's part of the reason she takes on the Barretts as new clients.  She never expected them to become the challenge they turn out to be.  How things work out - and they always do - is something you'll have to read the book to find out!

References to Morbidda Destiny, who stars in Karen's first Baby-Sitters Little Sister book, are a nice way to tie the two series together.  I only hope I can someday catch up with Martin's prolific pen
