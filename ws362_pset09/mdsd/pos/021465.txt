As usual, James Rollins has such an interesting style of writing that it draws you fast forward without you being aware of it. Even if you are not a fan of science fiction or future science, the characters draw you in until you are there, involved in the middle of the story.  The writing pulls at you, drawing you faster and faster like the pull of white water rapids on a oarless canoe. Plan on reading this when you have plenty of time, because once you start, it will be impossible to stop
