The Road to Mumbai is a wonderfully written, colorfully illustrated children's book, which adults can enjoy too. 

It is a cute and humorous tale of a little girl named Shoba and her monkey, Fuzzy Patel (insert smiles here) and their journey to Mumbai, via her bed and various other modes of transportation along the way. The story and pictures capture the essence of the people and animals they meet on the road to Fuzzy's cousin's wedding.

Ms. Jeyaveeran has accomplished much in her first book. I look forward to her next one
