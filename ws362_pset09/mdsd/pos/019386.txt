The two accounts in _Chronicles of the Crusades_ provide readers with fascinating accounts of the 4th and 7th crusades.  Villehardoun's observations of the sack of Constantinople leave some questions regarding whether it was a conspiracy to destroy the city or not; ultimately it is up to the reader to decide...  It does, however, provide a window into 12th century warfare and politics.  

Joinville's chronicle of the 7th crusade into the Holy Land was similarly fascinating, providing more information about a European's impressions of the Near East and Christian-Islamic conflict than Villehardoun.  I much preferred Joinville for this reason.  Together, both accounts provide a well-rounded history of the time and place - a tremendously interesting read for professional and armchair historians alike
