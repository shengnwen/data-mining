Constance Reid has created a gem of a book about  her sister.  Beginning with the information that all royalties will go for mathematical scholarships at Julia's high school, through to Yuri Matijasevich's slightly technical essay, informed with equal parts of love for Julia and  for Hilbert's Tenth Problem, there is a consistency of tone that shows  Constance Reid to be a true artist of book creation.  The tenacity,  reticence, and generosity that Julia brought to her mathematical life are  conveyed to the reader in every aspect of the book.  Give this to anyone  who does not yet understand that the passion for truth makes fine human  beings.  Although it is consistently played down, the shocking  discrimination against women emerges consistently throughout the book.   Julia Robinson gave abundantly to the world despite illness,  discrimination, and other obstacles.  Her very generous spirit shines  through the pages of this book.  Do yourself a favor, and read this  beautiful tribute from Constance Reid, Lisl Gaal, Martin Davis, Yuri  Matijasevich, and the Mathematical Association of America to Julia Bowman  Robinson
