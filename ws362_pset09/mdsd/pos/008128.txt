The Book "The Right Moment" by Matthew Dallek is an important piece of balanced research into the 1966 campaign for Governor of California.  The race chronicles one conservative (actor turned politician) verse an old guard liberal who dominated California politics for the last eight years named Pat "The Giant Killer" Brown.  

This book makes a few very important cases.  One being Reagan benifited from the changing trends in politics nationally as well as in California.  There is no doubt there is truth in that but it is also important to note that Reagan did what no other modern conservative had done and that is win big.  Dallek understands that it was Reagan's skill plus the right times which brought about a national change.  Riots, Vietnam, and the failings of the Great Society turned America into a nation ripe for political change.  Reagan was the man who lead the revolution from California and eventually ending with the demise of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

Dallek also understands what many authors do not and that is Reagan ran a mainstream conservative campaign from California on into the White House.    

It is also important to note that this book chronicles the life, campaigns, and ambition of Pat Brown who was a very able politician who knocked off former Vice President Richard Nixon in 62 who challenged Brown's hold on Sacramento. 

 Much of the problem with Brown was that he underestimated Reagan (which would not be the last time an incumbent did that) and failed to quell the anarchy in Watts and Berkley.  

If you enjoy studying Ca politics, political campaigns, or political history this book is very valuable and brings out a lot of new information on the 66 Governor's race.  Another strong quality is the balanced approach "The Right Moment" offers and its obviously well researched.  I believe more could have easily been written about the 66 race.
