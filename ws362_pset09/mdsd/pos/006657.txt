I got a kick reading the reviews of "Jockstrap" and wanted to respond to the previous comment doubting the veracity of my story, "Mama Chihuahua: World's Fiercest Travel Partner."
As the daughter of Mama Chihuahua, I can assure you that she has temper and strength enough to knock over several men. If you've ever known someone cursed (or blessed, depending on the situation) with rage, you might be familiar with the miraculous ability of adrenaline to magnify even a small person's might. 
My mother has a good sense of humor and, although she is slightly embarrassed about her occasional rage, she continues to get a little gleam in her eyes when she remembers the day she let her full force out on those hapless taxi drivers. 
Wish us good luck on our trip to India! I just hope that my mother's inner lap dog comes out more often than her inner Chihuahua. ;
