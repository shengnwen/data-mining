This is a very enjoyable, informative and well written book which does a very good job of tackling various aspects of the Medieval Europe, covering the tale end of the dark ages and taking the reader through to the end of what we consider the 'middle ages.'  While informative it is never dry and frequently witty.  I could only wish that the photos throughout were in color rather than black and white.
