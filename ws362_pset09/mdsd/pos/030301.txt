You can't go wrong with any book by Vivekananda. Not only was he a great scholar, he was a saint and mystic who had personally experienced the things he taught. This book gives an extremely clear description of Raja Yoga from both a practical and philosophical standpoint. The first half explains the philosophical concepts of Hinduism regarding the relationships between mind, matter, and spirit. The second half of the book walks you through the ancient Yoga Sutras.
