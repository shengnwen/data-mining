Admittedly, I didn't read this book until Alford took over as head coach of the Iowa Hawkeyes. But, I could not put the book down. The Knight &quot;war stories&quot; are enough to make you scratch your head and the  complete enthusiasm Alford has for his game is very awe inspiring. Yes,  Hawkeye fans will love this book, too
