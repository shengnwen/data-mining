A Bear Named Trouble is a book that even I couldn't put down!  My daughter and I started reading it at night before bed and while we normally read one chapter a night, it didn't happen with this book.  Two or three chapters later, I'd finally say it was time for lights out. The storyline is fabulous and since Trouble is a real bear at the Lake Superior Zoo, it gives it a whole new meaning for readers. It was fun to finish the book, learn that Trouble is real and research him at the zoo's website.  I recommend this book for any animal lover out there and I look forward to reading more by Marion Dane Bauer
