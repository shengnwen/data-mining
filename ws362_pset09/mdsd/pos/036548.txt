I really enjoyed this book, but it has been a while since I read it.   I can still remember many parts of the book:  The sisters' car ride, the snake wrestling, the vivid description of the thought process of someone on crack and the description of events in the water tower.  I never had the impression that the book was to long, but missed it when it was over.  Her previous book, The Secret History was equally enjoyable
