Robert Olen Butler has inspired writers in many ways over many years: via webcasts, workshops, lectures, readings, in manuals, and by the example of his work.  "Severance" is the latest distillation of his talent and creative wit, served up for us as a gruesome but gorgeous imagining and garnished with bookmaking craft excellence. Any way one, well, slices it,  "Severance," the book, is an object of haptic and visual beauty; "Severance," the stories (or, better, vignettes), is a master work of concept, research and passionate prose.  As I did, you will read it quickly then find yourself going back for more, often.  As a Writer and a Reader, I highly recommend "Severance" to those familiar with Butler's short stories, collections (Good Scent, Tabloid Dreams, Had A Good Time) and novels, but I especially envy those who pick up this book and discover the voices of Bob Butler for the first time
