I was starting to wonder if they were ever going to wrap up Voss' story. I found it very compelling and great continuity. I was waiting for the payoff on the Vos story line. I also like how it leaves the future open for more of his story. The story arc ended nicely. I would recommend this especially at the low price of Amazon. Worth the read
