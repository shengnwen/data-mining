This is a reference book, not a narrative history. Other reviews seem to miss the point of this book. It helps you see what was happening around the world in any given year. If you know nothing about the people and events of history, you need more of a narrative presentation. If you have some historical knowledge, it's a fascinating way to cross-reference thoughts, ideas, people and events. And if you want to know more you can always look it up in more depth. Use this book how it's intended and you won't be dissatisfied
