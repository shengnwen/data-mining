I began to learn the piano about 3 years ago, just after I retired. 

I have found "Practicopedia" full of useful ideas for practice which I have been using.  My practice sessions are now far more organised.  I am also hoping Philip's techniques will help me to learn my pieces more thoroughly and with less or no need to unlearn wrong notes etc.

I did have some trouble finding my way around at first. For example, there was no entry in the Chapter Guide on starting a new piece.  However, I later found it in the Usher section which is a very useful compilation of Practiceopedia refences to address particular problems.

I can thoroughly recommend this book for mature (late starters) students who like to be well-organised.  I am sure they will benefit from its advice.
