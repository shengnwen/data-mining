I like this book and re-read it occasionally.  The reviews with individuals are helpful in gettin a semi-diverse opinion of the troubles of our world.  Some interviews are definately better than others so do not expect all interviews to blow you away.  I have marked 10 or so and come back to these occasionally in order to re-inspire myself.
