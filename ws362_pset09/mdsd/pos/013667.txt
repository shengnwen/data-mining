Ms. Roy is a very unusual writer. What an extraordinary look at cast, politics, love, loss, and culture. I can not say that I love Ms. Roy's writing, but her story is powerful and a must read. My wife however loves her writing. Ms. Roy takes analogy to a new level. As in other books that I have read on India, this book provides a glimpse into culture, love, and loss and will challenge your sense of justice
