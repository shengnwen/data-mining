On The Bank Of Plum Creek is about the Ingalls family's life in Minnesota. This story is about the hard and rough winter and the hard times they had with crops. It's also about the fun and excitement of school friends and playing along the water. I really liked this book and I think all ages would like this book too. It is the Fourth book in the Little House On The Prairie series
