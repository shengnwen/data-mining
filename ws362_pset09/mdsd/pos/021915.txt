Gelder and Thornton have pulled together a book that I could have based my entire senior thesis upon as the sole source. Most subculture studies anthologies rely too much on the British school of thought. While that was  the seminal work in the field, there's been a *few* more developments since  the sixties :) Gelder and Thornton realize this, and draw from almost a  full century of subculture studies. Each progression in the field is  grouped into a new chapter, with a cohesive introduction section.  Some  chapter will take a serious sociologist to manage full appreciation - the  &quot;sociologese&quot; can get thick when individual authors are trying to  obscure the fact that their thesis is a &quot;stretch&quot; to put it  mildly. But the book on the whole is a great resource for anyone involved  in subculture studies - a good range, considerable depth, and  reader-friendly organization for those not yet versed in the particulars of  the field
