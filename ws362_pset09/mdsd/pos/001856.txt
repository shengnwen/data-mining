i know, sounds silly, but i picked up an old hardback of armin k. lobeck's masterpiece from a street "vendor" in new york about 15 years ago. paid 25c for it. it has influenced my perception of maps, geology, and the histories of the earth, life, and civilization ever since. it's a simple book, really, but full of concepts and ideas that you just don't get anywhere else here in the 21st century. also, the (hand drawn) illustration is unusually enlightening while exhibiting a charm and elegance that is lost on graphic designers these days.

the only reason anyone would ever go to the trouble of producing a document like this is because they were truly passionate about the ideas they were presenting. it's very sincere, and you'll never look at maps (or the world) the same way again
