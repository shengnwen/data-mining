Lewisohn is the only writer with fully authorized access to the Beatles archives and vault at EMI. This work, a combination of several prior books, therefore, gives the most accurate picture of the Beatles work in live performances, broadcasts, and in the studio. It lives up to its ambitious title, and gives complete details of every performance and studio session. Not a narrative history, but an indispensable reference work
