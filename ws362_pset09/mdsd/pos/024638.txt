I have just replaced my tattered copy of the seminal five star &quot;Spraycan Art&quot; book. This was the first and only book to follow graffiti art out of the NYC subways and around the world. Not only did the book name the art form, but the authors obviously knew and found the key writers of their time. Witness the visionary choice of Mode 2, age 15, on the cover. ....Thirteen years after being first printed, this book is still a vital reference for all of us who are interested in the graffiti aspect of Hip-Hop. I, for one, am grateful that Chalfant and Prigoff were willing to spend the enormous time and effort that was obviously necessary to capture this historic period on film, give voice to the writers through the interview process, and to make available important historic information
