Dan S. Cohen's "The Heart of Change Field Guide" is a must-read call-to-action for managers, project managers, and anyone who wants to implement permanant, beneficial change in their lives and within their organizations or families.   While the first book, "The Heart of Change," provides a framework and many success stories to get you motiviated, the "Field Guide" gives you the tools and coaching to implement what was taught.

The Field Guide contains many workbook sheets that are very useful.  While the book is copyrighted, there is an e-mail address listed on the copyright page to ask for permission to duplicate the worksheets
