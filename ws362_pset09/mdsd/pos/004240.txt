Dekker really finishes off the Circle Trilogy with style. 
This book was by far the best of the 3 and, although you really must read the first 2 to truly understand this book, Dekker does not dissapoint with the conclusion to this very long trilogy. 
The story, including the metaphors of Christ's sacrifice for mankind, is brought home and shows the truly great talent that Dekker has for writing. 
In this final installment, we are shown how the virus from this world is destroyed due to the sacrifice of one man. 
I cannot really say much more except that this trilogy is fascinating, truly enthralling and worth every minute that you spend reading it. It is a fantasy story that few people could claim to create and it is do beautifully written that you believe that the dream world exists. Dekker has an unexplainable way of describing the imaginary and delivering a wonderful story that is impossible to put down. 
A definite must read for any fantasy fan and just about anyone else that enjoys a book that is just a little bit left or right of center, delivering a unique reading experience with fantastic creatures, wonderous imaginary lands and riveting suspsense. My only complaint about this trilogy is that it was only a trilogy. I WANT MORE
