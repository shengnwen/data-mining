I disagree with the people here who criticize this book for being about "buy low, sell high" and investment purposes.  I have a feeling that these people are referring to some of Robert Irwin's other books aimed at real estate moguls in training; however, I took this book as being aimed at people who want to buy the house to actually live in it and to have a home of their own.

I used this book prior to buying my home and took much of the advice to heart.  I interviewed several buyer's agents until I found one I liked and trusted, something that is spoken about in the book clearly.  I also got some great advice from the finance sections that kept me from paying PMI and helped deal with the mortgage broker.

I bought this book for some friends who were looking at buying a house and it helped them when one deal went sour.  I also loaned my copy to two friends shortly before they bought their houses... of course they didn't read it and got screwed on several points (mainly during inspection and negotiation).  Oh well... you can lead a horse to water...

Buy and read this book if you're interested in looking for a house.  It's well worth it
