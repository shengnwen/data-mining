I do not have a degree in psychology, but I am a practicing psychologist. That is, in everyday human interactions I often ask myself, "What is really going on here?  What do you really want from me?  What do I really want from you?"

And no, the answer doesn't always involve sex.

Dr. Berne defines a game as "an ongoing series of complimentary ulterior transactions progressing to a well-defined, predictable outcome."  Much of our behavior, he asserts, is merely games - learned programs (usually from our parents) that are fundamentally dishonest and ultimately designed to get some hidden payoff (which may or may not be good for us). 

After a fascinating theoretical overview (Part I), Berne launches into a "Thesaurus of Games," (Part II) describing the players, moves, and psychological dynamics involved in each.  Though this is the central section of the book (and what prompted me to buy it in the first place), it is NOT my favorite part.  I believe it is the weakest.  I found the inclusion and categorization of games to be arbitrary and limited (Berne concedes that this is just a beginning effort) and most of their descriptions inconsistent and unclear.  

However, the premise of naming the many kinds of subtle maneuvers we execute on each other has great merit (for naming something is the first step toward controlling it), and reading about the games has an intrinsic fascination and entertainment value; you will undoubtedly recognize certain games which you have played yourself or seen others playing.

Part III (Beyond Games), is my favorite part of the book (and not just because it's the shortest).  It is the most optimistic, because it talks about the possibility of transcending our dishonest, programmed existence of game playing and living a free, authentic life.  

Though not always satisfying, in the end Games is a winner.  Play on..
