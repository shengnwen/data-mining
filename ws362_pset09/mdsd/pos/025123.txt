Yes, this is a minor work from a major author of literature, and no, this is not Borges' best, but if anyone wants an encyclopedia of fantastical creatures, especially little-known ones as well as creatures found in modern-day literature, why not get get your information from this fun little book by one of the most influential and highly-revered Latin American writers of our time? All in all, I wouldn't have bought this book if Borges' name wasn't on it, but I wasn't disappointed
