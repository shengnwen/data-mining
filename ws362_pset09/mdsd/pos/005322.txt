Movie reviews are a subjective business.  When looking for a night's entertainment it is not unsafe to give a little less weight to a professional reviewer.  When a person spends all their time seeing movies something ordinary and pleasant may not rank.

When evaluating the greatest of movies however a professional reviewer is the person to read (for basically the same reasons) and Roger Ebert is the professional reviewer most familiar to most Americans.

His judgments in THE GREAT MOVIES II are honest, insightful and unforgiving not only of the material but of himself (read the review of THE BIRTH OF A NATION to see what I mean.)

From THE PRODUCERS, THE LEOPARD , INDIANA JONES , to MY DINNER WITH ANDRE and more his insight fills the volume confirming what you may know about some movies and informing you on other gems you likely never heard of.

I enjoyed this book, I don't know if I'd buy it as my own.  If movies are your thing, I'd say yes.
