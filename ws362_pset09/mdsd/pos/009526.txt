Rude and crude, the author is going for shock value with lots of sex, violence, and four letter words.  Such things do not bother me, so I enjoyed the book for the most part.  The story was good, and the humor had me laughing.  The book was a bit too long, by the end the same old stuff started getting stale for me.

The fictional story was based on Jesus as he was described in the traditional gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  Additionally Jesus travels to the East and learns meditation, Buddism, and kung fu.  I found it to be just basic spiritual concepts, and not to be very inspiring or enlightening.  The goal of the story is humor, the spiritual potential was not realized in my opinion.

Entertainment: 4 stars

To readers that enjoyed this book, I would recommend the movie 'Dogma'
