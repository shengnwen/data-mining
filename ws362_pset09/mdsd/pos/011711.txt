Today is the First Day is a great addition in the First Place series. I first bought my copy in June of 2002 & each devotion was appropriate for the situation I was dealing with. I truly believe God led me to the book to help me make decisions I needed to make. The devotional is written to go along with the First Place study series, but you don't have to do them to use it. Each week starts with a different memory verse, so if you choose, you can memorize 52 verses of Scripture! I highly recommend this book, you will be so blessed
