I am currently an expatriate in France, and have also lived in the United States, Mexico, Spain. Hofstede's book is a good guide to better understand culture.  As with a map, we recognize that it is not (nor is it intended to be reality) rather a tool to help guide us.  The information on cultures in this book is our "first best guess" to understanding business norms in that culture, and then once we get to know the individuals we are working with, we can adapt.  We recognize that these "norms" may change depending on the industry, the region, sub-culture, or other various factors.  This book is extremely helpful in creating our "first best guess.
