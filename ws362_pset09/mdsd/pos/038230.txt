When I bought this book, I was not too sure what to expect. What I got was an excellent read - though not one for the faint of heart! With stories this incredible, they could only be true.

As the title says, it takes you to the underbelly of the cooking world ... the lowest scraping underbellies! We take a trip down memory lane with Chef Bourdain - time spent cooking for Summer jobs; his stint at the CIA; his career and travels following that. These stories have some incredible, quite eye-opening, details that do make you wonder about the wisdom of dining anywhere else but at home. But, they also tempt you to test these details (order fish on Sunday; ask for something well-done while someone else at your table requests the same item medium-rare, etc.).

The massive drug usage is quite disturbing when one thinks that these people are preparing your meal ... how do they survive without putting severed pieces of themselves - or others - in the meal? 

If you have ever been in a commercial kitchen; you will understand the prolific amount of swearing ... too many over-worked people in a small, cramped, damnably hot, space under incredible time constraints. This - and the sex - makes the book a no-no for the young or dainty-minded.

Chef Bourdain's stories have excellent cooking tips, tool tips, etc., which added to the five star recommendation. I gave this book to my Mother (who is 83) and she enjoyed it; the next recipient is my nephew who is in his first year at the CIA ... I do believe he might appreciate this now that he has some of the training under his belt.

Kudos to Chef Bourdain for taking the time to write this book to let the other side see what it is he does ... and does so well
