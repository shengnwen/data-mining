Incredible modern mystery noir!  Characters the you love to hate and hate to love.  A must read for all fans of Michael Connelly, Michael Kordoba, and  Ross MacDonald.  The character of Lee Henry Oswald (you've got to wonder about his parents) lives and breathes on the streets of Dallas.  

Nicely done, a thoroughly enjoyable read introducing me to a darker, more sinister and menacing in which I live.  Nicely done, Harrry Hunsicker has written the best mystery I've read this year
