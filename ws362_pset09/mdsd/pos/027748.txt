If you love 19th-century English literature, but sometimes feel at sea in the terminology of the period, Daniel Pool comes to your rescue with "What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew," a pleasant, sometimes shocking excursion down the Victorian memory lane. Quoting liberally from the works of Austen, Dickens, Trollope et. al., as well as from journalistic and non-fiction dispatches of the period, Pool clues us in on the intricacies of social rank (as vital to the Victorian Englishman as "The Book of Mormon" to the LDS Church), the relative value of money, the etiquette observed and dishes served at a formal dinner, the operations of Parliament, the tortures inflicted on the sick by the medical profession, and the miseries of the workhouse. So much of that society and its basic suppositions are so different from ours that it reminds us of the quote from the novelist L.P. Hartley: "The past is a foreign country. They do things differently there." However, some of the information Pool provides reminds us that the more things change, the more they stay the same. His definition of "Sabbatarians" on page 368 tells us that these were "VERY strict observers of Sunday who tried to close down shops and other `irreligious' activities on the Lord's Day." Discussing the actions of Sabbatarians to save the blasphemous populace from itself, he mentions, "There was also a parliamentary proposal to prevent the poor from using bakehouses to cook hot Sunday meals." In other words, the poor deserved to be punished for their impiety and profligacy in not being able to afford having their own kitchens. The Pharisees were just as rampant then as they were before and after those days, and the Sabbatarians would feel a righteous joy to know that their kind is still thriving in the 21st century
