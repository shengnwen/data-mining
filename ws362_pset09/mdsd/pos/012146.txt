I bought this book for my father for father's day because he is a vinegar fanatic.  I thought it was a book on the top 50 vinegars you could buy, but it isn't that.  It is a book on how to make what the author considers the  best flavored vinegars and oils.  I was sort of disappointed, but after  glancing through the book with my dad we found that the recipes sound  really good.  We are getting excited about trying out a few of the recipes  for our own personal use.  We even think that once we get it under control  we may be able to use them as gifts to friends.  We hope they taste as good  as they sound and look.  Even though it wasn't exacty what I expected it  turned out okay, and the variety of recipes from vanilla oil to fruit  vinegar will keep my dad experimenting for a while
