The Book provides a new dimension in makeup application and techinique.  I've had this book for over year or so, and I find myself referring back to it quite often. It's indeed a indispensible read with stunning photographs and brilliant visuals. Being a novice in makeup application, this book gave me a a whole new insight on the variety of makeup techniques that was used to achieve a certain desired effect; ranging from goth, mod, hollywood glam, all the way to the neutral pallette (for simpletons like myself). Even if one doesn't wear makeup, this book will defintely inspire you to do so
