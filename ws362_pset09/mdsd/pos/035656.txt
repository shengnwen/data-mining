As the title implies, this book tries to answer some difficult questions many Christians and non-Christians people ask about the fate of this world, whether we are really approaching the end of times as prophesied in Revelation or not. It is not a detailed study or explanation of Revelation so this book is not for you if you are looking to understand it (or the old testament end time prophecies).

What this book does is look at the some of the important past-and-present worldwide events and analyze them with Revelation and old testament prophecy books in perspective, and check whether or not these happenings accomplish a specific part of a prophecy. You will have a very interesting (sometime nerve chilling) understanding of some worldwide events, seeing how they accomplish certain biblical passages you never even noticed their importance. Some examples are the world wars, the scattering of the Jews then their regathering and rise of Israel, the current religious conflicts etc...

The authors will show you why they believe our generation have the most reasons to think that the end time is very near (a few generations perhaps away). Yet, they do not set a specific timeline and warn against anyone trying to set a date because the bible specifically warns about that (only the Father knows these dates).  

So this book amounts to adding up evidences showing why we have a lot of reasons to suggest that we are near the end. The book is entertaining and gripping, and will reshape the way you view history, present and future. Recommended!
