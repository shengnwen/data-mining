As a writer, I not only agree fully with Bruce Holland Rogers' assessment of the pitfalls of the trade, but find the essay an honest glimpse into the perils of the publishing market for those who might not understand the process of putting stories and books into print. I couldn't have said it better; I'm now working hard to embrace my inner crank.

As for Part Two: Rogers provides a quick menu of five good, succinct suggestions to prime the creative pump. I've never been one for manuals on writing, but these tools provide both sound advice, and a glimpse into methods the author himself uses to crank out three stories a month for those of us who subscribe to his service (I'd heartily advise this, incidentally: it's cheap, and this is a guy whose short-short fiction is at the very least consistently entertaining, and at its best, a marvel of imaginative thinking).
