Nye's contributions to international politics have a rich legacy - including the introduction of "complex interdependence" (Power and Interdependence, with Robert Keohane) in the 1970s, the optimistic perspective on U.S. prospects in the world (Bound to Lead, 1990) while others wrote Japan as Number One and The Rise and Fall of Great Powers, and the post-September 11 call for multilateralism rather than imperialism (Paradox of American Power, 2002). 
 
"Winning the Peace" (Robert Orr, 2004) requires success in establishing security, governance and political participation, social and economic well-being, and justice and reconciliation.  Nye reminds us that these necessary tasks are more possible with soft power than with diplomatic, economic and military coercion.  To Nye, soft power is the ability to get what you want through attraction, particularly to a country's culture, ideals and policies, rather than through coercion or purchase.  The most effective foreign policy will use "smart power" - the right balance of (hard) command power and (soft) co-optive power.

The discussion illuminates the high cost the United States pays (in Iraq and elsewhere) for relying, by choice or by lack of options, on hard power. Questions for undergrads might include:  (1) why does soft power matter if U.S.'s hard power is so much greater than any other country, (2) when and why did the decline of the U.S.'s soft power really begin, (3) does soft power matter against ideological extremists, (4) can we compare "soft power" in international affairs to domestic elections, (5) is there a relationship between the U.S. loss of soft power and the global spread of democracy since 1974, and (6) what other countries, organizations, etc. have global or wide "soft power"?
