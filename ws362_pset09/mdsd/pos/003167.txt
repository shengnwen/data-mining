"American fiction?"  Not quite, I was there.  In 1984 my girlfriend and I set of from VA to San Francisco CA looking for adventure.  What we found was a world of decadence, violence, deviation, drugs and death that I feel lucky to have escaped alive from.  William interviewed several of my roommates from my Tenderloin apt on Ellis Ave.  Dickie Disgusting (AKA Frank Hutton) was an "Open High" school fiend of mine from "back east" that we hooked up with.  He had gone out there to help start the notorious "SF Skins" that terrorized Height street.  They were immortalized by "Camper Van Beethoven"  when they were spotted bowling in the Height Street Bowling Alley.  Boot Woman was also staying there with us.  I knew Mark Dagger and a whole bunch of the characters in the book (and YES the sheep killing story is real, I have friends that did time over it).  As crazy as the book is, the SF punk life was even more twisted than one can imagine but Vollman did a great job getting into the seedy world that was ours back then and capturing it in ink.  I only hope that there are other survivors like myself back from then, until (or if) I see my old friends again, I can always pick up this book and remember them in their 2os with all their craziness and dysfunction. I will only five it 4 stars maily because it brought back some really painful memories too and I got a little bummed out after reading about the fate of one of the characters. These feelings caused me to have to put the book down for a while. Thank you William, it was a both a pleasure and a gift...
