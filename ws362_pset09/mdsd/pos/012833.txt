I read this book over the course of 2 days where it completly sucked me in.

The story was very complex. The main character, Jacob, discovers that his grandfather had cheated on his pregnant wife (Jacob's grandmother)during WW2 and had a child with her. The grandfather, also named jacob, comes across as a decent person though. No one ever knew this untill Gertruii, the women who had his illegimate child, tells relatives the truth after her husband dies and she is termianlly ill. Both Jacob's grandmother and Gertruii still after all these years mourn the death of his grandfather. 

It is a very emotionally complex story. Jacob discovers things about himself and family that to him are surprising and life changing.

I was able to appreciate the story but I didn't overly enjoy it
