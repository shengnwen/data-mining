I thought this book was well done and fairly comprehensive. The principles are correct and the workouts are good. The techniques demonstrated are very basic, but sound. I would not recommend this book to an advanced practioner of the martial arts since the content would be beneath them. For someone who is new, and even someone who is a little bit farther along then just "new", I would recommend this book.
