An excellent book with good projects.  So far I've only built the armoire, but have others in mind.  I did discover minor discrepancies in the directions.  Cuts did not agree with what pictures showed in the construction.  Trying to find all the different thicknesses of woods specified was difficult if you do not have access to a thickness planer or sander.  There is no problem that can't be overcome with a little ingenuity
