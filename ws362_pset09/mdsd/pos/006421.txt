Chuck Swindoll is one of my favorite writers, though I am not in agreement with all of his theology. But this work on Paul is outstanding.

Before reading this work on Paul, I had read several other volumes on Paul, and Swindoll gave me another perspective on Paul that I have greatly appreciated--the devotional touch to this work. As a pastor, I find this work to be encouraging. Swindoll writes with a pastor's pen. And I love that.

I especially recommend this work to all conscientious pastors
