Very nice companion piece to Miller's original hardback "300," delivered in the same size and format. The book itself is well designed, at times trim and full of white space, and then alternately crammed with amazing images. This can sometimes be frustrating as many of the images deserve a page to themselves. Like the source material, the book can be gruesome, so do not be surprised. A wonderful document of the struggle by director Zack Snyder and his people to be faithful to Miller's award-winning book. As anyone who has worked with blue/green screens knows, it is not lazy man's work
