Napoleon Hill's gift to each of us who reads and rereads this astounding life recipe is priceless. I remain in awe of his rigour, insight and persistence. If you haven't read this book, buy it now, read it and read it again. Then do Hill's exercises exactly as he advises and the world will shift beneath your feet.
