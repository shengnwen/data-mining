This book is about a little girl who was abused and mistreated by the many adults in her life. She came to God as a child and grew in Him despite the  horrible rejection that she faced as a child. She became a missionary and suffered even more but it was for the cause of Christ this time. After her missionary life abroad,she came to America with her husband and children and gave talks dealing with her life as a child and a missionary. This book was introduced to me as a child and  I have read it  many times afterwards. God called me to be a missionary through her writings and the missionary works of others. I too felt that I was a girl nobody loved but God showed me something different-our sufferings are not in vain and that our prayers don't go unanswered
