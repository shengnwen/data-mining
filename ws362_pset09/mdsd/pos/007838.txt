Both of my children adored this book, and I recently bought it for a great niece.  The illustrations are detailed, fascinating and very lovely.  The simple narrative unites the book and makes it more interesting than many alphabet books.  One thing I especially appreciated is that the final illustration showing the main character leaving Market Street after shopping at every booth really *does* have one of all 26 items in it. Children notice things like that and mine were very happy that they could work through that last picture and find everything from A to Z in it
