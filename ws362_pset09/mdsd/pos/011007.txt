A great book.  I found it on the internet - book not available in the UK - and from being unable to walk with the back pain, I was fine within a few days of reading it.  That was 6 years ago. I've been fine since.

If I ever have a twinge, I leaf through the book and am fine in no time.  The idea might seem whacky - but the concept is well explained - and it worked for me.

So really if you have spinal pain, it is well worth a read
