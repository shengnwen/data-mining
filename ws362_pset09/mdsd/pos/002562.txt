Outstanding!  Easy to read and full of valuable information on how your pet (or other animal) actually thinks and sees the world around it.  It is also full of valuable, real-world examples of how to handle this and also full of valuable insight into people and how we think.  Temple Grandin, the author, is autistic (although relatively high-level functioning) and she sees the world differently than you and I see it.  She also believes that is how animals see the world.  I don't agree with the extremes she believes, but I think she is on to something and there is a lot to be learned from her.  She certainly has plenty of examples of instances where her point of view produced the results the animal handlers were looking for in any case.

It is also interesting from a self-examination point of view.  For instance, I am definitely a very visual person as Temple would say .  By page 26 I was very hooked.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.  It is easy to read, and full of interesting insight about people and animals
