I wasnt really into Sci Fi books until my co worker at  my job recommended  clans of the alphane moon. Another Dick Novel. Ive read three of his novels and this is the best so far. Couldnt keep it down. Its a trip how he incorporates  religion, the future and his ever so clever  twists and turns. this book is weird at first but its totally worth buying,or checking out at your local library.

LONG LIVE PD
