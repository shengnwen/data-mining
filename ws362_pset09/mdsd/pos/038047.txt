I can't tell you how this book touched my spirit.  "How might (my) life have been different," if I had read this book when I was young and not 52 years.  Better yet, how different it might have been if my own mother had read this book, or one like it, when I was young!  I have recommended it to every woman who will listen, regardless of age.  It is an oh, so gentle, yet oh, so powerful call to reconnect with ourselves and other women for common experience.  It is NOT a man bashing book, quite the contrary, it merely calls for natural balance to be restored in our world.  If you are a single father of a daughter, I recommend you read this book as a way of guiding your child...read it while she is young for future reference guidance.  Mother's, it is not too late for you to learn from this book, and for you to guide your own daughters with it's wisdom
