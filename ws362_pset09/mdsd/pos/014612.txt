Anderson's book is a great narrative account of that most legendary of decades, the Sixties.  He does a good job of identifying the various strands that made up Sixties culture, strands which are often lumped  together by people today who have but a hazy notion of what really went on.   The book is full of great anecdotes and supported by loads of primary  sources.  Read this book and check to see if this is how you remember it
