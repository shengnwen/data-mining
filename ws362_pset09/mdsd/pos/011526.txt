There is much to learn in this useful book for piano fans and students.  I was a bit disappointed though that prominent pianists were given little coverage or not updated at all - Thibaudet, Andsnes, Hough, Lortie, Perahia - and pianists who are largely unknown to the public were updated, and highly praised.  This was puzzling to me.  I understand wanting to celebrate the careers of lesser known pianists, but why not also cover the careers of those who are performing at Carnegie Hall before the public?  I get the feeling that many of these biographical entries are not for the benefit of the reader, but for the pianists who are listed.  Yet the ordinary reader is the book's customer.  Surely we are worth a little regard.  More useful to the reader is the piano literature section of Part II.  There is a lot of interesting updating here, including Beethoven, Busoni, Godowsky, Medtner, and much more. The list of recommended recordings is helpfully expanded. But there is too much in Part I that seems like excess, and minor careers are overpraised
