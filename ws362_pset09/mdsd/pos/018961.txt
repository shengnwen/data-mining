Prior to pregnancy and having my 6 month old daughter, I was a regular practicer of yoga. I was used to going to intense heated power yoga classes and because of time was looking for something intense yet doable with my unpredictable schedule. This was exactly what I was looking for -the yoga practice is intense yet invigorating. The CDs are perfect and so much better than trying to watch a TV screen. It allows you to get more into your practice as if you were in a class.  The 20 minute programs have been my favorite and no matter what kind of day you have had you can fit 20 minutes into your day. For me it has been the perfect thing to do right before bed.  Baron's voice is slightly annoying but you quickly forget and then don't notice it. The 75 minute CD is good and thorough like a normal class. I would recommend you are familiar with the poses and their names prior to getting so you don't even have to bother with the cards but just jump into practicing. I would highly recommend this product to people familiar with yoga and looking to practice at home.
