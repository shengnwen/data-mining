Nothing wrong with this edition.  Just thought that people might want to know that there is another translation out there that is easier to read AND more fun.  It's the translation in blank verse published in unabridged and unexpurgated form by Meridian (0452010837), and edited by Charles W. Dunn, one of the finest modernizations of a medieval classic ever published. The translation was the life's work of Professor Harry W. Robbins.
