I thought I was going give this a bad rating because I hated Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw so much that I couldn't bear to read any more, but that's the reason why I gave it high marks!  It's been awhile since a novel has brought out such feelings in me!  Frankly, Cathy and Heathcliff deserved one another; I hated Cathy because she was so selfish she did not deserve to be loved by anyone with a good heart, like Edgar; I hated Heathcliff because he was such a monster with no heart towards anyone else other than Cathy.  I was sick to my stomach the way he punished those around him.  I don't know why Heathcliff was so fond of Cathy either.  There was nothing about her to love!  I loved Missus Dean though.  She had the strongest spirit and I found her a refreshing character amidst the madness of all the others.  This book was incredibly tragic and even hard to get through because it is such a downer.  It's like when you think it couldn't get worse, it does!  I didn't give the book 5 stars, however, because I found the ending weak and abrupt.  Other than that, a worthwhile read!
