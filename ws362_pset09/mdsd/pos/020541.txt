In the 80/20 Principle, Richard Koch has captured one of the most important secrets to success in business and individually. He takes an age-old principle and applies it in very practical ways. In my management consulting practice I use this principle more than any other concept. In my work with Chief Executives and Presidents I find that putting this principle in practice has been revolutionary in their business success.   

The basic principles of 80/20 thinking are:
* A few things are always much more important than most things, so spend your valuable time and effort on the vital few.
* Progress means moving resources from low-value to high-value uses.
* The best people - meaning the people best fitted to what they are doing and doing the things that make the most money - generate enormous disproportionate value. 
* Margins - between value and cost, between effort and reward - are always highly variable.
* Resources are always misallocated by giving too many resources to low-margin activities and too few to high-margin activities. 
* Success is under recognized, under celebrated, underrated, undervalued, and under exploited. 
* Equilibrium is illusory. Nothing is ever in equilibrium. Innovation is the only constant. 
* The biggest wins all start from something which is small.

Along with Koch's second book, The 80/20 Individual, he has given every business executive a gift that can be used over and over again. Probably 20% of the books you read give you 80% of the benefit, so make this one of them.
