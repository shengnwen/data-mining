This is one of those books that is quite simple on the first read, but reveals a much deeper level of insight as you begin to apply the principles.  Mindfulness as a concept is difficult for westerners who have been taught to rationalize everything, but it is an essential skill for seeing things as they truly are.  Gunaratana gives the reader a step-by-step system for learning the basics, and introduces Buddhist concepts gently, in a non confrontational way.  He is not saying that Vipissana meditation is the only way to experience the world, but that it is one way.  

This book has changed the way I look at the world, and given me tools to understand what I am experiencing.  An incredible value and an incredible book
