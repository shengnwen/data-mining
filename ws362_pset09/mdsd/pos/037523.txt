The review under mine is ridiculous.  This person obviously knows nothing about Tennessee Williams.  And incidentally, I have no interest in his email address which he egomaniacally implies one should look for.  The characters in this play are not hysterical (except Shannon once when he goes off the deep end, and that's not hysteria come to think of it).  This is a beautiful, moving, perceptive and exceptional play.  I won't give away the plot in case anyone wants to read it.  Williams wrote lots of good and some great plays.  This is a great one.  I came upon this review (and the one under it which is just inaccurate, the reviewer apparently has a hard time grasping what he reads, if he read it) because I just saw the movie of this play and want to reread it again.  I've read it many times, and I love it.  I think (though I'm not sure) that Bette Davis played Maxine in the original production, and unlike Ava Gardner's (who was perfect in the part), her "Ha!" was (as is described in the stage directions) an explosion, and occurred frequently.  One scene I will give away.  Shannon tells Hannah about a place where the animals go to deficate.  The place is so poor and the people are so hungry, that the people go through the dung looking for and eating bits of undigested food.  Hannah goes behind a tree and throws up.  That was left out of the movie.  This is a very kind and gentle play.  And emotionally (all the Williams' plays I've read are, he used to be a hero of mine, I've outgrown him, except for this gem) and intellectually (not so customary) deep.  (That word "deep" will I hope turn you on, not off.)  Oh.  My email address isn't listed
