Thirty or forty years in the future, people will look back at Resource Wars by Michael Klare as one of those books they wished they had read, or as one that policymakers should have read.

Klare takes a serious look at the types of potential conflicts that will emerge as a result of increasing population and decreasing natural resouces. Many would cover oil exlusively (and Klare has written on oil alone), but this book was refreshing because it also looked at resources such as lumber, and water.  The book covers a wide range of topics in a very practical, matter-of-fact fashion.  This is not a polemical book and that is refreshing.

Resource Wars could almost be compared to Huntington's Clash of Civilizations in the way that each author is making a prediction about future conflicts.  While Huntington's thesis is interesting, Klare's seems more likely.

Highly recommended
