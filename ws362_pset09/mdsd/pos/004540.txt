The Golden Isles of Georgia are mysterious and fascinating.  The Spanish moss, tabby walls, the &quot;shout&quot; of the Sea Island Singers, and cloudy past reach out to visitors today.  The author of this book, a salt-water Geechee, grew up on Sapelo.  Her story is wonderfully interesting.  The beliefs of the slaves' descendants were so little changed for so many years.  Traditions born in western Africa are still hanging on to life even today on Sapelo.  I hope the government, even in the name of saving the environment, never succeeds in taking the land away from the Geechee families who lived such true lives there.  Their life deserves to continue as long as their faith lives
