For my money, this is Iris Murdoch's best novel. Many of her recurring motifs are here: an interest in Buddhism and other things mystical, swimming, homosexuality, lots of food and drink, a love affair, deep and unfathomable matters of philosophy. But this is perhaps where she gets the mix right, or more right than anywhere else. The central love affair is compelling and moving, though perhaps a little far-fetched. The main male character is very amusing. The setting, though, is perhaps the joy of the book: a rugged seaside spot in the North of England where the sea is a churning blue-green cauldron, freezing cold and dangerous. Only the Brits would delight in bathing in such a place, as the characters do here. But of course they are right. Dame Iris loved such swimming holes. And they are exhilarating places. Not little chlorinated Californian puddles of warmth. The real sea. The Sea, The Sea. Great fun
