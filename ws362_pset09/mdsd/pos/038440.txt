Hi..

When I was interning at Maxim, my supervisor introuced me to this book. I liked it it so much, that I immediately bought one for myself.
This is an awesome book. My supervisor said, that no other book has been written on this subject with so much detail. It almost covers every aspect of test engineering. 
It is extremely easy to understand too. So, it is not a problem whether you are an expert or just a beginner. 
I recomment this book to everyone who believe in KNOWING IT ALL
