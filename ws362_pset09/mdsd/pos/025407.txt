6 25 06 I did The Detox Box program about 60 days ago and wanted to let a little time pass before I commented--.   I loved it!!!
I went with all of Dr. Hyman's suggested `favorite' supplements.
Yes, it was expensive and some what time consuming, but I feel it was so very worth it.
It helped me kick the intense sugar, white flour and caffeine addictions that had hold of me. This is extremely miraculous for me and I am so very thankful to God I found this program. 
Here are some of sources (showing costs) that I used. - Once I made the decision to do the detox I was in a rush to get all these things in fast and in some cases I paid more in shipping charges as a result.

I even had to get a blender (our other one bit the dust a few years ago) but it is a good thing I did because since the detox I have kept up with the morning shake several times a week. On the detox the hardest part, but doable, was getting down the Bentonite Clay and the Psyllium. I did the program pretty close to prescribed and have since kept up with eating more Brown Rice, Fish, Veggies and with drinking more water and Herbal Teas.
I think giving up that morning coffee was really helpful for me both with controlling my evening sugar cravings and improving my joint pain. Lost about 10 lbs so far and plan on losing more - really feeling more energy and joy. 
Check Amazon.com for all the `program' products as well. I really appreciate Amazon and the users who wrote reviews on this product.  I hope I can encourage someone to try The Detox Box. Hopefully you will share my success with it. I have about 100 self help health books (including Mark Hyman's other books) and so far this one has been the catalyst to give the others possibility! 
Do it!
