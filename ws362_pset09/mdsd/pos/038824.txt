In this book, a seven year old boy tells different stories about his life and troubles.  Though the book suffers from ending a bit abruptly, the stories are pleasant reading.  This book contains a loving family that is both realistic and great reading.  I especially enjoyed the suburban setting.  I thought the first person narrative worked especially well too.  The book reminded me a little of other "boys growing up" tales, like the "Soup" books or even Tom Sawyer.  Two thumbs up
