I can see how most readers would find it boring throughout the book...but I'm usually one to quit reading books halfway through if they're really THAT bad.  But...this book has a surprise waiting at the end that's worth all of that and more.  I gasped at the surprise and my fiance looked at me like...what in the world are you going off about!  I loved it...I truly did and I just can't get over how incredibly romantic the young author, Nicolas Sparks really is.  I mean...you'd swear he's gay!  Straight men just simply aren't that naturally and creativly romantic!  I'm a fan for life!  His wife is a lucky woman if he's anything like the men in his novels
