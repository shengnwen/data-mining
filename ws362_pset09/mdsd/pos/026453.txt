As a high school teacher working with many Christian students, this has been an excellent resource to prep my students for the realities of campus life.  I am so thankful for examples like Abby Nye who confront real issues like tolerance, indoctrination, and the politically correct.  It's refreshing when there's so much apathy in the classroom.  I also appreciate the fact that Abby acknowledges the fear of being different, but she tackles this fear head-on through confidence in Christ.  This book has been so helpful that I've recommended it both to my students and in my own book, JumpStart Your Future: A Guide for the College-Bound Christian.
