This novel, written by Merce Rodoreda during her exile from Spain and well after the Spanish Civil War, describes the life of a woman who grows from young adulthood through middle age during political upheaval. She could have described war, or poverty, or death, or fear, and appealed solely to sentiment but she does not. This novel is rich and complex, appealing to both sense and sensation. Her protagonist, Quimet, is usually sympathetic but sometimes not, as most human beings are. 

While the Spanish Civil War is the setting for this novel, Rodoreda writes outside the lines and makes a book which describes this specific place and anyplace. To give context to other reviewers' displeasure with the translated title of La Placa del Diamante, Franco forbid Catalans, the residents of Barcelona and Merce Rodoreda among them, to speak their own language. Language is primary to Catalans and Rodoreda was a Catalan writer despite Franco.

Rodoreda writes tangible descritions of poverty and unhappiness, sliding back and forth from the concrete outside world and the narrator's sometimes dreamy interior world. The shifts in description themselves describe how Quimet's consciousness is altered by poverty, by hunger, by death and by redemption. 

This is an excellent and thoughtful novel, and a pleasure to read
