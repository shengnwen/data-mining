If people read the author's bio and see that he founded a large (mega) church in Ohio using the principles and practices from this book, they might think of this book as a "How-To" on having a big church. I think that really misses the point of what is being offered here.

Reading Conspiracy of Kindness was like being enrolled in Christianity 101. At one point the author comments about a bumpersticker Billy Graham once made mention of. The sticker read, "Jesus Yes, Church No." Although that slogan was popularized during the Vietnam era, I think it probably summarizes the feelings of much of America today. I wish there were some way to put this book into the hands of every single Church leader. This concept of "Low Risk, High Grace" evangelism is exactly what our society needs. Not more preachers; more servants!

Again, you don't want to get the impression that this book is about how to get people to go to your church. Toward the end of the book the author answers the question of, "Aren't you really doing all of this stuff to draw attention to your own church?" The answer is, "No." He says, "We aren't giving of ourselves to get anything. Even if we stopped growing altogether, we would continue to serve just as consistently" (pg. 148).

That's the key! If you're looking for a "magic bullet" to grow your church or promote your own agenda, this book won't be for you. If you're looking to get in touch with the Jesus who lives within you and is passionate about getting out and touching people, there is no better place to meet Him and set Him free than the Biblical wisdom of Conspiracy of Kindness
