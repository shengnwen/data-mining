An intellectually stimulating and enlightening work discussing interplay between some of Psychology and Theology's greatest minds.  Most appealing is Meissner's presentation of the relationship between Dr. Sigmund Freud  and protestant minister Oskar Pfister. Focusing on their shared common goal  of &quot;healing souls,&quot; Meissner illustrates their friendship without  compromising the power of their intellectual debate. Further, a thourough  discussion of the issues in Freud's &quot;Future of an Illusion&quot;, and  Meissner's lesser known rebuttal, &quot;Illusion of the Future&quot;  enlightens the reader concerning the relevance of religion in the pursuit  of a healthy soul in the midst of a failing civilization. A significant  read for psychologists, theologians or anyone interested in meshing the two  disciplines
