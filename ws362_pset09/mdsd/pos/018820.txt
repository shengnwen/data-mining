The editors present a collection of essays that analyse legislatives across Latin America. The essays let you compare across countries the performances of these parliaments and their interactions with the rest of their governments. The book studies what are arguably the four main countries - Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico.

It should be said that the inter-country comparisons mostly have to be done by you. Each chapter is written by a different author, and focuses on a particular country. Within the chapters, perhaps due to space constraints, there is relatively little comparison with situations in other countries
