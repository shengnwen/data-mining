This is a wonderful book on America's greatest living painter.  I have alway loved Andrew Wyeth's art, it so singular to him, totally unique.  You can tell he was influenced by Whistler, but his work is his own.  This book has vivid images of Wyeth's best work and the text is highly informative.  I was thrilled when I saw this book, it is the best I have seen on Wyeth's vast catalog of paintings.  Wyeth is truly an American Master, thank you Ms. Knutson for a job well done.
