This lexicon is invaluable for doing Greek word studies.  

As a layman struggling to teach myself Greek, I find it a great place from which to launch my Greek word studies.  It contains more than 15,000 references to classical, intertestamental, early Christian and modern literature.

This edition contains more elaborate definitions of Greek terms than other lexicons I have seen.  The benefit of these, to me, is that it helps give me a fuller sense of the word being studied and helps me to avoid anachronisms.

There is no doubt in my mind that this is the lexicon for serious Greek students.
