This set contains many essential pre-romanticism texts that most college British literature classes cover.  It includes many valuable works, including the full text of Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf, The Canterbury Tales, excerpts from The Book of Margery Kempe, Utopia, Donne's Holy Sonnets, Astrophil & Stella, King Lear, Gulliver's Travels and much, much more.  The printing is beautiful and the binding is very high quality.  I bought this book for college and, as a teacher and grad student I have come back to it many times for material or just for enjoyable reading
