This 1993 compilation collects about 361 Far Side illustrations.  I found this collection to be a bit less riotous than some others of Larson's collections, and in many cases I had to think more to understand the joke.

For example, there is an illustration showing workers in a chicken processing factory.  It took me a moment to realize that there was a basket on the wall with a "GIZZARDS" bucket below the basket.  There is another illustration of the famous "Larry of the Lemurs," who was significantly less famous than his African counterpart, Tarzan.

I also thought there were a number of illustrations that were very funny.  Adam calls Eve to ask her out on a date and the first thing she thinks is that she doesn't have a thing to wear.  Another good one is the lady walking through the sinister woods with a vacuum cleaner and the caution that nature abhors a vacuum.

A few illustrations failed to tickle my funny bone.  The image showing a dog hallucinating about cat mirages went no where with me.  Another one about shortening Dodge Ball City to Dodge City after the arrival of the Earp brothers fell flat for me as well.

Gary Larson always offers an "outside the box" view of the world.  Often his images offer a new twist on a clich, either reinterpreting the clich with an image, such as two robots sitting side-by-side, noting that each knew how to push the other's buttons.  Sometimes Larson changes one word to achieve a new variation on an old phrase, such as when Jeannie Jeannie Eatszuchinni testifies against her brother, Mr. Pumpkineater.  Regardless of how well each image or caption works, you can be assured that this book will stretch your mental muscles, and perhaps you will be able to look at the world in different and more humorous way.
