Dr Seuss books have done it again.  In this magical adventure you get to learn about all kids of sea creatures and the different levels of the ocean.  It is a must have for anyone who has children tha love Marine Life.   My daughter has this book memorized from cover to cover and it is so  factual.  I highly recommend this book to any parent or educator. Not only  is it fun, but very educational.  I learned a lot also
