Maggie and her husband Ira are going to the funeral of the husband of Maggie's childhood friend, Serena.  As they travel, their opposite personalities are revealed.  Maggie is a well-meaning "fixer" of situations and people, whose plans often go awry.  Ira is a much more reticent person, who is constantly frustrated by what he sees as his wife's interference in the lives of others.  The funeral they attend is a reunion of many of their old friends and they soon discover that Serena is attempting to recreate her wedding at the ceremony.  When that is behind them they head for home and on the way they have an encounter with an elderly black man.  Their last stop is at the home of Fiona, their former daughter-in-law where, in true Maggie fashion, she tries to patch up Fiona's marriage with their son.  This is a difficult book to rate, because it all seems so hopeless and unchanging.  However, the accurate insights into marriage, relationships, and life are definitely above average, which is why I gave it 4 stars.
