I found this book helpful studying for boards.  It is a very large field to cover and the author stresses board relevant material with an "open book" icon next to them.
Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't think $150 is a bargain for a soft cover book.  I would try to buy one used or get one from a graduated resident.  Once you pass your boards you probably will never use this book.
I don't know what the previous reviewer means by a "real board review course" for orals.  It would be better to have a study group and learn actively by going over topics orally rather than sitting through lectures and learning passively
