This book is &quot;A&quot; number 1!  I have hundreds of cookbooks and feel that if you get one good recipe out of a cookbook you made a good purchase!  Mesa Mexicana is wonderful because the recipes are authentic,  easy to find ingredients,  and the end result is fabulous!  I've tried  several and have made each again.  If your a carnitas lover, try their  recipe.  The lard will frighten you, but in the end will delight you!  On  to the tamales
