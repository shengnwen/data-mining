This book is an excellent  read for any artist (literary, visual, peforming, or otherwise), particularly those who are just beginning as much of the material may seem less than revolutionary to the "educated" artist. Richards' language is generally clear, and careful reading elucidates even the most convoluted of his passages. Overall an interesting book aside from a few chapters Richards spends chasing his own tail in an attempt to reconcile morality with desire
