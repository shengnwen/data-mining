Let me first say that I love Jean Rabe's work..I know many people think her characters are to powerful and behave inhumanly and unrealistic,but these are fantasy characters,not real people.. One thing you must do when you decide to read any of her novels is try not to compare the characters to real life people..If you do that,then none of her books are for you..Matter of fact,reading fantasy DL or FR novels aren't for you...  

 Anyway,I loved all of the main characters in this novel,especially my favorite character of all,Dhamon.. Ragh was also pretty cool and some senes had me dying laughing.. I kinda felt bad for the Draco..For a Draconian,Ragh had a high sense of honor which I liked..The best part was of the story was Dhamon being reaquainted with Feril..It would have been nice If the 4 book quest ended differently,but the series was great nonetheless..
  I hope Rabe writes moer about Ragh and Feril..I've really come to enjoy Ragh's character,and I liked Feril from the New Age trilogy...  If you haven't yet read these books,you definitely should go out and get it..
