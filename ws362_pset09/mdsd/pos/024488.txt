This is the "one" book that I recommend to people that can handle it. Hands down, it revolves in my "quite fluid" Top 5 books of all time list (as if I would rank such things! scoff!). 

If you've went this far...just read it. Robbins rocks, and Switters rocks, even more. I really can't explain this book, just read it! It's worth it. It can be life changing (or at least life perspective changing) and even more importantly, it's fun for the whole ride
