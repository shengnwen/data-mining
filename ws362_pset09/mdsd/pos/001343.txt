Although this book takes place in three disparate historical periods, I did not find it difficult to follow at all. To the contrary, it evokes a three-part harmony not dissimilar to that found in Michael Cunningham's The Hours, to which this book bears some resemblance.

Pears' theme is the effort to preserve civilization in the face of the onslaught of barbarism. Whether one finds oneself in the late Roman period, the medieval world, or Nazi-occupied France, the challenge is to identify the values that represent humanity at its best and to hold on to them. This is not an easy task for any of Pears' heroes, who are all deeply human and flawed. 

This is an extraordinary novel. Those looking for a "Name of the Rose" mystery will not find it, but those looking for a challenging book that asks the basic questions about civilization and human nature will be well rewarded
