Once you read Norman Grubb's classic work on the unknown intercessor, Rees Howells, you will fall on your face and cry in repentance for your prayerlessness (1 Samuel 12:23).  That is what I did!  This book is one of the most convicting works on prayer and yet it is the story of a man of prayer, Rees Howells.  I have never heard of a man of prayer like Howells.  How we need a man like him again!

The book flows easily together and when you are done you get a true sense that while Howells was altogether human, he was also a man of passion for the Lord.  Howells was willing to obey Jesus no matter what.  He sought God earnestly and God answered his prayers in very powerful, biblical ways.  

Buy this book and recommend it to your friends.  If they love Jesus, they will be convicted.  I promise
