Dr. Weil is the one health authority I trust completely, without question.  He is a regular contributor to Prevention Magazine and knows more about nutrition and health than anyone on the planet.  I get the feeling, while reading his books, this man writes to give information, not to make money.  He does have a line of supplements but ALL proceeds from sales go directly to supporting the growth of integrative medicine.  His "Eating Well for Optimum Health: The Essential Guide to Food, Diet, and Nutrition  "  is full of  practical advice and his reasons for giving it are sound and logical.  You won't find the desired quick fixes here, no miracle cures or empty promises.  Dr. Weil is one man who lives by the adage, "You are what you eat" and he does a fine job of passing along all the information to help you make more educated choices and less excuses.  Dr. Weil emphasizes diet as an "important influence on health" and this book gives you the basic principals of eating well.   What some people might dislike about  "Eating Well for Optimum Health" is how it puts the responsibility for your  health squarely on your own shoulders.  I recommend anything by Dr. Andrew Weil if you're really looking to take charge of your health and are willing to make the necessary changes.  EXCELLENT!!
