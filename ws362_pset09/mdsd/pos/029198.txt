finally! found here: what my gyn didn't have enough time to explain, what i didn't understand in medical journals, what friends didn't know or care about. found here: a relevant history tracing back to the 1930's and a clear understanding of the impact of "medicalization." and all in ms. seaman's confidence-inspiring voice (examples: "basically the stallions kicked over the collection buckets" and "don't worry, the research is easier to understand than the title"). plus, thankfully, ms. seaman touches on what i know is imperative even today: amending permission forms/risk releases before going into (any type of) surgery. cheers! here's to accepting responsibility and making informed decisions
