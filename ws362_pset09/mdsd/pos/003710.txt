Reading New Spring was my first adventure in the Wheel of Time Series.  It served the purpose well of an introductory book to a longer story.  Jordan creates quite a realm of magic, history, mystery, and kingdoms.  The strong point of the book is the character development of the two main characters---this interaction between Moraine and Siuan makes the book worthwhile if nothing else does.

New Spring references many past conflicts between forces apparently on sides of good and evil but they are only referenced and not explained.  Little is explained in this book...I can only assume the questions will be answered in future books of the series.

The first chapter of the book focuses on a Warrior-King w/o a kingdom named Lan.  Then, begining with the second chapter until very late in the book, we do not see him again, and Jordan focuses on other characters and scenes, so that when he does return to Lan, I had forgot most of the information about him.  

The writing in the book is excellent but sometimes long on descriptions and minituae and short on action.  I am somewhat leery to get too much into this series for fear some of the later books will be stuffed with filler instead of action or instead of wrapping up the entire series. I also wonder if the questions I had in this book are ever answered in future books in the series.

The book does stand on its own, as well as create an interest in continuing in the series---something I hope not to regret
