 this book really has it all. I bought this book after reading previous reviews and I was not disappointed. It takes you through all of the silkscreening approaches from begining to end. It also gives you loads of resources for shirts and supplies. It gives alot of advice from the business end as well. My book also came with a helpful DVD. Of all the books that i've seen for sale on this subject, I think this is probably your best choice.
