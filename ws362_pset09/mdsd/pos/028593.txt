"Forensic Files of Batman" truly is an entertaining read.  People often forget about Batman's intelligence, overfocusing on the action elements of the Dark Knight genre.  While some readers and reviewers are nitpicking on little details (e.g. Commissioner Gordon still working, no mention of Robin, etc.), this book is meant for all, not just diehard fans.  If you like good detective short stories or are a general Batman fan, this book is for you.
