~North Against South: The American Iliad 1848-1877~ is provocative account of the road to disunion, the late War Between the States, and the short-lived Confederacy which was militarily extirpated in 1865. Ludwell Johnson presents basic objective historical facts from the beginning of the sectional crisis that afflicted antebellum America. The problem is that what passes for objectivity these days is biased scholarship. While it is admitted that a pro-Unionist could feasibly write an objective account, many spend their time obfuscating historical fact, rationalizing atrocities and downplaying abuses committed by the Lincoln regime. Johnson levels the playing field and presents information that other historians deny or gloss over. He offers an insightful social and political history from the sectionalism crisis that emerged in antebellum America to the post-Reconstruction era.  Moreover, Johnson gives clarity to the various issues at stake, such as: the spread of slavery to the territories; federal funding for internal improvements; and exorbitant protectionist tariffs lobbied for by northern industrialists.  This is not a military history per se, but a handy succinct companion volume covering a pivotal juncture in American history-the sectional crisis, the War Between the States, and Reconstruction. Yes, this is a perspective that would appeal to Southern partisans-because it doesn't obfuscate historical fact and as Clyde Wilson says, it "redeemed the honor of the Confederacy."  John Mering, former Professor Emeritus of History at University of Arizona has called this "...the southern version..."  Historians Clyde N. Wilson and James I. Robertson have also lavished praise on Johnson's book as well. 
 
Ludwell Johnson is Professor Emeritus of History at the College of William and Mary and a specialist on the War Between the States and Reconstruction era.
