Richard Lovett does a good job of describing, in a general way, the three basic modes of bicycle touring: vehicle-supported, &quot;credit-card&quot; (i.e., inn-to-inn), and loaded (camping).  It's rare to find *any* books on touring, so on that basis, the book is great.  And if you've never toured before, this is a good, informative book.  However, if, like myself, you're looking for in-depth hints and kinks on loaded touring, you won't find them here.  Ergo, four stars for this one
