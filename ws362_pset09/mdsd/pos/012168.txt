I read Misery Guts,by:Morris Gleitzman. In Misery Guts I liked some parts and disliked others.For example Keiths discription of London is pretty funny. Oh by the way the story takes place in London. One reason I disliked this story is because it has some words that are hard to understand,like mum and sette.Another reason I liked this story is because,It was interesting. You might have a hard time reading this story if your eight or below. I reccomend this book to older readers with more experience because of the hard words. But if you are looking for a story you don't read every day, I reccomend this book
