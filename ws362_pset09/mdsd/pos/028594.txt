SKELLIG is highly original and beautifully written.  The characters of Michael and Mina as well as their parents are well drawn and fully realized and I feel the book would appeal equally to girls and boys. The book is neither pure fantasy or realistic fiction but a unique and lyrically crafted blend.  Michael's school life and Mina's home schooled life are nicely contrasted and though the book is set in England and has that definite British feel it is not confusing to the American reader.   The book makes sense in the context of the fantasy character (Skellig) it creates and has a satisfying conclusion even though we never get a total understanding of who or what Skellig is though Almond gives us tantalizing hints.  Too much explanation would have taken away some of the magic and grace of the story.
