From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones.  Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story.  Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story.  It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane.  By the end I felt I knew her.  

The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault.  There are many places in the book that could have been shortened.  I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.  

It is a lovely story.  I recommend it if you hunger for a love story.  It is lengthy, so some patience is needed at times, but it is well worth it.
