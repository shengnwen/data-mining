Couldn't put this one down once I started reading it.  Detailed without becoming tedious, and with extracts from letters by the people who actually fought the war.  If you have always wondered how it was won and why, and where it was fought, this is the book you want to read.  Covers the important battles in the North, and even better, the battles in the South.  This is good stuff, read it and enjoy
