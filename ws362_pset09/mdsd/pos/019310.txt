I can't really say much more that what has already been said.

I feel this is a great resource for those who are eager to know almost a history of serial killing.  So many people only know a few names (i.e. Jack the Ripper, Ed Gein, Ted Bundy).  This book takes you back to show that Serial Killers are not a new phenomenon.  It introduces you to serial killers not only from the past but also from different regions.  

I found this book to be one which encouraged me to learn more and more about those killers who are not as well know.  Overall, a great book and very informative
