Being a physicist I frequently get bored with &quot;science for the layman&quot; books (for instance, Hawking's &quot;Brief History of Time&quot;). This was not the case with Stewart's &quot;Dice&quot; book. It is very well researched and written, in a style that wisely combines historical information with new discoveries, which are, therefore put into perspective. You can even try your hands in simple calculations with your PC. On the whole, a very balanced exposition, without, thank God!, the usual exageration on the place of chaos in the future of science. A very good place to start
