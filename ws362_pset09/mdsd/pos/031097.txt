Part of my job as an elementary teacher is to help my students understand how important it is to get along with each other.  Matthew and Tilly, by Rebecca C. Jones is the perfect book to kick off a unit on FRIENDSHIP.  The author immediately captures interest by telling about all the fun times that Matthew and Tilly share together, like rescuing a lady's kitten from a tree and selling lemonade.  But, like most good friends, Matthew and Tilly had an argument so bad that they didn't speak to each other for days.  Finally, they both say, &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; and are friends again.  This book is just right for young readers
