Celeste and Sean are a married couple who are complete opposites. She loves fashion and works in the industry, is neat, and trendy, and he abhors being in fashion, is sloppy, eccentric, and is a stay-at-home dad. But somehow they have put aside their differences and seem to have the perfect marriage, or do they? Celeste seems to have opened a can of worms when she accidentally discovers Sean's private journal and reads his unfavorable ramblings on herself and finds that her husband is attracted to another woman. She keeps secretly reading his journal and starts her own counterjournal in rebuttal of Sean's ramblings about the birth of their son, Harry, and the first weeks of parenthood. Will fidelity win against desire and will this young marriage survive its first big test?

**** As a female reader, I thoroughly enjoyed Celeste's written admonishments to Sean's entries and his and her impressions on the events of their marriage where the truth probably lies somewhere in between their one-sided versions. Sean's witty recounts of caring for Harry were very entertaining. I enjoyed Rebecca Campbell's novel on the trials and triumphs of married life and commitment. ****
