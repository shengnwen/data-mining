We have tried four dinner recipes in this book so far, and all were good. I was surprised to see that many dinner recipes are only recipies on how to prepare veggies, and then the end of the recipe it says "Tip: this dish goes well with grilled chicken or beef" etc, so you are left on your own to figure out what meat to serve and how to prepare it. 
However, this cookbook does have a great variety of recipies that don't just use the same old zone veggies.
The baked salmon on fennel and mustard dill sauce recipe was excellent (and soo easy) and left my 6 year old asking for a third helping! 
Beautiful pictures of the finished meal, but I got a kick out of one salad that was pictured with bow tie pasta...which was not in the recipe and is a zone diet no-no
