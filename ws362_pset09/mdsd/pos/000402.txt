I checked this book out from the library and I felt really motivated and started on all my projects, this is the only book I have read on this subject. I was really puzzled by all the negative or so-so reviews from other procrastinators (many who think they are quite clever embedding their procrastation habits into their reviews in a way they think is humorous. It is funny but after the 4th review it gets a little stale). You see, when I understand why I am doing something, I then know I can change it, that possibility alone motivates me. Knaus does bring across many possible solutions for one to try in addition to identifying all the reasons and causes. One cannot change what's in the dark in the dark, so yes, knowing the reasons sheds the light on it you need in order to change it. 

Bottom line : If you REALLY REALLY want to stop procrastinating  in your heart and are fed up with it, and are SERIOUS about changing,  if you learn by understanding intellectually the causes to your problems, this book will help you.  It might not be everyone's learning language, (it's not overly emotionally supportive, there are no charts, it's more mind based) but the author certainly knows his stuff. It's up to you to do the psychological work.

I'm definately going to buy a copy now
