This is THE book I recommend and give to people as an introduction to spiritual life.  
It is just beautiful and powerful.  It is sad some people criticize it and "don't get it".  Anyone who has ever experience being and the witness state can feel that the writer has some real attainment.  
This book is to be experienced to see the deep wisdom and power it has to offer.
