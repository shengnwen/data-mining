Alfred Metraux's study of Haitian vaudou is as comprehensive as one can imagine an outsider can achieve.  The book covers the history, social framework, gods, spirits, and loa, rituals, magic, and what The Church thinks.  There are antecdotal stories that illustrate the powers and beliefs of vaudou practitioners. Metraux's direct observations are ususally imparted without condescension.  I found the writing to be scholarly as well as approachable and entertaining.  An excellent resource for those interested in this misunderstood Creole religion
