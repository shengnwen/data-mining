Everything you need to know about Thomas' book is contained in the title. "The Glorious Pursuit" tackles how to pursue growing into the likeness of the glorious image of Christ. Many books in the past decade have confronted the topic of spiritual formation/spiritual disciplines. Some have broached the topic of the virtues. No other book has so biblically and practically addressed both together. Chapter by chapter, virtue by virtue, Thomas, like a master teacher, describes what the virtue is, then details the biblical and historical means to developing those virtues.

"Embracing the Virtues of Christ" empowers readers to develop the spiritual disciplines that lead to the spiritual formation of the following core spiritual virtues: humility, surrender, detachment, love, chastity, generosity, vigilance, patience, discernment, thankfulness, gentleness, fortitude, obedience, and penitence. "The Glorious Pursuit" shows you how you can cooperate with the grace and resurrection power of Christ as He orchestrates the formation of your inner life increasingly into alignment with His inner life.
