"Make Money, Not Excuses: Wake Up, Take Charge, and Overcome Your Financial Fears Forever" is an interesting book in which the writer, Jean Chatzky, not only encourages her target audience to manage their financial responsibilities better, but also provides tips allowing them to become wealthy. There is a significant amount of information here on how to save money while avoiding common pitfalls like unpaid bills and credit card debt. There is also some useful advice on hiring advisors, stock investing, and accumulating savings for retirement. Chatzky even shows readers that one does not necessarily have to be a "great investor" in order to become rich. She outlines the process in four seemingly simple-to-follow steps, a couple of interesting ones include not spending more than one makes, and then investing that which remains. The four steps are designed to assist readers with becoming more wealthy than they were during the previous day
