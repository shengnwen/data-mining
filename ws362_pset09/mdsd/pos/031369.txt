This is a very funny retelling of six popular fairy tales (including Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, and the Three Little Pigs), each of which seriously deviates from the tradition plotline in service to Dahl's wicked sense of humor. There have been many fairy tale parodies in recent years, but this book stands out both because of the irreverence and the fact that each tale is told in rhyme. 

Only someone with Dahl's clout could publish a scene in which a little girl whips out a gun and kills her enemy, and only those who love Dahl will appreciate the dark humor that is his trademark. 

I found that the six stories were fun and entertaining, and I think that they would be better read aloud to children than read silently. 

Over the last fifty years, there has been a trend of removing anything objectionable from fairy tales, and I would remind critics that these stories are more in keeping with the rough and tumble spirit of the original tales by the Grimm brothers and others, than the Disneyfied versions that we find elsewhere.

Judged against other books by Dahl, I have to say that this is not his best children's work, since he is working off of familiar elements that are not entirely of his own creation. Also, the short lengths of the stories, and the imposition of the rhyme scheme might have prevented him from really exercising his imagination to the fullest extent. 

But in my book, Dahl on his worst day is better than most other children's authors on their best day, and any child who likes his more traditional books will enjoy the giggles that these offbeat tales can provide.
