Tony Horwitz has written fascinating book about his experiences traveling to the southern states and learning more about the Civil War through the eyes of a variety of people. 

The Reenactors, who demand perfection in being properly dressed as a Civil War Soldier (otherwise they are Farbs...read the book about FARBS), the students (both black and white) who have far differing opinions of the war, the confederate battle flag, the issue of slavery, etc...and the variety of people who have opinions and beliefs ranging from "slavery caused the Civil War" to the idea that the war was an invasion of the South and an invasion of the culture of the South. 

The book has moments that make you laugh and moments that make you wonder when, if ever, our nation will finally heal itself from the Civil War. The overt racism of some groups and people in the book are disturbing (on both sides of the racial issue), but Horwitz does a good job in trying to balance people who believe the south was wrong versus those who feel the southern soldiers fought because they believed they were fighting for a cause. 

It's a well written book that both teaches you about the Civil War and makes you think about how strong of an impact the war had on our society as people are still "arguing" 141 years later about a war that killed over 600,000 men.
