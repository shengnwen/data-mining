Richard Bessel looks at Nazism from Hitler's rise to the aftermath of the war.  It is fine companion piece to Robert S. Wistrich's book on the Holocaust in this same series, Modern Libary Chronicles.  These two books together will give one a frightening picture of the impact of Nazism, first in Germany and then in the world.  Bessel paints a broad picture and, in as much space as these small format titles allow, goes into the economic and sociological impact of Nazisim, particularly after attaining power in the early 1930s, in addition to the more obvious political impact.  The last chapter is particularly fascinating in showing how Nazism and the German people were separated as concepts in post-war Germany as the focus in memory shifted to the last years of the wars with the Germans as victims.  A tidy, concise, frightening read
