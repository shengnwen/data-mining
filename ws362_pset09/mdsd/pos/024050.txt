When I read this book, I was completely impressed with the author's power to draw you into the scene of the story. I mean, I was seeing mountains and open grass lands and beautiful horses - and I've never seen them in real life. This book is very well-written, and the imagery is powerful and moving. 

The main character, Cole, is chasing after a lifestyle that has passed. A life that is no more. He wants beauty in the world; all he finds is pain and sorrow. And maybe that is the way it is for all of us. We want what he wants, but reality crushes our view that this world can be made perfect if only this could happen...if only that could happen...It cannot. This is one of the most powerful themes in the book: we are all chasing a life that in many ways cannot exist in this world.
