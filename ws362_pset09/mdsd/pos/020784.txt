OK, well maybe read &quot;Moby Dick&quot; too, but if you're going to read just one book by Melville, I suggest this one.  Disregarded in Melville's lifetime, this book could have been written today...except that it  exemplifies the cultural moment that produced it.  Lyrical, magnificent,  prescient, and wonderfully confusing, I'm on a personal mission to  introduce this novel to as many people as possible
