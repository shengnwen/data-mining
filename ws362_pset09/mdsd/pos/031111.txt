I would recommend this book for elementary classroom teachers.  It  provides outstanding projects and ideas for integrating Art into Language Arts.  The author does and excellent job of teaching the elements of art and principles of design in the art projects!  I am an Art Teacher and have taught many of the projects in the book.  All projects were successful
