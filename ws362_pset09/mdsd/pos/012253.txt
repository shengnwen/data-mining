I picked this up on a business trip; I haven't been able to put it down. I've spent my life looking at the journey of a gay man. This book is amazing. My partner and I have practiced some of the healing techniques from this book, and they work!  I have reconnected to the "gay" ancestors because of this book.  The amazing thing is, while the author was writing this book, many of us were receiving the same message. Men Loving Men have something vital to give to humankind, and it's time we start living like it
