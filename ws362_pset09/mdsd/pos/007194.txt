The story of a lonely woman caught between love and propriety, self-sacrifice and self-interest, &quot;Two on a Tower&quot; is one of the saddest novels I've read.  I kept hoping for a description of a  blissful-but-brief interlude for Viviette, but it never materialized.   Instead, unhappiness dogged her to the novel's cruel end.  Yes, cruel.  The  final event in the book was an unnecessary stroke.  Also, while I usually  accept a character's actions, I cannot believe that Viviette NEVER  anticipated becoming pregnant.  The possibility certainly haunted ME from  the moment her secret marriage took place.        For all of it's sadness,  however, the story is engaging and provides a criticism of the unforgiving  social conventions of Hardy's time
