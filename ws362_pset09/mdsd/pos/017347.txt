I enjoyed this book, and learned from it as well.   The description of the siege was excellent: sufficient detail to provide context, not so much detail that the tempo was lost.

Some fascinating facts about fortifications and arms, as well as some of the people involved.

While as the title suggests this was a holy war for Constantinople, and a clash between Islam and the West, it was also a battle for a strategic trading port and a significant cultural jewel.  

Alas, much of the latter was lost in pursuit of the former.

Highly recommended to anyone who seeks more knowledge about both the city we now know as Istanbul and 15th century power struggles.
