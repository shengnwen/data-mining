Let me just start by saying that I LOVE this author; he is one of very few that I read simply because he wrote it.  
Saying that, although this is not my absolute favorite book of his I have ever read, it is one that I will recommend to every one who likes De Lint.
This book is entirely about Jilly who has to be one of the most likable characters ever created. Almost from the first page you are thrust into a heart breaking story that even threw it's moments of predictability is extremely entertaining none the less.
Even the best books aren't with out their problems;
The story jumps through various times through history which can get very confusing if you aren't paying attention and you could easily find yourself going back to the beginning of the chapter to find out who you are talking to and what year it is.
And I don't like the timing in the book, there are places where I don't want to wait two or three chapters to find out what happens and I had a really hard time not skipping ahead and missing some of the book.

Please don't let me stop you from buying it, this book really was wonderful, he has a way of telling stories that really makes you want to be a part of them. I promise you, this book is worth your money.
