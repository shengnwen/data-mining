For over 5 years now DNA studies have shown the average white Jewish person is around 70% directly descended from folks from the Syrian region now comprising Syria, Lebanon and Israel! This means that the Jew of today usually directly descended from the people who lived in Israel in the time of Judas Maccabeus and before. Yet the author never refers to such important genetic studies to illustrate the Jews right to currently Israel. BTW the Falashas are not directly descended from the people who lived in ancient Israel. They are not actual Jews. This DNA studies show as well
