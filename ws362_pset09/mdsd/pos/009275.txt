What a well written, inspiring work by Dan Barry. I have lived in the Deer Park area all my life and find it a pleasure to read of places i pass, see, or visit on a frequent basis. Although i was born a few years after Mr. Barry, i found it interesting to see how our area has changed, yet stayed the same from his youth here to mine.

His story i heroic and his lighthearted humor made me not want to stop reading. A winner!
