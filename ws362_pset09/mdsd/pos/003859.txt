Chances are that you already have this book in your IT library. But now, you need to put down whatever you're doing and start reading this book! Authors Norman Richards and Sam Griffith have done an outstanding job of showing you how to simplify the J2EE application development process and avoid the traps and complexity normally associated with such. 

Richards and Griffith begin by showing you how to install JBoss and getting the server up and running. Next, the authors show you how to build a simple web application, get it running on the server, and then monitor it. Then, they take the big step of showing you how to create a complete J2EE application with both a web and an EJB component. Richards and Griffith continue by turning their attention toward connecting to a real database, so as to have an application access a more robust and production-friendly database by using MySQL. In addition, the authors next show you how to configure the behavior of JBoss to allow for much more interesting security policies around applications. They also look at how JBoss handles logging. Richards and Griffith next continue with a detailed description of how to customize the CMP entity beans' persistence. Next, the authors show you how to use the Web Console. Finally, they walk you through the default JBoss installation and show you what updates are needed to get JBoss instance ready to be exposed to the outside world.

With the preceding in mind, the authors have done an excellent job crafting the book with the application developer in mind. At the end of the day, you'll know how to install JBoss to rolling out an actual production system.
