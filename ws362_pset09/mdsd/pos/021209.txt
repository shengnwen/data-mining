The Senator and the Socialite:... is the story of Reconstruction Senator from Mississippi Blanche Bruce. 

Although an excellect book about Reconstruction and how an ambitious former slave could posper and become a Plantation owner himself and game the corrupt political system to become a U.S. Senator, the real story here is about black society, skin color and how one family managed to thrive in it. At least for a couple of generations.

This book is an excellent read along with "Redemption" by Nicholas Leman
