This book I just purchased a week ago and it has served me well. I am a graduate of 8th grade and I know that this book would be useful in so many branches of school work such as oral presentations and visual aids. This book describes in a lot more detail than I could ever have emagined. I'd recommend this book to history teachers any time and for 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders learning about this subject. GREAT BOOK!!
