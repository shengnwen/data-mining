When I first read this book several years ago, I hated it. I saw no reality in the story of Delia Grinstead, a 40-year-old wife and mother who quite literally walks out of her family's life one day--and stays away.

With my second reading, however, I see what made her walk away. I see how a woman can feel so totally invisible to her loved ones that the pull of gravity can simply release her from her bonds, so to speak.

Of course Delia isn't REALLY released from anything. Walking away from her Baltimore family into a new life as "Ms. Grinstead" in a small Maryland town allows her to experience life on an entirely different level. Here, she gets a job as a secretary (rigid Ms. Grinstead), makes a number of eclectic friends (this is where Tyler always shines, in describing the small idiosyncracies of ordinary people), and creates a new life for herself. 

But what of those she left behind? Can she honestly put them away like a faded photograph? Read and see...I'm glad I gave this lovely story another chance
