Typee was Melville's first book.  The great symbolic prose of Moby Dick is not to be seen here, but it is interesting to get a sense of the development of Melville's writing.  This book is a semi-fictional account of Melville's experiences in the South Seas.  While his own visit was a brief one, the hero of this book ends up in the Typee Valley for four months.  Melville used numerous current accounts in order to flesh out this story.  A strong point of this Riverside edition is that it also includes several of these sources, so that the reader can get a sense of what else was available on South Island life at the time.  Most of these contemporary sources are imperialistic or surprisingly inaccurate.  This is a good read for those who are interested in the development of cross-cultural relations between Westerners and the natives of the South Seas.  Not surprisingly, Westerners come out in a bad light.  It will make you question what the word 'civilization' means
