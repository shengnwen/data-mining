One of a series of must read books on Vietnam for all who want to enter the field of International Relations and Foreign Policy. The author in a  very methodical way details how America's National Security Apparatus of  decision-making simply stalemated over Vietnam, not due to blunders but to  positions that were well argued from both stand points. One group of  advisors recommended no withdraw at any price. The other could not agree on  how to win a victory and then exit. In the meantime, four presidents  Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon tried to win and escape at the same  time as American boys blood reigned on the soaked soil of Vietnam. Although  few blame Harry Truman's mistake by forcing a limited war to save South  Korea, fewer know Truman started us in Vietnam as well when he first gave  $10 million in Military Aid to the French in 1947. However, every president  after him escalated the war to win it, only to see all attempts for peace  evaporate when trying to stop it. What you find is the explanation in this  book on why such outstanding advisors to five presidents could only agree  to escalation to prevent withdrawal but develop no victory strategy at the  same time. Leslie Gelb answers and details the blunders at the very center  of National Security Council points of view. If you want to see how  decisions were made back then, this is the book for you! In the end, you  will question why so many failed leaving so many to die and few excuses to  remember
