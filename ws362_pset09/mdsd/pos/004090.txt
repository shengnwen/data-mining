A great book to take along on vacation. Enjoy interesting well written mysteries by true masters of the genre. Compilations often come off as pretentious and try to reach above what they really are, pure entertainment. The editor selected great examples, not a dud in the bunch, and 25 stories gives you more than twice the content of most collections and that alone is worth the investment. Buy! Read! Enjoy
