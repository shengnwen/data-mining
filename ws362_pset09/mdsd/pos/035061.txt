Lawrence Block is the mystery writer for the thinking person. His Bernie books are witty, humorous, well-written, and, most importantly, never take the reader for granted. These books are intelligent and are completely  satisfying. This book, the first in more than ten years, is a thoroughly  enjoyable read, and unfailingly entertaining. Most highly recommended
