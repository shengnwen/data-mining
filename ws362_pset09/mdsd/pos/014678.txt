I read this book about 25 years ago as a teenager and couldn't put it down. It provided a very unflattering portrait of Jagger and Richard, which resonated up until, and including, the present. Curious, I read it again and found just as absorbing. Perhaps some things are slightly embellished, but it does have an air of believability to it. Some of these anecdotes are so bizarre, it seems highly unlikely that they were just plucked from someone's imagination. In a way, it all makes perfect sense. The author worked for Keith Richards for many years, and as the latter grew richer and more famous, he also became more isolated from reality. Therefore, it's hardly a stretch to find out that he basically did whatever he wanted, even if it meant harming others. The tone of the book is even-tempered, not pompous or egotistical in the least. Having said all of this, there's no denying Jagger and Richards's enormous talent, but there's never been a correlation between artistic gifts and being a good person. Even if only half of the book is true, it's a pretty poor indictment of their characters. I should mention too that the book is hilarious at times and also quite entertaining.
