In Pacific Vortex adventurer Dirk Pitt, vacationing in Hawaii, finds a message in a bottle addressed to an Admiral.  It's apparently the log of a missing nuclear submarine.  The Navy enlists Pitt's aid in searching for and raising the sub, which disappeared in a region north of Hawaii where, like in the Bermuda Triangle, numerous ships have been disappearing for decades.  In the meantime, someone tries to kill Pitt.  The plot is sort of formulaic - reasonably predictable - but written well enough, with suspense and a little humor, for escapist entertainment.  This one almost has more cliches than plot twists, but was still an enjoyable, easy read
