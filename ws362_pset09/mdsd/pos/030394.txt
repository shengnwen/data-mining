Mark Kriegel has written a fine biography which reads effortlessly as if it were a movie. Although, despite the clarity of the writing style, there are two attributes of the narration which cause me to lower it a star. Some of the text is tainted by Kriegel's own political/cultural opinions. This is not surprising as sports writers are often the most conformist in regards to trends. Political correctness is the rage today and Kriegel is a faithful imbiber of it. He appears to be obsessed with race which he refers to constantly even though Nameth was completely above racism. He also buys into the leftist canard about "social justice" and makes use of the term in its fashionable sense even though its appropriate definition should be, "when people keep what they earn." This irritable element added a slightly acrid taste to an otherwise savory work.
