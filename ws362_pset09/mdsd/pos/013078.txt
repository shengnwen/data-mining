Across our nation every Sunday, millions of Americans get all dressed up and go to their little social clubs they call houses of worship. They chant the name Jesus a couple of hundred times, without ever really noting what Jesus talked about. Their leaders rant mostly about two issues that Jesus never even mentioned.

Then these Americans go home and unknowingly or mindlessly (depending upon your point of view) support the murder of innocents abroad, throw thousands of their countrymen out of work, help implement policies that reduce their own security, and make it harder to buy gas, save for retirement, obtain quality health care or send their kids to college.

Most of the time they do this simply to obtain peer group approval, to be accepted into their little club. This is exactly what the ancient Pharisees, who executed Christ, did in their day.

This book points up the error of these ways by focusing on things that Jesus actually taught (imagine that!). It illustrates these ideas with actual action items that people can take to not only follow the instructions of Jesus but also to make our society more socially responsible. After all that's what Jesus was really all about
