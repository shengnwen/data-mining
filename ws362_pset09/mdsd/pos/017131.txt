I am a civil engineer with forced air heat in my house, so I have little need to know about steam heat, but when I was in high school I worked in a plumbing store. I read this book during almost every lunch break, and before resigning for an engineering job, bought my own copy. The way it is written, I can just pick it up and read it. The format is so easy to understand that despite having no field experience, I think I could go to a steam system, and have a pretty good idea of what is wrong. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who has even a slight interest in the power of steam heat
