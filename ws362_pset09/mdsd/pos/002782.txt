The things that I found to be the most helpful in this package was the fact that it was very thorough and there were multiple examples for each section along with a wide range of topics dealing with everyday situations in the business world.  This package helped me in understanding some of the key aspects in training and development such as self-assessments and proper ways to construct agendas. It also outlined a development plan for improving supervisory ability.  The thing that I appreciated was that it is possible to use this program with managers, supervisors, or can be done with employees and supervisors.  This book is very complete and could be very beneficial to any supervisor, manager, consultant, or employee if the program is used properly and taken seriously
