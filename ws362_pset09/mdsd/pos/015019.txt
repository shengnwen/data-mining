I'd recommend absolute beginners cut your teeth on Windows Movie Maker or iMovie or similar entry level app. Get some successes and gain a comfort level with the workflow and basic editing techniques. Later, graduate to Vegas, Premiere or Final Cut for more advanced capabilities.

Video editing (like you see in TV) requires a fair amount of learning. As a result this book is not geared for beginners, as the app IMO is not for beginners either. If you are determined, go for it, it's a great creative outlet!

Even with Vegas 7 release, this book is still very relevant and worthwhile if you want to get full use out of Vegas. DSE's knowledge goes beyond the manual. He helps explain WHY, and what tool to use, which the manual does not. The book is right by my side during sessions and it's a great reference.

As for the book, yes does need a good proofreader and some of the illustrations could be ommitted - all fair enough comments.  What is off base are complaints about the price. Apparently they have not bought any technical books lately. Keep in mind the years of specialized knowledge you are getting... it's really a bargain
