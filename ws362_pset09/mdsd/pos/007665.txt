 I have been using this book for about three weeks. I find the text to be easy to understand and informative. The accompanying CD adds realism to the practices by using data from a fictitious company. Also, the tips and examples are very helpful. I would recommend Sep By Step Access 2000 to anyone who is a beginner or needs a refresher to Access 2000
