This short book on number theory by one of the giants of 20th century  mathematics is delightful to read. Its length motivates one to finish the  book, and it is packed full of interesting results. Most of the theory  discussed in the book has wide-ranging applications, such as cryptography  and dynamical systems. The last chapter of the book is the best and covers  the subject of modular forms, including theta functions, Hecke operators,  and general modular functions. If you want to understand the Wiles proof of  Fermat's last theorem, start with this book
