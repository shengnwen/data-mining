Excellent book.  Not only is this book based on a life of a top DEA agent, but it's also written very well!  It's not dry nor tedious, it's a pleasure to read!  And the information contained here is a goldmine. 

This book is a 'must-read' for every single hard-working Patriotic American who is ready to Wake Up.
