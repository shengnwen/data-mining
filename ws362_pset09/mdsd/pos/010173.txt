A friend recently recommended this book. In this deep-ecology classic, Berry examines man's relationship with the earth.  He explores our mistaken beliefs that we are separate from the planet, and that it exists solely for  human destruction, pollution, exploitation and profit.  He encourages us to  take responsibility.  This book forever changed the way I will look at our  world.  Read it.  Then read Wes Nisker's &quot;Buddha's Nature&quot; (1998/2000)  to learn, from a buddhist perspective, how to put Berry's &quot;dream&quot;  into everyday practice
