Miss Zukas is a hoot! The characters are delightful and quirky including Helma( not Helm, Please!). The plots are solid and keep the reader entertained. Helma Zukas is a refreshing sleuth in the light/cozy mystery genre in that she is cool and collected, organized and a bit too set in her ways, but with her zany friends and family members and co-workers who tolerate her staid existence well, the mayhem is all the more enjoyable.
I will miss this series when it ends
