	The youth of Frank McCourt is one that I would never wish upon any other human being.  Often starving or ill, his whole family is disjoint and falling apart whether in Brooklyn, New York or Limerick, Ireland.  His father's alcoholism and his younger siblings' mortality rate both enrage and soften the reader of this tremendous memoir.  He constantly captures these moments of his childhood wonderfully in his seven-year-old voice.  His description of his father's desire for his sons to die for Ireland is almost comically scary,
"He's pushing in our door and singing, And if, when all a vigil keep, The West's asleep, The West's asleep!  Alas! And well my Erin weep, That Connnacht lies in slumber deep, But hark! A voice like thunder spake `The West's awake!  The West's awake! Sing, Oh hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake'" (111).

The way that McCourt captures the voice of his drunken, patriotic father is heartbreakingly wonderful.  Telling the whole story through his own eyes as he grows up himself adds a level to the storytelling that few other authors can mimic.  If you liked Mary Karr's The Liars' Club, you will love Angela's Ashes in the same way.  Both Karr and McCourt capture the voice of a child perfectly.  Another thing that McCourt does with scenes like this is to present to the reader the rich passion his father has for Ireland and set the scene of his childhood even better.  As Karr did with her father's loyalty to Texas, McCourt does with his father's obsession with his homeland.  Both of them use specific scenes with each parent to really deliver the story of their lives.  Angela's Ashes blew me away and I would recommend it to anyone.
