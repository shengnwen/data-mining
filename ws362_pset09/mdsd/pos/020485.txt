No doubt this is one of the greatest experience of high school math--problem solving. However, for those who are aspired for a taste or challenge in math contests but less well prepared, there is a book translated from the Russian which would be an ideal course for self learning--High School Mathematics by Yakovlev, ISBN 5030010114. Over 800 pages comprehensive yet concise and lucid!! They are great books and only the very best Russian math engineer students learn from them.
