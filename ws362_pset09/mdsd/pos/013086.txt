KILLING GAME is another enjoyable CSI story, although I found the actual plot to be a bit too predictable for my taste.  However, I finished this story in a day, and was happy with the advanced character-development that this particular story held.  If you enjoy CSI as much as I do, you won't be disappointed in reading these serialized novels
