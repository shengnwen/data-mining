Dudley Lynch and Paul Kordis set the stage with "The Strategy of the Dolphin," a book that called attention to the need to explore our "home thinking base" if we are to make any significant improvements in our lives.  

Now, Dudley Lynch goes much further in describing how we need to vastly morph the way we use our brain if we are to match the dizzying speed of change in the new millennium.  The book masterly reviews Dr. Clare Graves' scale of values and brings to life his teachings by suggesting a road map to reach breakthrough developments in our lives.  

"The Mother of All Minds" should be required reading for all leaders, managers, coaches and entrepreneurs aiming to go beyond their current limitations and helping their companies and families to transform themselves from the inside-out, from puppa to winged marvel like a butterfly.

The MOAM is an honest, fully researched, head-on,  "get real" wake up call to all readers.  You will never forget its lessons.
