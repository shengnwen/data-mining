Caregiving is a special gift, written from the heart.  I haven't been able to keep a copy.  As soon as I get a new one, I give it away.  The saying goes that one can't judge a book by its cover, but Caregiving's cover  picture reveals the depths to which one goes, as page by page Beth shares  her own and others experiences with caregiving, death, and the growth that  can come from such profound moments.  As a licensed clinical social worker  and as someone who has experienced the death of both parents, I say brava!   A wonderful weaving of poetic wisdom and practical suggestions
