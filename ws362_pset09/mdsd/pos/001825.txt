This is a good book. Not something you sit down and read but rather something you sit by the bed and read a chapter now and then. It's long but its worth the time. Took me a few months. You'll read about all kinds of real people and their courageous acts that seperate them from the normal. Everyone from Gandhi, to Shackleton, to Lord Nelson and Abraham Lincoln to Martin Luther King and Mother Teresa. I think there is 36 in all. The diversity is great since you read about all times in history and all kinds of situations and people. Loved it.
