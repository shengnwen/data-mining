Those of us who have kept up with this series will be both amused and touched by the birth of Mavis' baby.  The ending brings a tear or two especially if you have gone thru the 'process'.  Eve and Roarke's reactions are downright funny and right on.  And the concept of male birth control pills is a forever dream of mine in my field of abuse counselling!

The two mysteries melded together nicely. For a while I thought I would have to keep up with two separate ones.  But it worked beautifully.  Nora is a wonder!! Loved her picture on the backcover and imagine she sees a little of Eve in herself.  Well done.

The words were terse.  Hip lingo keeps omitting words from sentences but it fits in Eve's world.  All the usual characters are included in the book; some more than others.  Well worth the read.
