    This book enabled me to keep my sanity and enjoy family mealtime again! My son was recovering from jaw surgery. I was fixing a meal for the family and preparing something separate for my son. He grew weary of the blandness and monotony. I became tired and frustrated. The whole family was cranky. The solution was The Dysphagia Cookbook. The food was easy enough for my son to eat, palatable to the rest of the family, and I had only one meal to prepare! The recipes offer variety and flexibility. I found recipes for mature tastes as well as meals for a child's delight. I was pleasantly surprised to find a few new cocktails as well! Swallowing difficulties or not, anyone could use this cookbook.
