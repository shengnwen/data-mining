This is a great guide to the healing effects of an ancient medicinal plant that has gained great popularity in the last decade based on scientific findings. The author first looks at the problem of depression by discussing the biochemistry of the brain and the relationship between mental and physical health. 

St John's Wort (hypericum) offers a gentle way of treating depression and other nervous disorders. Cass discusses the scientific proof of the efficacy of this herb as measured against synthetic antidepressants. The research is indeed encouraging and the plant's mild side effects provide a great advantage over the synthetic medicines. 

The author explores the correct dosage for various problems like sleep and seasonal affective disorders (SADs) whilst pointing out the herb's anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and immune enhancing properties. Besides the well-known hypericin, St John's Wort also contains a host of other phytochemicals that play vital roles in protecting cells from damage, in repairing damage and in regeneration. 

These ingredients include GABA, carotenoids, flavonoids, hyperforin, limonene, lutein, phytosterols, quercetin, quercetrin, rutin and xanthones.  All parts of the plant, the flowers, leaves, stem and the oil are used in healing. One of the possible side effects of taking St John's Wort is sensitivity to the sun in certain people. 

The book includes a bibliography, a natural medicine resources list, a protocol for switching a patient from an anti-depressant to St John's Wort and the regulatory status of St John's Wort in various countries. It concludes with an index. I also recommend Mind Boosters by Ray Sahelian and The A to Z Guide to Supplements by Phyllis A Balch for further information on herbal medicines.
