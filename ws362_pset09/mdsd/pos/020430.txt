This book was such a joy to read.  I found it hilarious.  Yes, it's silly & unbelievable at times (like other reviewers suggested), but it's FICTION PEOPLE!  Of course the characters are over-the-top, it's based in LA.  I got the book from my sister & passed it on to many friends.  They all loved it.  It's a light, easy read that will take your mind off of your own problems and allow you to escape into the shallow lives of the rich & beautiful. P.S.- another great read that is similar to this is The Nanny Diaries
