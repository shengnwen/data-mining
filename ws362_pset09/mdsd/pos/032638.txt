Al Capone Does my Shirts is a fast and on to the point type of book. Its easy to read for my grade level. If you like fast and adventure books, Al Capone Does my Shirts would be good for you. The whole story really kicks in when Moose's dad had just received a job at Alcatraz as a security guard. Moose doesn't like Alcatraz because his dad had no time to hang out with Moose. Moose's sister is Actually older then Moose but said to be younger. She is autistic and doesn't speak a lot. If you took a marble form her marble collection she could tell you which marble you took with just a glance at the marble set.

I would give this book a 4/5. it's a really good book for people who like to read books that moves in a fast pace and have some great scenes, for example, when piper told every one about the cons when she wasn't suppose to say anything
