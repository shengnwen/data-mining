Having seen the movie numerous times and believing it to be the ultimate war/anti-war film, I decided to read the novel on which the movie was based.  I was not disappointed because the novel seems to create a movie in ones brain and you find yourself in the boots of those young men fighting for their lives.  It is a novel about a brotherhood of soliders who when placed in a desperate situation had only each other to rely on.  It also is a story about how a super power that put men on the Moon and circled Mars with a space vehicle, couldn't direct a convoy of vehicles a matter of yards.  A tremendous read and given our situation in Iraq, a very topical story
