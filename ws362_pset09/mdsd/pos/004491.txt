I recently bought both of Cathe's recipe books (this one and "Simply Natural Baby Food") to give my baby the best possible. They are simply amazing! Every recipe that I've tried were not only good, but excellent! I'm very impressed.  These books really motivate me in the kitchen.  My husband enjoys being the "guinea pig" for the taste tests :)

Highly recommended for people seeking natural healthy food recipes!

note: I used my husband's Amazon account for this review (Anike)
