David Remnick  was an amazing author when it came to writing this book. He used great details including interviews for people, stories about fighters, and Muhammad Ali's life and career. The book begins with days before Ali discussing Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. In great detail, Remnick talks about those two fighting and then he works into Muhammad Ali's career. The author's veracity was never called into question by me. Remnick's many references and thoughts made me seem like I was in the story. Remnick captures the legacy of Muhammad Ali and really portrays his life well. Remnick explains how Ali came to be and the road he took as he battled his way through life as well as in the ring
