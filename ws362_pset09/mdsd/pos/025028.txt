I'm beginning to understand why this author's Amelia Peabody series is so popular.  The pace is fast, the quips are faster and Amelia and her Emerson are two of the most likeable sleuths out there.  They are a perfect foil for each other, and each is a strong character.  These books are a nice combination of mystery and romance done with a light hand.  In this book Amelia and Emerson take up where they left off in the previous book.  They are a year later in their chronicle, but they're still trying to capture the Master Criminal.  Who is he and what's his game?  They can't seem to figure it out.  There are a couple more dead bodies that turn up with this particular quest, and still they don't really know who they're looking for.  He is a master of disguise and an elusive phantom that nobody can really describe.  But we have a lot of fun throughout anyway
