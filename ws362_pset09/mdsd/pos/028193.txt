In response to those who had nothing but nasty to say about this version of the Bible: Any Bible is better than no Bible at all.  It's hard for those of us with no trouble reading to understand what it's like for anyone who has problems with it.  Even the "easy to read" translations like the NIV or the NLT can be intimidating to people having trouble reading.  The Message makes the meaning clear without being overly complicated to read.
No one is making you read it.. if you don't like it, then don't read it.  But don't tell others that they shouldn't read it either
