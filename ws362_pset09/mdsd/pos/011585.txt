To-date (may soon be overturned as I'm trying a new one from Tim Powers now) -- this is the best book Tim Powers has written.  I have tried some of his other stuff and it has been like he is a one-hit wonder.  The Anubis Gates is a very good read that he has not matched again in my view.  Here's hoping that my current trial of another of his books comes close to this one
