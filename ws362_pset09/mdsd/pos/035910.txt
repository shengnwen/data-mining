Stephen Covey is on way to conduct a seminar in India on the 8th Habit and this reminds me of my previous read of Stephen Covey 'Principle Centered Leadership' - Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day...the very quote says a lot. Stephen Covey opens up your mind to the permanent things - values, family, relationship, communication. He gives an insight to create a long-term meaningful relationship and be success at workplace and home. He defines how to increase quality and productivity by impressive charts as :

*Alternate Life Centers & Organizational Centers
*Four Levels of Principle centered leadership with key principles
*Seven habits maturity Continuum
*Power Process
*Pyramid of Influence
*Four Paradigms
*Six Conditions of Empowerment

In Chapter Seven, the Author focus on Seven deadly sins referring to Mahatma Gandhi's quote:All to do with social and political conditions:

*Wealth without work
*Pleasure without conscience
*Knowledge without character
*Commerce without morality (Business without ethics)
*Science without humanity
*Religion without sacrifice
*Politics without Principle

He charts out how the seven habits will help you avoid seven deadly sins. Stephen Covey's Thirty Methods of Influence in Chapter 11 centers around positive influence with people in our personal and professional lives. He explains how we can powerfully and ethically influence to win new business, keep customers, maintain friendships, change behaviors or improve marriage and family relationships. 

Chapter 13 - Making champions of your childen is one chapter that weigh stress to build their self esteem with added scoops of guidance. 

Divided into section 1 and 2, the book has 31 chapters - each one a unique approach with powerful reading with his principles of vision, leadership and human relationships. Section 1 deals with Personal and Interpersonal Effectiveness whereas Section 2 focus on Managerial and Organizational Development. This becomes a practical teaching tool for business leaders. Covey's Principles make a great sense and I recommend this book for all exisiting and future leaders who would like to scale high with the perfect blend of Stephen Covey's wisdom, compassion and practical experience. Good Pick.
