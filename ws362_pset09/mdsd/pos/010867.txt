Enjoyable reading this is not. Gripping, it most certainly is. Eye-witness accounts from actual survivors of some of the most cruel treatments men have ever had to endure; but endure they did! The actual battle conditions were strength sapping enough; arduous fighting whilst suffering from the effects of frequent food shortages. Then capture by an enemy that, by it's own strict code of honour, made them contemptuous of any soldiers that became their prisoners. The lucky ones died quickly. Those not so fortunate suffered the &quot;death march&quot; through the Bataan Peninsular to their respective camps in other parts of the islands, followed by years of brutal treatment &amp; torture, both physical &amp; mental, together with the debilitating affects of starvation, slavery, disease with minimum medical attention. Some poor devils followed this with a hellish sea journey in overloaded, cramped, steaming hot, holds of cargo ships, to similar treatment in the prison camps of Japan &amp; Manchuria. Final release brought freedom &amp; repatriation to a United States that recognised &amp; rewarded only the war heroes. Most POW's had huge problems convincing US doctors that their divers post-captivity symptoms were in fact, prison camp related. Not necessarily the doctors' fault since the headaches, nightmares, stress related sufferings, were poorly researched at that time. Most ex-prisoners received little, or no, real effective attention &amp; the phsycological traumas resulted in a high incidence of drinking problems &amp; suicides amongst those unfortunates. A sad &amp; poignent ending to the book. The accounts are not all strife &amp; gloom. There are some humourous &amp; up-lifting moments recounted, particularly where &quot;buddies&quot; were supporting each other in adversity. Knox does a truly great job in presenting the accounts in such a clear &amp; chronological order that the end result reads like a novel. Read it, &amp; weep
