I was given this book  by the Richmond Down Syndrome Society when our daughter was born with Down Syndrome.  It was quite a shock as we did not know she would be born with DS.  I knew right away when she was placed in my arms (I'm a special education teacher)and within 20 hours of birth she was whisked away to the Medical College of Virginia.  This book was so very helpful to both myself, my husband and my family.  We all learned so much from it and we passed it along to my brother (her guardian in the event something were to happen with us) and his wife.  They also found it helpful as they knew what to expect.  Overall,  I cannot stress enough that these children are so wonderful in their own way and this book helps to give you an inside view of what to expect with your new baby.
