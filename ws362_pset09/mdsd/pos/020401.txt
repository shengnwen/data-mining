This is a beautiful book of wonderful pieces of art which are all done with transparent collage images.  The reason I got this book was because I love to work with this medium.  They have that see-thru quality that resonates into a different look at art.

So much of the art work in this book is so easy to do, I was amazed.  The directions are clear and concise and even a novice can do some of these projects. Working with varied mediums such as glass, wood and fabric made the transparent images look different and new.  

I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't tried their hand at working with transparencies in their collages or altered art.  They will be surprised at how this medium will enhance their art.
