This is one of those books that i called "walking with a good friend book". What i mean is that when you read this book, it is so well written and so informative and so true that it feels that you are walking with a good friend who is talking to you about a subject in which he is an expert.The author is magnificent when explaining the political situation in Iran.Her approach is very simple but very informative since she is not in the business of predicting the conditions in Iran,just to give the reader a taste of what's going on in Iran and what the people in Iran are thinking.I truly enjoy this book as i was looking to understand and learn more about a country so difficult to understand.Truly a magnifivent work!!
