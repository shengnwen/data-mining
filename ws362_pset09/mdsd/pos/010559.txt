Logan Bruno... Mary Anne Spier.  What can I possibly say to give justice to my absolute adoration of this book?  This has always been my all time  favorite of the series.  It shows that a sweet personality such as Mary  Anne's is appreciated by even the finest breed of stud.  I love it how Mary  Anne gets the dude!  The only unrealistic part of the book is when Mary  Anne wears her famous cities skirt to two consecutive and substantial  &quot;with Logan&quot; functions-- the dance and the surprise party.  I  hate that part!   And that Alan Gray orphan Annie eyes blurb is  hilarious.!~  Did Claudia almost say bra strap in from of a boy
