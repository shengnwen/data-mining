A Tale of Love and Darkness is a dense, beautiful memoir about the youth of the well-known Israeli writer, Amos Oz, and of his country, Israel. By telling the stories of his parents and grandparents, Ashkenazi Jews, who fled Eastern Europe for the Holy Land when Hitler rose to power, he tells a story of the history of the Jewish people from the nineteenth century to the birth of modern-day Israel. But the story is also intensely personal, focusing on the devastating effects of his parents unhappy marriage and his mother's depression and eventual suicide on this young, sensitive and precocious artist. A remarkable book.
