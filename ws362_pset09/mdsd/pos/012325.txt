"Mr.Tanen!" "where is your umbrella tie it's raining?!!"
Mr.Tanen ALWAYS wore great funfilled ties,until Mr.Apple told Mr.Tanen he HAD to be proper!!! Mr.Tanen didn't feel right one day so he stayed home. Mr.Apple was the sub principal. each of Mr.Tanen's ties in his closet held a symbol {ex.hearts for love}.See how Mr.Tanen's absence turns Mr.Apple into a good apple!!!
