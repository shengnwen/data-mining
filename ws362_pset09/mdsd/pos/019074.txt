I enjoyed reading the book The Tiger Rising. I liked it because it was a short story and easy to follow along. The book held my attention because it was about a boy who makes friends with a tiger and I like animals to. One thing I didn't like about the book was the ending. I wish the tiger did not have to die. I would recommend this book to both boys and girls because it is exiting and sad. The next time I'm at the library I am going to get a book by the same author
