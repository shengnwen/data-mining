This book was recommended to me by a colleague. We are both in the marketing field and were having a frank conversation about how we struture relationships with clients. I read it during a car trip to California last weekend (don't worry - my husband was driving!). I giggled nervously several times at the unabashed "no b.s." honesty and confidence behind Dan Kennedy's advice. I personally have been guilty of many of the mistakes Dan speaks of, such as not placing a high enough value on my services. I heard myself repeating favorite phrases from the book to myself that apply to me. I've already told some fellow entrepreneurs about the book, and I just ordered Dan's time management book for myself.
