This collection of fairly late production contains some of the very best Borges stories. 
One of my favourite stories is the title story, The book of sand.
The idea of a perpetually changing and endless book is simultaneously both
 a great dream and a nightmare for avid readers throughout the world.
 Borges' large literary scope - he has read an extraordinary
 amount of both well and less known authors- his characteristic 
 introductory quotations and his extremely compact, precise language
 are the main reasons that lead me to do some translations of
 his work into Finnish that may have helped to revive an
 interest in this incomparable Argentian master over here.
 In my opinion, this book is worth not only reading bur re-reading until
 the pages turn into powder - or shall we say sand..
