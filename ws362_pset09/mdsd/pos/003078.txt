Offers an in-depth, how-to guide to evaluating training programs. The book distinguishes itself by employing a four-level approach to evaluation. The levels are: 
- reaction of participants (customer satisfaction) 
- learning (extent to which participants change attitudes, improve knowledge, and/or increase skill) 
- behavior (extent to which change in behavior has occurred)
- results (outcomes that occurred as a consequence of program attendance). 

The book includes detailed case studies, exhibits, research results, techniques and formulas for measuring success. The majority of chapters target specific types of programs, such as: 
- training for nonexempt employees, 
- developing supervisory skills, 
- desktop application course, 
- leadership training, 
- leadership development
and many more. 

A very impressive, practical, comprehensive and informative work
