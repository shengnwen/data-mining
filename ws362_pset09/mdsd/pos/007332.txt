This has always been a staple reference book for architects since my student days. I haven't bought a copy for many years, so I was pleased to see that it has been revised and updated to include plenty of relevant new data. Unlike a US-published competitor this book is in metric, and is more expansive in its coverage of building types. A really useful reference tool for all building space planners, architects and interior designers
