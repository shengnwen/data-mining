One of the most revealing insights of this commentary on Paul's Epistle to the Galatians is that it is not the supposed legalism of the Pharisees.  Matera points out that recent archeoloigcal evidence has placed Paul's words about the Law and the application of it to the problem of circumcision of the Gentiles is not about applying the letter of the law.  The Law of circumcision, sabbath observance and dietary regulations had to do with maintaining one's status as a member of the Jewish race.  The imposition of circumcision in this view is the imposition of a cultural practice upon those for whom this practice has no historical, social or religious relevance.  This insight opens up the concept of what evangelization means and entails.  The early Jewish Christians would not be the only or the last Christian form tradition  to impose cultural imperatives on people.  Europeans did the same in the imperialistic invasions of the 18th and 19th centuries.  The Christianity that accompnaied these incursions was strictly European and did not respect the faith of the indigent people.  Paul's view then of Christ living in the Christian applied in this way creates broader boundaries for evangelization and helps missionaries to see Christ in the face of the people already there
