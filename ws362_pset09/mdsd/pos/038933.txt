I found this book to be highly readable and to stand as an important example of immigrant and post-immigrant fiction. The Chinese-American experience is different from the Jewish-American experience or the Irish-American experience, but they also have a great deal in common. Tan successfully portrays the younger generation's desire to conform to American ideals and the older generation's often stubborn resistance to acculturation. Somewhere in between lies a happy medium that is often not attained until a third or fourth generation.

My only gripe is not with the book itself but with the notion that this is a profound work of literature that needs to be taught in high school or even college classes. I see it as excellent popular fiction, which is a major achievement, but not as a book for the ages
