A very probing look into the Balkans, Winchester's book raises simple yet profound questions about the hatred between so many peoples in the Balkans.  The author did a very good job of putting the smoldering anger and resentment in historical perspective taking us not just back to the Austria-Hungary and Ottoman empires, but even further back to the Byzantine empire!  It is this historical perspective that makes the questions so well thought out.  In the end, Winchester has no answers, and I found myself disappointed that I could not have simple answers to such difficult questions.  I walked away from the book with a better understanding, but every bit as puzzled, as when I entered the book, so it has provoked me to look deeper into the subject.  It has put me on a path to learn more about the region
