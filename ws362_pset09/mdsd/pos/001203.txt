I bought this book about a year ago, after having purchased my first home.  Since then, I have purchased a second home, and discovered what it means to be a landlord. This book inspired me to become a landlord, and has helped me through the process, tremendously.

Well thought out, well organized, totally accessible to the novice (and helpful to those who already have a few properties, as I am told by my more experienced friends for whom I purchased this book), Building Wealth One House at a Time discusses manageable steps that we must take in realizing personal wealth through the real estate market. 

This is not a get-rich-quick scheme.  This is a formula meant to target the focused individual, who may or may not have much money up front- in fact, John Schaub discusses his own experience of creating personal wealth from very meager beginnings.  Schaub discusses the idea of acquiring one house a year, and renting each one out to high-quality tenants.  He also does touch on the idea of buying and selling shorter term, in order to gain initial capital, but the mainstay of this book focuses on acquiring and maintaining assets (single residential homes), for the long term.  

I  have pored over this book many times, in all aspects of my own real estate experience.  It is essential for the novice real estate investor, and offers great tools that even a more experienced investor can use.  It's small, but powerful
