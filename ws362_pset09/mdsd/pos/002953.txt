I bought this CD for my 9 year old nephew and I have to be honest that he hated it.  BUT it still worked, I told him to learn them and we'd quit listening to the CD and he learned at lightening speed just to get away from it.  The tunes can be a little folksy but I thought it was a good way to learn and it does stick in your head
