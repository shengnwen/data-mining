The final book in the Farseer Trilogy provides an excellent finish to a wonderful series. The build up to a dramatic climax is true to the best fantasy traditions. Many of the unanswered questions raised in the first two books of the series are left unresolved until the conclusion of the story creating a page turning frenzy.
 One criticism is the obvious lead into other series by leaving certain matters hanging. This is no real criticism, however, as it just means that I get to read more books by this excellent author
