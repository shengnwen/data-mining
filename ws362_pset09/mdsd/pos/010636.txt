Miles doesn't love shows on the WB (0r CW), he doesn't gush about J. Lo's posterior.  He doesn't rave about the football team's wins.  Miles  loves famous last words.

Teenagers have depth.  They feel things tremedously.  They are real people with real problems, real joys, and real angst.  It's nice to see them portrayed realistically in this novel by Green as opposed to the happily ever after teens found in other bubblegum YA novels.

Miles has no friends.  He is lonely.  He has two wonderfully warm parents (whom he even admits as 'such nice people'), but it's not enough.  He wants a chance to get away, become a new person, search out the Great Perhaps.

So, he embarks on a coming of age story.  And what a story it is.  He attends a private boarding school in Alabama where he finally makes friends.  He finds a place for himself.  Through his friend and roommate, Chip, and a quirky, moody girl, Alaska, Miles discovers who he is.  

Green creates beautifully tragic characters in this novel.  They make you want to find all the troubled kids in the world and talk to them.  Listen to them.  And make sure that they don't say their last words too soon
