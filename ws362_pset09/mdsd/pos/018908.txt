&quot;The Thurber Carnival&quot; was a beloved companion of my early youth; I laughed out loud again and again at the stories of &quot;My Life and Hard Times,&quot; the hilarious &quot;Fables for Our Time,&quot; &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,&quot; and other classics. What was really important to me about Thurber was that he came from the same part of Ohio that I did, and actually had had relatives and attended family reunions in Sugar Grove, Ohio, where I grew up. That meant all the world to me, because it showed me that someone who had ties to Sugar Grove could be a famous writer. Now, I love Thurber's work more than ever; as an adult, I can better appreciate the nuances of a story like &quot;The Catbird Seat.&quot; Thurber's work is a precise, funny, yet deeply serious portrait of an America which had just recently completed the transition from a frontier to an urban society. Women, having just won the right to vote, were flexing new-found muscles; men, divorced from the need to wrest a living from the soil, felt suddenly unmoored and emasculated; a new breed of self-help authors arose to make a quick buck from the newly uncertain populace;  and oceans of alcohol fueled the newly stirred resentments between the sexes.Thurber recorded it all, in a prose style as elegant and lucid as any in the history of American literature. &quot;The Catbird Seat,&quot; &quot;Fables for Our Time&quot; and the self-help parodies of &quot;Let Your Mind Alone!&quot; are every bit as fresh and pertinent as when Thurber wrote them 60-odd years ago. Unfortunately, some aspects of his work--most glaringly his portrayal of African-Americans--have not stood up so well. But one can only say of Thurber what the Duc de Saint-Simon said of Louis XIV: &quot;His virtues were his own, his faults were his times'.&quot; The best of James Thurber ranks with the best of Mark Twain, Ring Lardner, Woody Allen and any other American humorist you can name
