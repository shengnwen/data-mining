While our present day science curricullum owes much of it's insight to the inspirational theories of Charles Darwin, science as it is taught by schoolhouse instructors lacks the intestinal fortitude shown by the young  Darwin. If everyone involved in the study of science were to approach not  only life but science in the same manner as Charles Darwin who knows where  we would be today. Confusion over whether or not there is a supreme diety  has brought us to a virtual standstill in areas that desperately need our  further attention. After reading The Voyage of the Beagle, I came to  realize how Darwin was not intent on setting the religious world on its  head.  Instead he was living the dreams of any headstrong young man bent on  seeing the world in its purest form.  I would recommend this book to any  scientist or researcher for that matter who feels he/she has yet to feel  the fire light their inspirational drive
