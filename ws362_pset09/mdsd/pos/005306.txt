So apparently there is a great deal of controversy surrounding this book, at least according to those who have deigned to write a review about it. I myself had no idea until I read some of them, but only after I have read the book its self. I find it amusing the charges that a certain political bias is presented in this collection of essays, but only because it seems that particular bias comes at the expense of another. Most curious. At any rate, if you, like me, would like to have a resource that covers most of the great political thinkers of Western civilization, who's names you will discover when you read any of the other reviews, then this might well be the tome you are seeking. If the essays are presented in conservative terms here, then it should balance nicely the liberal terms in which they were originally presented in your classroom (I am after all making the presumption...). I have found this book to be highly useful in my continuing study of political philosophy, and reach for it more often than say, my copy of Das Kapital, or The Wealth of Nations. This could well be a function of my laziness, but I like to think it is because of the utility of History of Political Philosophy, and not just the defense of the ramparts of a particular ideology that is not embraced by all. You have a mind, so use it. If you need a quick and rich resource into western political thought, this book may well be of use to you. If, on the other hand, you are afraid that the supposedly conservative tones of this collection of essays might threaten your outlook, then by all means avoid it, and write disparaging reviews for it
