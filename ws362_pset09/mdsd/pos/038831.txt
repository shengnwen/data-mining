I used to read Drummer Hoff to my little girls in the late 1960's and  early 1970's, at the height of the antiwar movement.  I am saddened by the reviews that fail to find the message in this fine little book.  It was published in 1967, and is such an obvious antiwar book that I can only feel the reviewers have little sense of history.  The idyllic pastoral environment with little birds and flowers is blown to pieces at the end as the giant cannon, "Sultan," explodes.  It is a tale of the self-destructive savagery of war.  My little girls are now grown, about to have their own children, and I am giving Drummer Hoff to them, so their own antiwar instincts can be made vivid to their children in a language that all will find accessible and delightful
