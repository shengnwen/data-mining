I have been privileged to a member of a Baldrige team at a major service company who won the award, and consulting projects where the criteria was the major template for improvement.  This is, by far, the best effort I have seen which strategically presents and describes the criteria, then provides practical counsel on how to apply it.  As such, it is invaluable to examiners and consultants, and especially so to senior leaders and internal change agents attempting to improve performance within the Baldrige framework.  The authors' lucid explanations of the key linkages within the criteria are alone worth the purchase price.  The software included is worth many times the price.  If you are serious about using the Baldrige criteria, this is a book you cannot afford to be without
