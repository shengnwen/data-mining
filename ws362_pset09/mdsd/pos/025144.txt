Hilarious, witty, wonderful book.  The TV series (which appeared on PBS but does not seem, regrettably, to be available on video) did the book justice, but Sharpe's prose is outstanding.  No aspect of tradition or  effort to dislodge it escape's the author's scrutiny.  Well worth reading  again and again
