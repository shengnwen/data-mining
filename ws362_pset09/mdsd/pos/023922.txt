1  The book white water is a good book.  It's about a boy and his step brother go with their dad on a rafting trip.  When they start off it's easy.  Then when they stop to check out the next rapid their dad gets bit by a rattle snake.  Then its up to his oldest son to get them down river and get help.  2  It made me think about how good I have it and how lucky I am.  3  My favorite part is when they almost tip the raft over when they went over the big rapids.  4  I rated this book 4 stars because the book could have been longer and more exciting
