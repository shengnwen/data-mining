I was a little skeptical about the Puritan adventurer's tales, having only read Robert Howard's Conan (although other subsequent Conan writers, with the possible exception of Robert Jordan, don't hold a candle to Howard).  But these stories are fantastic and visceral, they capture and inspire the imaginative mind.

I am very glad that R.E.Howard's work is finally becoming more available, and while I didn't have the same problems that others have had with the binding on this book, a hardcover version would be really nice to have
