I laughed all the way through this book and could totally relate to her style of humor.   If you are a prissy wuss that sits around and tries to be Ms Perfect and think your child can't be watched by anyone but you, this is not for you.  If you are an individual and honor your sense of independence and may have been a rock star at some point in you life, you will enjoy this book
