An excellent overview of a controversial subject. Nothing in it should seriously offend either proponents of scientific medicine or proponents of alternative medicine. It is a good quick reference to most of the herbs and therapies in use today. Its presentation is balanced; giving pros, cons, possible side effects, dosages, etc. It clearly states which claims are based on proof, and which claims are not generally accepted. Particularly valuable is its discussion of how to choose what is best for you without getting scammed
