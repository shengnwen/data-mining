Bryson has been one of my favorite authors for years now - the first thing of his that I read was a magazine article comparing American weather extremes with those in his beloved England.  This collection of his writings on things American has me confused.  Most of it, as his wife points out, is griping about this and that.  Bryson has a tendency to talk down anything that doesn't fit into his view of how life ought to be and a maddening myopia when it comes to understanding why things are the way they are in this modern world.  Balancing that though is his self-deprecating humor and his beautiful writing skills.  There is a piece on global warming in this book that all ought to read.  So, basically, even though he is preachy, and a bit gripy, he is laugh-out-loud funny and writes so very well that I will keep reading him.
