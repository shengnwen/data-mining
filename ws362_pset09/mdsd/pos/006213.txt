If you need training help NOW, this is the book you should have! The Trainer's Tool Kit has gathered the best information and put it into 1 book!  Whether you are an experienced trainer or a novice, this book has  something for you.  You won't find heavy theory-based information in these  pages, just what you need to know in plain, easy language. It covers  everything from practical tips for training development and implementation  to helping you to be a better, more effective trainer.  I like the fact  that it covers so many different topics like adult learning principles,  facilitator tips, training materials, training trends and so much more. If  you can't spend thousands on resource books, this one is worth the money
