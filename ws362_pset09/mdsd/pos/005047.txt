For those who are put off by such things, this book includes child molestation, (basically) bestiality and several near-rape scenes.  But . . . it is Laymon - honestly, what else should you expect?  And - many of those who do, get what is coming to them.  Like many Laymon books, this is PURE horror - which means, no happy ending.  Once again, if that bothers you, perhaps you should skip this book.  However, I was riveted - Laymon can put out horror like no other and for horror enthusiasts, this is a must have.

The book includes a man who was one of the very few to escape the Beast House hiring a hit man to kill The Beast; a woman and her child that are on the run from her husband, who has been in jail for raping her daughter;  and the Beast House itself - a house in which many gruesome murders have been committed, and to which it is said you should not venture in the dark or the Beast will get you . . . Run by a creepy old woman, the Beast House overrides almost everything else with its foreboding presence.

I sometimes question my emotional health for enjoying horror novels the way I do . . . but I'm not the only one, so that makes me feel better :-)  The rest of you - if you don't yet have this classic of horror in your libraries - go and find it
