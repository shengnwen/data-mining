This book does a superb job describing the business of baseball.  Author John Helyar gives readers a strong historical perspective, explaining how and why the game got to be the way it is today (well, as of 1994).  The author devotes considerable attention to labor issues.  We learn about the days of reserve clause "slavery," the success of union chief Marvin Miller at winning gains for the players, and of owner attempts to cheat the players via collusion.  Readers see that the game's overseers (team owners) are often driven by greed and desire for power.  We also see why disparate, unshared local broadcast revenues give advantages to teams in large markets (New York, Los Angeles, etc.) and make it tough for small market teams like Kansas City and Milwaukee to compete.  The author also refutes that repeated owner lament that they are losing money.  Yes, a few teams (Montreal Expos) have bad years financially, but if most teams lost money - and they don't - then player paychecks would bounce, the price of franchises would stop rising, and owners would stop holding bidding wars for top free agents.    

At this writing, baseball is enjoying both ups and downs.  Last season (2005) saw another attendance record (74 million fans), but that means higher ticket prices, and one sees far fewer kids today playing the game in the sandlots.  Still, as the late Bill Veeck said, owners haven't been able to ruin baseball despite their best efforts.  Readers that like this book might consider similar books by Marvin Miller and announcer Bob Costas.
