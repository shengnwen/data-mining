I enjoyed reading this book. Though not especially new, it delves into the human mind, very imperfect phenomenon. The book is not a comprehensive work on psychology. Rather, it is aimed at awakening readers' interest in the field.

What is happiness and how can we achieve it? Based on studies, the author gives us an overview of how our brains work. And the results are often unexpected. Our perception of happiness changes, and changes often. Our brain does not deal with the reality that well either. Our perception of the past is often erroneous. Our perception of the future is always off the mark. Moreover, we cannot even be sure of what is happening right now! 

The reason I give the book four stars and not five is the style of writing. It is just too elaborate, and the book could be shorter. 

I also expected more interesting ending. But this does not make authour's conclusions less valid. I highly recommend this book
