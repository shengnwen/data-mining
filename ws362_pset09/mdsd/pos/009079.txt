This vivid account of the 1978 climb of K2 via the west ridge is an exciting follow up to the failed 1976 attempt up the east ridge.   The Last Step is thus a follow up to galen Rowell's wonderful book about that attempt called &quot;In the Throneroom of the Mountain Gods&quot;.    Ridgeway vividly describes the climbing, the horrendous bivoac at 27,000 feet and the hazardous descent, all without supplimental oxygen.   He also pulls no punches in describing the infighting and jealousy that upset the group, and while it was nothing like the brutal infighting that marred the 1976 climb, it had a power effect on the overall climb.   While Jon Krakauer has raised the bar on these books to a level that Ridgeway could not have known in 1978, &quot;The Last Step&quot; is a good and exciting read, especially when combined with Rowell's classic.   Ridgeway is a good climbing writer with a sharp eye
