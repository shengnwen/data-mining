Not just a girl meets boy, they court, they fight, they fall in love story. There is a bit of mystery. There is a bit of history about the
ill-fated writer of Peyton Place, Grace Metalious. There are 
family dynamics and small town dynamics. An interesting storyline about the hazards of mercury that exists today.
A wee bit slow to start, but soon finds a rythm and finishes very nicely. 
The lead, Annie, is a uniquely written character. A bit of an odd-ball.
I liked her voice.
From cover to cover, I enjoyed it quite a lot.  
One side note that is not about Delinsky. What is with these new format paperbacks that cost 2.00 more? They aren't easier to read than
 a regular size mass market. That is two in a row that Delinsky's house has published this way. Geesh new paperbacks are expensive enough
