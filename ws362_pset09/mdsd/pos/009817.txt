Although Persuasion is generally overshadowed by Jane Austen's more well-known novel, Pride and Prejudice, this is a beautifully written, poignant love story about the strength and endurance of love. Anne receives a proposal she very much wants to accept but is discouraged by a friend of the family who is advising her in the place of Anne's deceased mother. Anne listens, breaks off the relationship, and then regrets her decision. She turns down at least one other proposal that we know of (Charles, who later marries her sister) because she still hasn't gotten over her love for Wentworth. Through a series of coincidences, Anne meets her beau again eight years later and the spark is still there although they both try to keep their feelings hidden. They finally acknowledge their love for each other and ignore the protests of friends and family who would keep them apart. There's a very interesting discussion between the characters in the book about who keeps love alive the longest in the absence of the one they love -- men or women. If you haven't tried this one yet, I think you'll find it very satisfying
