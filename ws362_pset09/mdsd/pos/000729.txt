this book includes all kinds of useful information that is not necessarily specific to documentary, although that is it's focus.  there's excercises in here to help develop ideas into a filmic narrative, ethics, how to tackle an interview as well as subject matter.  i've read a lot of film books, and i have to say, this is not only well written with a sense of humor and wit, it deals with potential situations in a down to earth way.   The information provided is not just technical, but also how to approach an emotional situation, gain the trust of your participants, and address multiple points of view.
