What makes this book so useful is the preponderance of excellent illustrations! This book very clearly illustrates where the user should focus on the Elements' tool bars, option bars, menues, screens, etc. 

Few of us can always remember the exact meaning of these titled functions while we read the words that describe the required actions. The detailed illustrations in this book make me much more productive during the learning process
