My 9 year old, 4th grader, recently read The Journal of Scott Pendleton Collins for a book report.  He is not much on reading, and it is difficult to find books that hold his attention.  The book, although a little sad, was exiting and interesting.  He really enjoyed it and did a great job on the book report!
