I own this book, and even though i'm not planning on being a comic book artist, it helps me alot with my proportions, perspective, action posese and just plain getting things right. It's also a great book for simple shading and stuff like that. only draw back is that his art isn't always  ok. He's best at his comic book characters though, and it's obvious if you look at any of his other how to draw books
