This book tells the tale of a young marine toxicologist who discovers a sunken WWII sub chaser in the lagoon of a Pacific atoll where he is studying the local fauna. It seems the island  is covered by a "taboo" in local legend that keeps people away not just from the island, but also the immediate area. While this causes some problems, the trouble really starts when the subchaser is uncovered by a typhoon that washes away much of the sandy bottom of the lagoon. There is something on the sunken subchaser that people are willing to kill for. 

It is in many ways this book is classic Robb White. A young man (early 20s) on his own, sunken treasue, sailing, and a bit of WWII intrigue thrown in. Not his very best work in my opinion, but certianly enjoyable and well written. The characters are fairly well developed, and the plot consistent, with a few very nice twists. It felt a lot like "Secret Sea" in many ways, just aimed at a bit older audience.

I read many of White's books as a "pre-teen" but never read this one, as I could never find it. I ran across it at our local library, and was happily surprised how enjoyable it was reading a "new" White book as an adult. Like most Robb White books in this day and age, it will be hard to find (not as hard as some of the early ones tho), but its worth a look if you liked his other works.
