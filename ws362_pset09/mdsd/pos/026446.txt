This book is very well written and easy to read. The author uses intelligent wording/language and teaches through interesting stories. If you are a player who is easily frustrated you should read this book to help you calm your mind when you play tennis. Even a player who is normally quiet should use this book as a tool to stay even more focused. Don't be thrown off my the author's 'laiser faire' attitude towards winning tennis games; the real kick is in the last couple chapters when he talks about why it's important to win. Great book, I will read it again
