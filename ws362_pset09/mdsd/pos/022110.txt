This book is great for all teenagers. I read this book over last summer and it is about a boy named Paul Logan who was born under a white man and an african-american women. Since he is half-black he still has to deal with racism.

Paul Logan's main dream is one that is very unique and not like many kids' dreams these days. All he wants to do is own some land for himself and his family. He works hard and deals with racism. He has a great friend named Mitchel who helps him and is a major charcter in the book!

This book by Mildred D. Taylor was an awesome book that I, as a teenager, suggest to all young adults! Great Book! I hope my review was helpful to you
