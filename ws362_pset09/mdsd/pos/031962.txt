This book (a series of nine essays) moves a bit slow, but the pacing is perfect for the style of writing.  The essays were on nature, the definition and impact of nature, and instead of vitriolic bashing of human's interaction with nature, Snyder shows that we could live in harmony with our sacred places.  I reccommend you read the essays one at a time, and take your time with them.  They really make you think about how each culture interacts with the region they are in, and how sometimes we do take our relationship to the wild the wrong way. It is both poetic, and scientific, the perfect education
