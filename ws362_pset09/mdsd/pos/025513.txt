Currently, I am writing an important A Level coursework essay on the effectiveness of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. This book is A BIBLE! Compared to other books, Leuchtenburg actually lists all his sources to the tiniest detail i.e. page which is really really good when you are trying to suggest you are using a wide range of sources. I would give this book 5 stars. The other book I was recommended was Anthony J. Badger 'The New Deal' it's good.. but nothing in comparisson, this book is much more helpful - a definate yes
