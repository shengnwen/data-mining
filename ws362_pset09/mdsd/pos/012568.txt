Many, many great ideas in this book.  Simply excellent.  I have given this book to other business owners as gifts.  One of my favorite sections is about PITAs (Pain in the Ass Customers).  When you fire 3 of your PITA customers, you will receive many, many new good customers to replace the fired ones.  He explains how this works in this book.  Many other eye opening ideas and observations.  You must buy this book.  You will read it and re-read it many times over
