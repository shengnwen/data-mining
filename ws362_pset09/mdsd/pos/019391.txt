This book was first published in 1986, with the 2nd edition coming out in 1993. I bought and read this book in 2005. I found it very informative with great ideas for running a bar. More importantly, it goes into detail on how to write a business plan, partnerships, investors and etc. Basically all the 'business' stuff that goes behind opening and running a bar. Despite the book being old, the basics are all in there and will work today. However I also feel that in today's world, there are other things that the book does not implement. Things like the internet and wider use of PCs, which I think has greatly altered the way busineses work
