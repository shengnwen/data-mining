It is well worth his proof that we can only be certain of uncertainty, our thinking self via Cogito Ergo Sum.

When reading Descartes, I often become fascinated with ideas that he did not intend to be major areas of concern, but were nonetheless a direct result of topics he spoke.  This happens quite a bit in the Sixth Meditation.  A great companion for Descartes, in explicating and refuting his thought, is Thomson's DESCARTES TO KANT, which serves the whole of modern philosophy as well.  Move from here to Hume or Kant
