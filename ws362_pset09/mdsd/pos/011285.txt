The value of "Jesus, Life Coach" all depends on what you're looking for.  If you are a career woman looking for a devotional book full of interesting stories and practical life application you are going to be thrilled with this one.  

If you are searching for a guidebook to assist you in coaching people or nuts and bolts instruction on life skills development, you are going to be very disappointed.   

I was looking for the later but have based my rating on the former.  Laurie Beth Jones proves to be a very good devotional writer for today's Christian career woman.
