The book was good, except for the fact that it was very dark and dragged on in some parts.  I think that the author could've let the demon posess people without them dying and getting blood everywhere.  This book would be for kids about 9 - 14, but with some of the plot twists which are somewhat difficult to follow, and the nastiness of some of the deaths, I'd say 12 - 14
