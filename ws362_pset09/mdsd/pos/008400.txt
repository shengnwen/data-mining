Poor ol' Robert Crumb, reluctantly labeled father of the underground comic movement has moved to France with his lovely, comely and protectant wife.  
These conversations help the reader get into Crumb's head. They give an autobiographical and historical perspective of Crumb, from his harsh family atmosphere to when he escaped from a greeting card company to find the summer of love in California.  
Many have been offended by what he has produced. He is an artist and as an artist he does what he is supposed to do; make you look at the (our) world in a different way.  
These conversations give the reader the opportunity to be an auteur into the artistic psyche. Whether you believe Crumb is an artist or not, he was there; he saw, he came (in more ways than one) and he went away.  It's a fascinating read and brings you closer to him.  (It is impossible to meet him. Don't bother him in France and he no longer does any tours/talks-too busy drawing!)
It is worth it to have reviewed or be familiar with some of his comic work if you have not done so already. (Where have you been?) There are many sources on the Internet as well as published to accomplish this. 
These conversations begin in the 60's and break into the 21st Century. I look forward to the next conversations, if he allows them.
