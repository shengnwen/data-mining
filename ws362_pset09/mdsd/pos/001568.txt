Konik is the same guy on all the poker televsion shows. He obviously has a lot of connections in the gambling world which gives him great stories to tell. There's all sorts of entertaining stuff to amuse you in this collection. I like the stories about greyhound racing (laugh out loud funny) and the ones about playing the World Series of Poker. This is a must for anyone who likes gambling stories
