I really need to read these in order. When I said Alex comes close to death in Survival of the Fittest I hadn't read this yet - he comes sooooo much closer in this one. And Milo is right there with him. In fact, the poor detective takes quite a beating.

Okay, it all begins with a sniper incident at a grade school. The kids are traumatized and Detective Milo Sturgis calls in his friend Dr. Alex Delaware to help the little ones cope. When politics get involved, everything goes downhill. Kinky politicos, fugitive left wing radicals, neo nazis - it's all here. Add one demented little father on the war path and we have the makings of one dangerous situation. Into which, poor Milo and Alex walk blind.

Alex and Robin are still separated in this one and she really irritates me. She dumped him and now she keeps calling him, wanting to be friends and just picking at old wounds. Alex has a great new love interest now - Linda, the school principal. I really like her. I wish she would stick around.

And, yes, another sleepless night reading this - lots of tension, lots of angst - lots of frantic page turning to find out what happens next
