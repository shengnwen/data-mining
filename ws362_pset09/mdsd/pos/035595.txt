The Lincoln Lawyer is hilariously and profoundly true.  If you ever wanted to know what it is like to be a high-powered criminal attorney, this book will show you.  I am a civil attorney, myself, and this novel opened the door into the grimy other world of criminal law.  (Not that civil trial law is without its warts either.)

Put simply, this novel is about "The Client From Hell."  Every lawyer has had one at one time or another, but not like this.  Connelly's depiction of the protagonist's slow descent into you-know-where is engrossing, hilarious, and true-to-life.  The only bad thing about this novel is that it might discourage some readers from a career in law.  Or maybe it will encourage others.  Hard to say.  What I can say is that this is a well-written and engrossing novel that I could not put down until the final moment.  That is high praise indeed.

This is a remarkably well-written novel that keeps the reader guessing until the very last minute.  You will come to know and care about the characters in this novel.  Not only is the plot in this novel interesting and even engrossing, but (unlike a John Grisham novel) the characters are true-to-life as well.  This novel rings with authenticity.

This is my first Michael Connelly novel, but it will not be the last; not by any means.  This one is highly recommended
