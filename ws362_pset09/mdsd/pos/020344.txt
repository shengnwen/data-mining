This is a funny book. It's also the most difficult to read since Maribou Stork Nightmares. Welsh uses more tricks and interruptions in this book than in most. You never forget that you are reading a book. Welsh is known for his good taste in music and occasional DJing himself. In this book the main character likes so much bad music like Phil Collins, Michael Bolton, and hair metal. It reminds me of American Psycho
