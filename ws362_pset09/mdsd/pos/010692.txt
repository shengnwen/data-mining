As a current volunteer I also read this book to prepare for my service.  Looking back on it now a lot of the questions are outdated and no longer relevant.  Take for instance riding motorcycles.  From what I have gathered  no one in the Peace Corps is allowed to even ride on a motorcycle as even a passenger.

I also wanted to use this as a forum for potential volunteers.  It is true that you will get a wide range of answers and generalizations from volunteers and recruiters.  This is because no experience is the same and they genuinely do not want to mislead you.

I would look to see if this book is available in the library.  If you are to become a volunteer start saving money now.  It is worth so much more wherever you end up going.  Also try to e-mail a volunteer that is currently in your country/region.  They will be ab le to give you the best advice as to what you will and won't need.  Also ask them what kind of language materials you should get prior to arrival.

Anyone that knows they are going to Thailand can feel free to contact me.
