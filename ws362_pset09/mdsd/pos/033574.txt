The author does a great job of presenting a complicated subject in an easy to grasp step by step method. Dr. Liang obviously understand how to both teach and educate at the same time. I found this book through a formal class, but we only covered a subset of the chapters. I took the book and finished on my own. The book is that well structured and written. As a pleasant side note, it also contains zero errors that I could find, contrary to may software books.

I've read a number of books teaching programming languages and this ranks as one of the best I've found!
