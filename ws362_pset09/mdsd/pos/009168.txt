Wow, what a book!  In my opinion, considerably better than the movie.  Particularly the first 80 pages are very, very strong.  Crichton's technique of repeatedly shifting points of view -- from the doctor in the Costa Rican jungle, to the vacationing family, to one biologist, to another, and eventually to our heros, Sattler and Grant, and then Malcolm etc -- is tremendously effective.  Normally this would be confusing but somehow he pulls it off.  We can all smell what's coming -- dinosaurs! - and yet we want to see it!  We need to see it!

I agree that the characters here are weak, which I find rather baffling from so talented a writer.  It's quite upsetting really.  That said, because the science and suspense are so well done, I got over it.  

The level of detail in the book is what makes it special.  Not just the dinosaurs, but the plants, the intricacies of Ingen and corporate patent law, etc are all very well done.  Some of the plot elements - the total failure of the park, Nedry's ability to control it while no one can do anything, the total absensce of any weapons, etc - are ridiculous, but again, because the elements of supsense and wonder are so powerful, and so well done, the book works HUGE.  I enjoyed the movie quite a bit as well but this novel is just superior.  Right now.  Today.  Everyone should read it!
