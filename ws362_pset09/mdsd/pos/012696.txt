 This along with My System is one of the all time best selling chess books. Writing a review of this book is almost like trying to review the Holy Bible.
  
   Someone gave me an extremely old edition of this book because they knew I enjoyed chess. I not only enjoy playing chess but I also collect chess books. I have many rare and out of print books. As soon as I saw the title I recognized this book as one of the all time classics. The great condition and yellowing pages of this original edition also made me smile. At the time I first read the book I was not rated high enough to fully understand it. If you are not rated at least 1900 then you should be reading a chess tactics puzzle book or something along those lines. Chess is 95% tactics but when you are ready to learn the strategic and positional side of chess then you are ready for this book. I am still not good enough to say I understand everything in this book. If you want an easy to read book then this is not the book. If you want a book with ideas and techniques that are easy to grasp than this is not your book. If you are about to reach Master level (or collect classic chess books) than this is the book for you.
