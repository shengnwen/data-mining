It is interesting to find that those who didn't like the book, were in fact criticizing the author--with whom I'm sure they do not have a personal relationship.  Those who disagree with the teachings of the church Hinckley belongs to will stop at nothing convince others of their own feelings--even review a harmless book by the church's leader.  I find it petty and even arrogant.  

The book itself is an easy read.  I find it refreshing to read a book that espouses "old-fashioned" values that society seems to so casually discard.  Indeed, if more people were to "Stand For Something"--anything at all, instead of blowing wherever the wind takes them, we would enjoy a much more responsible and respectful society.  I applaud the author for sharing his stories and ideas with mainstream America.
