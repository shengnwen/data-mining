If you want to understand Iraq, or war in the modern age in general, I think you must read this book.  Most wars are simply unwinnable -- as that term is commonly misunderstood in Hollywood terms.  WWI and WWII were the exceptions not the rule.  Where an when you must fight an unwinnable war, it must be by necessity and with a clearly defined objective and exit strategy.  This book illustrates these lessons vividly through the life, courage and devotion of a little known and less understood and altogether mystifying and facinating true American hero.  Even if you are not so interested in the politics and the present day relevance, it's still one great read
