We read the gushing Robert M. Parker Jr. quote on the cover, &quot;A terrific and candid guide to the wines of Italy that should be on the bookshelves of all wine lovers.&quot; and knew we just HAD to have this book.  Vino Italiano is written by &quot;Mario Eats Italy&quot; Batali's partner (Mr. Bastianich) and a former senior editor of Wine &amp; Spirits magazine (David Lynch).  These guys are serious wine buffs.  But it's all tempered by a bit of fun injected by Batali, who along with Lidia Bastianich (Joseph's mom) contributed the recipes at the end of each chapter.  These folks truly understand Italian wine is, after all, meant to be consumed with food!  There's more here than you may ever want to know, but the book is a success on many levels for many people, from the barely curious to the Italian wine lover.  Although they try to write about all the wines from Italy, they suggest (and furnish information on importers) tastings of wines that are available in the US.  We highly recommend this book as well as TCI's The Italian Wine Guide.  Larry Theobald, CycleItalia www.cycleitalia.co
