My daughter, who is in the first grade, is reading at the fourth or fifth grade level. She could read before she turned four, and I think a big part of that was this book. We had the old, politically incorrect version, and we literally read it to pieces. Now I'm ordering for my niece, who just turned one. This book is a great vocabulary builder for little ones. One word of warning: after the five hundredth reading it gets a little old for the adults, but it is a great book for learning vocabulary and spelling of everyday words
