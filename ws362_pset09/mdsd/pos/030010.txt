I like the book.  I like the way Hugh Greer paints and I would like to go out and do likewise.  The beginning starts out with full explanation - then he gives you ways to use what he wants to teach you - but he does it with very complicated examples and not much explanation.  He skips a lot of steps.  I am still trying some of his ideas and hope that I can learn them because I really like his results.  This book is much, much more helpful if you get his DVDs, he has three -first is very basic, but the next two go a long way to explaining some of the steps he left out.
