so i was going through reviews of anne coulter's latest book, and there was a five star review that i found to be quite hilarious.  he commented on coulter's amazing prose and her impeccable research.  he then pointed out that she had pages of footnotes, pages and pages of footnotes...that literally made me laugh out loud.  you know who i don't like, anne coulter!  i love that franken is able to make me laugh by simply giving me the facts.
