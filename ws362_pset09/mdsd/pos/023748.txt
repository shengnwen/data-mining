Arnie Cunningham is a high school geek. He has glasses, pimples, controlling parents, and no girls until he meets up with Christine.  Christine is a 1958 Plymouth Sport Fury that Arnie finds, and is immediately attracted to her. Christine gets fixed up by Arnie and Arnie gets some attention.(his first girlfriend).  As Christine starts putting her spell on Arnie, he loses touch with the things that matter most like family, school and his friends. Arnie gets deeply entranced by Christine and uses her as a tool to get back at people her were not so nice to him.  Arnie and Christine turn into a Thelma and Louise and go on a killing spree. Arnie, in turn, loses everything, his friends, Christine, and his life.

My Thoughts:  Christine is one of my favorite reads. I love the storyline, because it is mostly believable. This young nerd gets a cool car and everybody starts liking him. This is believable! Then he gets a big head and people start disliking him!(also believable) When Arnie falls under Christines spell, it is most exciting to me. I relate to Arnie in the aspect of time and love he put into Christine, something that every car lover does. When Christine turns into a killer and fixes herself,the story gets supernatural. I like how Christine is displayed with feelings of jealousy, which gives this car a personable image.  Overall, I feel this book is a great read for anyone with a desire for an ultimate twist
