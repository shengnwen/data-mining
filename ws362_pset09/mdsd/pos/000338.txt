Other people have covered the technical details of the book sufficiently. I'll just say that I consider Simmons to be a masterful storyteller, and that I'll buy anything he writes.  I was hooked from the Hyperion series, was delighted to hear of Ilium, and I wasn't let down in the slightest.  He uses the classic approach of starting in the "middle" of the story, but rather than simply spoon-feeding the back story, he excels at tantalizing the reader with selective details, and allowing you to slowly refine your picture of his universe in your imagination as the story unfolds.  This and the sequel Olympos are just amazing in so many ways
