"ChiWalking:  The Five Mindful Steps for Lifelong Health and Energy" is a life-changing book for a walker.  ChiWalking is essentially a way of using the body's energy system to maximize your walking experience.  This encompasses a variety of things, from the form or posture you use when walking, to how you move, to what you think of or meditate on or focus on, and much more.  

Before I started ChiWalking, I had a lot of pain in my left hip.  Since learning the ChiWalking technique, I have no more hip pain.  

However, I availed myself of much more than just the ChiWalking book.  I started with the book, and thus understood what I needed to do and why.  I am not very good at translating something from a book to action, so I wasn't able to duplicate the movements on my own from just the book alone.  I would not blame this on the book, however, because the book is very clear, and would be really beneficial for those readers who can pick up mechanical movements from illustrations and exposition.  I then purchased the ChiWalking DVD, which helped a lot.  I saw people practicing what I had read about in the book.  Still, I could not translate that into action, mainly because of my learning limitations.  However, it excited me and motivated me to take a ChiWalking seminar in a nearby large city.  In the seminar I received feedback as to what I was doing wrong.  This was what was most helpful to me.  Without the book, however, I would not have had the background to fully implement the instruction I received or to really incorporate it into my walking practice.  

The ChiWalking book thoroughly explains theory and practice behind ChiWalking.  It is where you should start to find out if ChiWalking can help you to be a better walker.  It explains all steps, skills, technique, how to design a personal program, variations such as hiking, off-road walking, and treadmill walking, plus various specially designed walks to develop your "chi" or overall energy.  

If you love to walk, you should own this book.  If you want to walk, but have had problems doing so, you should own this book.  Even if you just implement the proper form in your walking, you will benefit from reading "ChiWalking".  If you are intrigued at all by the idea of your personal energy system and walking, I would highly recommend this book.
