Be forewarned. Even if you have read a lot of Shakespeare's plays, this  one is difficult and demands much effort to follow. But, if you can push yourself into reading this, it is well worth the time. Shakespeare himself  performed the role of Berowne. While this is a comedy, the humour relies on  irony as opposed to funny events. Also, unlike his other comedies, this one  does not end in utter happieness. The interaction of the characters, as  well as the situation comedy (especially in 4.3) is quite memorable. This  comedy differs significantly from most of his others, but it is a wonderful  piece of literature
