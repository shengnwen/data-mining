1.  This book is about a little girl, Ellie, who is 8 years old and her family don't really talk at her, they barely talk to each other.  She is the only girl out of all of her sisters who has blue eyes and blonde hair, she's the cutest of all of them. The one thing she doesn't like about herself is her teeth because they're starting to get rotten.  Her parents don't really take good care of her, her dad, Okey, drinks alot because he lost his job and got real upset over it.  Her mother mainly just makes supper for them.  One day her dad gets a hunting dog,Bullet, and Ellie was confused because her dad can't hunt because he has a hurt arm and can't use it very good.  Ellie told her daddy that she wanted to go hunting, so they did. She was a really good shooter.  Ellie didn't really have no friends, except for one, Carolyn, she was the best friend she ever had.  They did everything togeter, but when Ellie goes to Carolyn's house, something happened to Ellie that never happened before.  A few days later something else happened to Ellie's dad and she was scare that he would die because of what happened.
2.  I think this is a really good book because it's really sad and it makes me feel really sorry for her and I just couldn't stop reading it.
3.  There is alot of protagonism in here because it's all about Ellie and her life.
4.  I recommend this book to people who like to read realistic books because what all has happened in Ellie's life could happen to someone in real life
