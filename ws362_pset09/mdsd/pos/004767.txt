I spent the last 3 weeks with this book working through it page by page, and agree with readers who both praised the book for its comprehensiveness and how its presentation was at times confusing.  I would go so far as to say that some examples were downright frustrating by their lack of clear explanation.  But this was the exception rather than the rule.  If you're new to Illustrator (Photoshop experience will help), this book will take you to the point where you feel somewhat proficient if you work through the many examples
