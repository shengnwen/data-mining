I read this book years ago. It still sticks in my mind how much good I got out of it.
In life we have to go through many storms, not weather related, but tests and trials of the enemy. Instead of trying to get out of it, she tells about how she conquered her fears by not running away from them, but running right into them.
When you do that they disperse. It reminds me of geese. They are very aggressive and if you allow them they will try to back you down, but if you run through them and swing your arms they will move out of your way and instead of you bring intimidated, they will disperse and move out of the way. You are in control and not them.
Something most of us need to know when we are facing the storms of life. 
God tells us in James 1:2-4 Amplified Version 

2 Consider it wholly joyful, my brethren, whenever you are enveloped in or encounter trials of any sort or fall into various temptations.   3 Be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your faith bring out endurance and steadfastness and patience.
4 But let endurance and steadfastness and patience have full play and do a thorough work, so that you may be [people] perfectly and fully developed [with no defects], lacking in nothing.

This is what the book is about. I loved the book when I read it, and I highly recommend this book to anyone who has fears of any kind because she points you in the right direction to Jesus who showed her what to do about her fears
