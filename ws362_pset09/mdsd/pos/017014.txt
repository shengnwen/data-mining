Toni Morrison were letting the youth know about, people with amazing collection of losers and fighters, innocents and murders, followers of ghosts and followers of money, all of whom add to the pleasure of this exceptionally diverse novel. When Toni was a little girl she was raised in a bad neiborhood. Toni was scared to come out side the house because of the dangerous surroundings around here. Toni had a miserable life. She listened to stories from her friends about them getting raped and abused by their parents. She was very scared of her father as a young child.
	I like this book because it's a good example about a freighting childhood inside of a bad neiborhood. I was raised in a bad nationhood but I wasn't scared of nothing I was very brave. She teaches our youth today to watch your surroundings. If you read this boot you would be like what a child life. You would never want to put your feet in her shoes.
