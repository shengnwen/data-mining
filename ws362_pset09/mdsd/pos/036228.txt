On the 30th anniversary of the 1st lunar landing, it was refreshing to read an account of the space race that looks past the heroics of manned space flight into the real dynamics of space exploration - the cold war and the internecing politics that fueled both civilian and military applications for spaceflight technologies.  Beginning in the early 20th century and progressing with wartime Germany's co-opting of rocket science, we see a hobby for dilettantes become a mortally serios scientific endaevor.  America's efforts, long considered lackluster throuought the war, had progressed far enough by its end to have surpassed the work of Robert Goddard, America's homegrown rocket-visionary.  Progressing through the cold-war, overcoming Eisenhower's warnings of the big government needed to run both warlike and peaceful space efforts, the space race accelerates the pace of military technology and the military-industril complex, even as the US gov't strives to present civilian applications for rockets - manned exploration and satellites.  As comprehensive a work as this, the author sometimes swamped by his own history.  That the author can display a definite bias against manned spaceflight seems less a black mark against this heavy tome than a reminder that he has reoriented himself.  A heavy work you'll have to read over and over
