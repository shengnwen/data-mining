With 317 prior reviews for this book, I'll keep this one short and sweet. I checked out the 5 hour abridged audio version of this book from the library on a whim not knowing quite what to expect. It was terrific. The Price of Loyalty provides insight into the inner workings and decision making process of the Bush administration through the recollections of former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. If you value thoughtful, considered decision making driven primarily by facts and process, you won't find the picture painted by O'Neill very pretty. O'Neill's first private meeting with President Bush is a real eye-opener. Suffice it to say, he didn't find an inquisitive, engaged and informed individual.

O'Neill recounts how he quickly ran headlong into the reality of a defacto inner and outer circle among the Bush administration senior officials and cabinet members. O'Neill was, by his own admission, in the outer circle. While there was the occasional exception, in many meetings the outcome was pre-ordained by the inner circle - discussion and debate was either discouraged or of no consequence. Some of these pre-decided decisions were real whoppers, most notably steering the topic of one of the first meetings O'Neill attended to the need to invade Iraq and topple Hussein. There were even maps of Iraq handy, complete with the location of current and potential future Iraqi oil fields. I kid you not - you can't make this stuff up because no one would believe you.

I don't know much about O'Neill, but he certainly comes across as a credible, principled person. In other words, his story rings true and, even though it's a couple years old, is well worth reading
