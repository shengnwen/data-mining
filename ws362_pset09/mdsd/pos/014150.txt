I got this book as a Christmas present and devoured it!
This is the story of a young girl and her family as they
struggle against a vicious and untreated mental illness
in the mother. It is the most lovely and heartbreaking (not
to mention realistic) portrayal of what happens to families
with a chronically psychotic member that I have ever read.
It belongs on the top shelf of psychiatric-memoir classics with
Kay Jamison's Unquiet Mind and Kaysen's Girl Interrupted.
It is a haunting and moving account. I think this would make for 
a phenomenal film. Perhaps with Julia Roberts with dark hair
as the amazing mother
