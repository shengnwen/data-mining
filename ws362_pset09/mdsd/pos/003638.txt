Maggie Jackson has written an original and thought-provoking book brimming with insightful observations. In her extensive research she has both hunted down the extremes of combining work and home and acknowledged her own personal, more typical, odyssey. This is a book to pick up when your spouse is complaining about your Blackberry usage at 11 pm on Saturday night, and when your kids make those heart-rending comments about missing you when you're traveling. It helps put our crazy lives into perspective and provides ideas on what we can do to prevent work creep. Jackson seems a natural for this topic, having studied and written about this subject for many years. With a dearth of good books addressing work/family issues, this book is a winner
