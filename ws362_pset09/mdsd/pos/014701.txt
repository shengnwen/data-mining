This book is a compilation of philosophical/spiritual/theological thought from a wide variety of teachers in the context of the spiritual dimensions of sexuality.  The editor's premise is that sex is sacred.  

Ms. Gendreau draws on the wisdom of numerous religious traditions--Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Jewish, as well as psychological and sociological models.  The book presents a wealth of relationship knowledge all in one place and can be an extremely useful resource to those who wish to learn more and improve their interactions with others.

I note, however, that some of the chapters do not seem to have anything or much to say about sexuality, for example Scott Peck, Francine Ward, Wayne Dyer and Gloria Jean to name a few. They are rather more about traditional approaches to interpersonal dealings. This is not to take away from their value, but I do question their relevance to the book's intent.

Nevertheless, I think this is an excellent anthology, a valuable collection of wise words and ideas.  

Margot Anand proposes a thought that was completely new to me and one I find intriguing.  She says that, "Orgasm brings us closer to the divine than any other experience . . .a bonding happens between the right and left hemispheres of the brain. . .The ego disappears, time and space cease to exist and you become one with energy and consciousness.  This is the sacred dimension of sex."  I think her chapter in "The Marriage of Sex and Spirit" was one of the best in relationship to the book's stated intent
