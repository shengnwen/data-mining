And in a big way. With a mysterious Jack and Jill killing high profile celeberties, Alex Cross also has a killer on the lose who is targeting children that attend his very own son's school! With direct threats made to the president.. he is pulled to work on a team of others to find Jack and Jill. 
This book was very good. A little slower then the first two, but all in all a great book with surprises hidden within each chapter. Just when you think you have it all figured out... think again. Highly recommend
