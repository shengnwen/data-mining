This is a very useful book if you have a problem, or even think you might, with regard to compulsively searching for and/or using internet porn, chat rooms, etc.

I would also like to mention, in light of the fact that one of the authors, David Delmonico,Ph.D., lives here in Pittsburgh, that there is an active SLAA (Sex & Love Addicts Anonymous) that can help individuals break this addiction and find a new, happier, healthier way of living. It can be contacted through http://www.wpa-slaa.org

Readers in other areas can contact Fellowship Wide Services at [...]

To everyone reading this now, I'd just like to leave with the thought that life CAN get better. And you don't have to try and change for the rest of your life. You only have to try to do better for today...
