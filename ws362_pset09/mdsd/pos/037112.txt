I was impressed with this book's variety of recipes and cooking ideas.  Although I haven't done many recipes, just reading about the foods that can be made with flax seed have led me to be more creative in using flax seed in recipes (like salads and oatmeal).  My family likes the bread recipes of this book the most.  Most importantly, it's a small jump from reading this book to acting on it the information you learn inside
