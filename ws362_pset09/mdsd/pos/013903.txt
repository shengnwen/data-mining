Peter Mitchell delivers a powerful novel of human relationships from the perspective of a boy who lives in a small town in England during the 1980's.  The story of a talented 13-year-old poet who is brutalized by his peers for his stammer grips the reader in its gorgeous narrative and poignant observations.   This passionate young man must hide his talent and his feelings in a peer culture that celebrates brutality and domination.  

The young man develops and grows in this environment despite the stultifying peer culture and at one point observes that "The world's a headmaster that works on your faults."   

Mitchell is a fortunate find.  His talent for plot and language are vast and create an enjoyable and entertaining experience.   Highly recommended
