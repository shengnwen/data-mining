This is a superb way to duplicate some of your favorite snack items like Cinnabon CinnabonStix , KFC Honey BBQ Wings, and Cheese Nips. I've tried several recipes and all of them came out great.
The Boston Market Meatloaf, one of my favorite take-out foods, was right on the money. I also recreated Cheese Nips and got them to taste just like the original, though the color was off slightly. The KFC wings were perfect and delicious (as is his cloned recipe of KFC original recipe chicken in an earlier boook). The recipe for Devil Dogs came out as dry as the actual Devil Dogs you can get in a store. So I made a few slight changes and produced a wonderfully moist version. They're also good with a chocolate glaze and/or a chocolate cream filling. 
That's one of the reasons why people want to have these recipes even though you can buy most of these products quite easily. We like to make slight changes or additions that make them more fun. I've made Twinkies with a ton of different fillings, extra-large thin mints, Cinnabon buns with chocolate chips, and a host of other personal variations of popular dishes. It's for cooks who like to have fun. I recommend this highly, along with all of his other books.
