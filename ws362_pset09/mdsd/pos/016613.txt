For me, this is not Sheldon's best effort, if only because Jennifer Parker, the main character, suffers from a lack of a life - and this is largely her life story.  Still, even a book that's not his best is a very good book anyway!

Jennifer Parker passed the New York Bar Exam the first time.  From there, it was going to be all good.  She had a job working for the NY District Attorney, Robert Di Silva, and the idealistic outlook of a go-getter young lawyer.  And then, suddenly, it appeared to be over - her law career was finished a mere four hours after it began.  She had sat in the courtroom on one case, and that case would define the rest of her life.  Jennifer was made a pawn by Michael Moretti, a Mafia don.  That earned her the lifelong hatred of D.A. Di Silva and, eventually, the lifelong love of Adam Warner.   

The twists and turns Jennifer takes are made plausible, which is a storytelling feat.  From defending the poor for nothing to defending the Mafia is a leap, but Sheldon pulled that off.  What bothered me is that, as I said before, brilliant and beautiful Jennifer, has no life.  She has no family, one friend and a career.  This, apparently, explains how this high profile, somewhat notorious lawyer is able to have a child and keep his existence secret from pretty much everyone for seven years.  Even less realistic than that is the last chapter, but I hate to spoil it for anyone!  I'll just say it's amazing to me that she's living as Jennifer Parker, free woman, anywhere in the U.S.  The nitpicking aside, Sheldon is always worth reading
