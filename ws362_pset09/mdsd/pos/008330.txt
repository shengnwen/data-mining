I thought I'd read everything Hemingway ever published, but I was not even familiar with this one.  When I read that it was a parody, I thought I might not get it, since it had been a long time since I'd read any of the  authors he was targeting.  Instead I found myself laughing out loud. So  much reminded me of best-sellers I had read in recent years(The Bridges of  Madison County is one which comes to mind).  It just goes to show, great  writing can come in many styles, but bad writing remains amazingly  consistant over the years
