this book was recommended to me by a patient who struggled with self-injurious behavior. i thank him to this day and have recommended the book to numerous patients and parents of adolescents who self-mutilate. this book is a graphic and eye-opening depiction of the epidemic that self-mutilation has become. notions of self-injury as strictly "attention seeking" are outdated, and this book explores the origins of self-mutilation, its reinforcing value for the injurer, and ways in which sufferers have conquered this seemingly compulsive behavior. it's also a great resource for friends and family members of those who self-injure, as it sheds some light on the inner workings of these individuals and can, thereby, create increased understanding and empathy for the psychological and emotional struggles that underlie self-mutilation. though self-mutilation can be seen as a very primitive behavior, it's expression can be very complicated and not easily understood by those who have never felt such intense emotionality. this is a highly recommended read. as others have noted, however, this book is not for the faint of heart. i also appreciated conterio and lader's book entitled *bodily harm: the breakthrough healing program for self-injurers.
