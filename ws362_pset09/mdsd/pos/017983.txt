If you're in the business of selling...or in business and need to sell...this book is going to be crucial in terms of how you engage your potential customers and clients.  I should tell you upfront, this process is focused on building relationships, not getting the order.

It's loaded with details and examples and "workshops" to conduct on your own.  That said, there are times when it's almost too much, and I cannot imagine being able to remember half of the items they recommend.

So, if you're the type of salesperson I can't stand, just focusing on getting the deal done, rather than finding out where you can...and cannot...add value, then this is not the book for you.  You need to go to their workshops and get some sort of intervention.

In fact, I used one of their tactics the other day on a salesperson who called me to tell me how great his product was, what a great opportunity it was for me, etc., etc.  I simply said, "Really?  Which of the two needs that I'm focused on right now do you think it fills?"

Of course, given that he hadn't actually asked me about what my needs were, he was rather taken aback...before he hung up on me.

Made my day....
