I consider myself an eco- liberal- sex-positive feminist, and Ariel takes a stance against the sex-positive feminist culture in this book. So why did I give it a 5? Because I totally agree with her. Here's why.

1) Being sex-positive does not mean being a sl*t; being a sex-positive feminist should mean taking personal control of your sexuality for what feels good to you, and not being a sex toy to men (unless that's really your thing)
2) The game of turning women away from feminism through corporate culture and media hype is pretty obvious
3) The heartbreaking look at today's female youth and the glorification of what you see in gangsta rap and hip hop videos infected across the country in a festival of a**-shaking demeaning behaviour (please note I personally use the Gangsta rap as a source, Ariel did not, as I feel it is a main contributor to mainly white kids seeking to imitate that "culture" - this is not a racist remark - it is a simple sociological observation)

Now, as I said, I'm fairly liberal, more a moderate, and Ariel's argument is very dead-on. I expected to go into this book arguing with the pages against why women shouldn't be sexually oppressed and I just found myself nodding.  Her case is very logical and clear, and I very much respect her non-abrasive style. I look forward to other writings.

Please, do yourself a favour and read this, then give it to your daughters and sisters. And I encourage the men to read it as well. This isn't feminazi male-bashing. 

I really hope that women will remember the power of their minds over their  plastic surgery, media-driven bodies after reading this, and also realize how they are really hurting themselves and future generations
