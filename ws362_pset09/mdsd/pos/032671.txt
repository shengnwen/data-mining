An impressive work.  I enjoy encountering an author that is confident enough to leave the reader to explore the world of his (or her) creation without a map.  And what a world McDonald creates...  Set primarily in the India of the not-so-distant future, the author masterfully plays our unfamiliarity with Indian culture against our unfamiliarity with the future he creates.  The author's skill is evident in the manner whereby our discovery of both the old (Indian Culture) and the new (the future of 2047) progress on roughly the same time frame.  On one level the book can be read as a mystery complete with a hardcore police officer out to save the world and bad guys straight out of central casting.  On another it is a Stephensoneque ramble about power politics, computer hacking, mass media and the effects of technological and environmental changes upon society.  On even another level "River of Gods" is a speculation on the nature of intelligence and the universe worthy of Arthur C. Clarke.  Though at times a bit confusing--the author pulls it off and at the end of the book you realize that the themes were infinitely more vast than originally suspected.  Much of the pleasure of reading this book is having the disparate thematic threads resolve into a very satisfying whole--the effort demanded of the reader in keeping track of the various plots and subplots is very richly rewarded
