Without trying to repeat what has already been said, A.R. comes alive in reading this book.  He really didn't have many friends, just business associates.  His life was all business and that business was making money!  He was the ultimate gambler seeing an opening and taking it (no matter who you were - family, friend or foe).  A.R. was involved in all types of scams, legitimate and illegal, for the sole purpose of turning a profit. After reading this book - you also find out a few undesirable traits about A.R. such as him being a welsher, and not paying debts on time. He wasn't the most honorable among thieves. This was an interesting characteristic of the book for it isn't one-sided.  It gives you the facts about A.R. whether good or bad.  This book paints a true portrait of the extent of vice which involved politicians, mobsters, athletes, policemen and of course actors and actresses.  There is extensive research with regard to who killed A. R.  I found this part of the book to be very interesting to see all the facts and the "behind the scenes" work unravel.  It reveals the motives: the who, what, when, where, why and how.  The last chapter keeps you very motivated and wanting for more.   There were some great quotes from some old timers and I think one can learn a few things from reading this book.  The book is recommended to other readers.
