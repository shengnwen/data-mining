The problem I find with religion(s) is an Us and Them attitude.  You can't get away from it.  Chopra utilizes a step-by-step procedure allowing us to work our way closer towards God.  There is a no Us and Them attitude.  It's just You, Me and God.  That is where I am able to find God.  Somewhere between You and Me...not between your religious beliefs and mine.  If you start reading this book and become distracted because it's not what you expeted it, bring the book with you everywhere you go and just keep reading and someone may notice the book and join in on a discussion
