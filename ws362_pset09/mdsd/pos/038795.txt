Those who have a closed mind will hate it because it clearly with use of time line graphs clearly show how inefective most of governemt's programs are.  In fact, the only way you can debate the book is just to say "it's nuts" or "don't confuse me with facts" or some other "argument" like that.  It's lucid, well-written and I'd even go as far as calling it revolutionary in its approach to analysing statistical data.  It shows you, for example, how when you look at what happened AFTER a goverment program was put in place has not changed at all the pace of changes which were already taking place.  In other words, the graphs slope hasn't changed.  A super exapmple of logical thinking so much needed in today's society.
