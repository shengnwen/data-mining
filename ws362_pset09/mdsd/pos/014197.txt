I don't remember exactly why I picked this book up, but I enjoyed it a lot. It is humorous and engaging and it becomes progressively odder as it goes. I guess this is a relaxed effort for the author as well as the reader - a light read with plenty of literary references. This book is part satire, part romance, and part horror show. I think I'll pick up Hynes' other novels after I finish typing this review
