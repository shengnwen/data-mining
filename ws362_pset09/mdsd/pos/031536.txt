This book knocked me for six. An extraordinary and powerful piece. Definately not for the faint hearted. I had to keep putting it down to cry my eyes out. It exposes you completely and empowers you in a way that you  can never imagine. I found that i had to keep putting it down several times  before i could finish. I described the &quot;value in the valley&quot; to  one of my friends as a knock out in the ring. I am not just recommending  this to every single female but also male readers. It's helped guide me  through a difficult period. I was able to make a very confusing, difficult  and the most important decision my life look so easy.Iyanla, when would you  be coming to London
