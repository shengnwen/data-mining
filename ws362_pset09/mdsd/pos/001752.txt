Steven Levy, author of Hackers, reprises his examination of the high-tech industry with a close-up on the making of the Macintosh.  Levy retells the story of the Macintosh's genesis, its influence from research at Xerox PARC, the ill-fated Apple Lisa and finally its painful birth.  This is not a classic business book and really doesn't cover the rise and fall of Apple or it's CEOs in any great detail.  Instead this is a more intimate story of the people who helped make the Macintosh.  If you liked &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; you'll love this book
