Because of poor money management by her clergyman father, Agnes becomes a governess, first to the Bloomfield family and then to the Murrays. Writing in the first person, Agnes relates her experiences, taking her remembrances from a journal she's kept for many years. Caring for the three spoiled Bloomfield children, she learns all about arrogance and over-indulgent parenthood. It is always Agnes's fault when the children misbehave. Yet it is her calm reportage and her own high principles that mainly impress the reader. 

With the Murrays her problems are different, and concern mainly the dealings of flirtatious Rosalie, who cares only about finding a suitable husband. Of course she chooses poorly and ends up unhappy. It's Agnes, though, who comes through all this the "victor": not only does she find a good husband in Edward Weston (the curate whom Rosalie had rejected), but she is obviously head-and-shoulders above the upper-middle class people she works for in morality, decency, self-respect, even common sense. To witness Agnes's success is the joy of the book; her straightforward and ironic tone only add to the pleasure
