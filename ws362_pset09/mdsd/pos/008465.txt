Francie begins this story as an eleven-year-old, living in poverty in Brooklyn.  Her father is an alcoholic who takes part-time work as a singing waiter.  Her mother cleans houses to bring in most of their money.  Francie and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, help out by collecting bits of scrap metal and other valuables to sell to the junk man for recycling.  The family lives in a tiny apartment, is looked down on by many others and often they go hungry when money doesn't stretch far enough to buy food.

Despite all of the hardships in her life, though, Francie is nearly overwhelmed by the beauty of the life she is living.  She loves her father's singing voice, and she loves the things her mother is able to cook with their meager supply of food.  She finds peace in listening to her parents talk late at night, and joy in reading every book she can get her hands on.  She is happy in the way only a child can be.

As Francie grows up, she comes to find that life is often hard, and her family is less fortunate than many.  She observes the sacrifices her family members make, and is called upon to make sacrifices of her own.  Throughout it all, though, she never loses her determination or her love for her family and for Brooklyn.

The way Francie thinks and writes is absolutely beautiful.  I like how Smith captured that peculiar habit of children to see the beauty in even the worst of circumstances.  I liked the beginning of this book much better than the end, though.  I was eager to see Francie and her family come into some money and have an easier life, but I felt the end of the book to be a bit too happy to fit with the rest.  When an entire book is about struggling and fending for yourself, it doesn't seem right when something good happens, as it did to Francie's mother, out of the blue
