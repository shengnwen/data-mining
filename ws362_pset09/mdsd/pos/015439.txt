This is a book that that caused emotions to run high when it was first published, and still continues to cause readers to break out into impassioned argument, some of it not very polite.  My own perspective is that Brock got it right on this one, a well researched investigative report on Anita Hill and the left's campaign to discredit a man whose only crime was being black and conservative. Of course those who believed Hill and dislike Thomas will have a totally different viewpoint, which is fine.  My own advice to both groups would be to read both this book and the "Strange Justice" which was the hatchet job commissioned by the vast left wing conspiracy.  Contrary to what some have said, Brock did not disavow this book, rather he said that he went into writing it with the purpose of looking for evidence against Hill and for Thomas.  Of course the author of "Strange Justice" did just the opposite.  Until we actually have an unbiased look at the Thomas hearings (and we may not have that anytime soon) then this book still deserves to be read.  Some other authors to try after this book are Paul Johnson, Ken Hamblin, Shelby Steele, George Will, Dinesh D'Souza and David Horowitz. All of these present a viewpoint that tends to support Brock's conclusions in this, his first book.  However, be warned that you're either going to hate the book or like it.  Unfortunately there appears to be no middle ground in this long lasting debate.  Regardless of your political views this book is a must read, if just to find out what all the hullabaloo was/is about
