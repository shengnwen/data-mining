Good book overall, many pictures of Trimph legends, pictures of most 650 twin-carb models for every year, very detailled specs.  Only drawbacks are black-and-white photos only and no index, but things are easy to find; also, the two-page major part number appendix is a picture of a hand-drawn chart and is difficult to read in spots.  You need this book if you have to tell the difference between the U.S. east coast and west coast 1964 T120C 'TT' models, for instance.  (West coast had 17T gearbox sprocket and a black seat with white piping.)  Or, you need this book if you like Bonnies..
