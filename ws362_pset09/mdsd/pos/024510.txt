Consider this book suited to read :
- on your way to/from work
- before bedtime 
- in your free time

 Matter of fact: It doesn't matter when you want to read it, you will just be pushed by some imaginary force, to finish reading it.

The examples and explications you will find in this book, mixed with the author's storytelling talent, will guide you with a smile on your face to what Advertising means and how it SHOULD be. 

The book can be a manual, a brochure upon creativity, a testimony, whatever you want it to be. Bottom line: It's useful.

Teaches and amuses. You don't even have to be in the advertising area, you will feel at ease and not patronized.

If you expect a cocky attitude from mr. Sullivan, in order to just belittle you and shove down your throat the "HOW WONDERFUL I AM , and HOW I MADE IT!" ideas ...then it is not the original book that you are holding.

Happy reading and ...enjoy!
