He will dig through his basket of, say, 20 books just to find this one.  He is too young to read and has trouble even waiting for me to page through it with him, but if I leave him alone this is the book he picks.  I suppose it is the primary colors and the simple shapes.  I suspect I will have to pick up some more of Barton's books to see if they work too..
