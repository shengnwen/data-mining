I'm fed up with hearing people complain about these books.  I've read the first eight and they have all been amazing.  Many people like to complain about how detailed Jordan gets with his writing.  In contrast, thousands upon thousands of other fans of this series don't seem to mind.  

When i read the Wheel of Time books i feel like i am part of the story, like i am experiencing things first-hand.  If you love to read and you love to read fantasy, the Wheel of Time series is amazing and there are now 11 books and a prequel for you to get to.

If you don't like this series because it is long and because Jordan is descriptive than stop reading it.  I for one enjoy every page and appreciate it as much, if not more than Harry Potter.

Jordan's characters come alive when you pick up these books and i still get excited when i see that the next chapter follows one of my favorite characters.  Some people may complain about pages that are wasted explaining things and detailing clothing and etc., however, Jordan makes reading his books a fulfilling experience and i wouldn't have them any shorter than they are.

In conclusion:
1. Yes this series is very long.
2. Yes Robert Jordan is a descriptive writer.
3. THESE BOOKS ARE WORTH EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR TIME.
   (If you lose interest, stop reading them it's not the end of
    the world.  But don't tell people not to read books that
    you have thoroughly enjoyed.)

Thank you,

p.s.  I remember sitting in the movie theatre after seeing the Fellowship of the Ring.  A woman behind me started complaining loudly.  "WHAT THAT'S IT?  IT'S NOT OVER?"  I think i speak for most people when i say that those movies were pretty good and worth the time it took to watch them.  The same goes for the Wheel of Time books, they are long and tedious, but they are some of the greatest stories i have ever read.
