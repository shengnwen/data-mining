The smells are as powerful as the emotions in this book written by a daughter of Presbyterian ministers and America's first female Nobel Laureate.One can almost get the smell of warm blood in the nostrils of Wang Lung , the main character, as he ruminates on the ill omen of the birth of his first daughter and third child or the 'slave' as girl children were known. Bestseller in 1931/32 it gives a glimpe of China on the verge of change.
Buck's characters pulsate with life as they tell a Chinese, yet a universal tale of man's ever increasing estrangement from the land.
The fortunes of peasant farmer Wang Lung ebb and flow alongside those of the inhabitants of the Great House of Hwang in the rural Anwhei province and later in the rich rural South.
Human emotions leap out from the page as Wang Lung oscillates between destitution and self indulgence, while Olan , his wife remains servile in extremis.
It offers a compelling close up of Chinese mores and culture through the broad lens of a western born, oriental raised author
