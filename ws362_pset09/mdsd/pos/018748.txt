In this book, Albert Camus speaks to us with much understanding and clarity about the unconscious cause and the rational basis of suicide, and the aspects of belief and atheism. I would say that how he justifies, or by which manner he justifies his atheism, is somewhat clearer or more "decent" (forgive the expression) than that of Nietzsche, Sartre or even Freud.   

Here he lists down the different responses on the absurdity of existence, citing that of Kierkegaard and Kafka, among others, and thereafter he inserts his obvervations on their "leaping" acquiesence. In the appendix of the book, Camus blasted the "existentials" with eloquence: "They embrace the God that consumes them." After you read the book, and despite of its many cryptic epigrams, you will carry inside you the clarity of the author's honest reasoning.

And the accompanying essays? "Summer in Algiers" is one of the most beautiful writings by any man that I have ever read. Here is the voice of an indifferent, stammering god. "A hopelessly poignant thing," Nabokov would say.

The other essays in this collection are in same manner, lyrical, and are an essential part of the book as a whole.
