First of all, thanks to all who have taken the time to read my book, and to those who have taken the time to write a review.  When I wrote the book it was my intention to inform potential sitters of the pros and cons of pet sitting - many people think that it is, well, 'a walk in the park'.  Well, many times it is - and sometimes it isn't.  It was definitely not my intention to stop anyone's dream from becoming a reality...but I do believe it is better to know if something is right for you or not before your whole HEART is put into it.  I am glad to read the words &quot;humor&quot;, &quot;wit&quot;, &quot;laughter&quot;, &quot;amusing&quot; and &quot;smile&quot; in the reviews.  I wrote the book in a candid way for SITTERS as well as ALL PET OWNERS....even though our furry &amp; feathery friends lift our spirits each and every day, putting more LAUGHTER in our lives doesn't hurt.  After reading the 'reality' of pet sitting, should you decide to continue your pursuit of pet sitting - or decide to perhaps choose working with animals in a different profession - I am glad I could help steer you in the right direction, and wish you all the best!  To all pet lovers who purchase my book in the future, thank you in advance
