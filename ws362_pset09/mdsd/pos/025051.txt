This book is definitely worth a read, since it gives parents options to consider when faced with the typical challenges of parenting.  The basic premise is that good parents teach children to use their minds in order to make decisions, and that by allowing them to do just that with everyday, small issues, they'll be prepared to handle the big decisions later on.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to consciously parent their children
