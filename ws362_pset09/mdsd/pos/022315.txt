This is simply the best book I've read regarding atheism in the past twenty years.  As a former evangelist and seminary graduate, I found this book to be a simple, yet profound, clarification and summarization of the issues that need to be honestly addressed by all believers and truth-seekers today.  We've now had the benefit of centuries of scientific data, and it's time that we deal with those data forthrightly and avoid the mistakes of our forefathers.  For them it may have been more permissible to misunderstand the science, but for us today it can only be a brazen and embarrassingly oafish recalcitrance that would cause us to ignore the facts at hand.  David exposes the truth and addresses the data in a manner in which there can be no misunderstanding, or refutation, of what to the honest truth-seeker has to be obvious, and no longer controversial.  The facts are in, and David pulls all the salient data together in a brilliantly written exposition.  There are other books that are more technical, but none that are more lucid, succinct, contemporary, and saturated with the intellectual response that we must provide to the facts
