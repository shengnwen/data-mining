Dialogue.  One word yet so many connotations.  In our complex world of technology, toys, processes, downsizings, mergers, etc. there is one key element that continues to cause and raise exponentially increasing problems.  That problem is communication.  Or, lack thereof.  I think that many of us forgot the art and the science of dialogue.  Talking.  Listening.  One-on-one.

I think that we're given so many tools to work wherever and whenever; it's the likeness to using a keyboard or a calculator instead of writing with a pen and doing the actual computations.  In the myriad and flurry of systemic, organizational maneuvers we forgot how to talk to each other and with each other.  For some people, they've never learned the beauty and mystery of dialogue.

Dialogue, to me, is the ability to acutely listen to a story, enjoy it, have non-verbal reactions, and take it in while challenging the message with my own filters.  We all have filters that are individual to us and therefore send us what messages we want to hear and shut out the ones we don't want.  If we can flip off our filters for a moment and just pretend that we've met that neat person on the street, someone new in the grocery market, or an intriguing individual at a party and dialogue (share information and exchanges back and forth) then life becomes an enriching experience.  And, it is a guarantee that from that individual you will always learn something new.

Meg Wheatley's book reminds me of "going back to the basics."  Just talk to people.  Listen with open ears and concentration with what they have to say.  A lot of our world problems would be solved with better communication that lacks threat if we dialogued and if parties were willing to dialogue.
