great book, i've read all ten they never get old. (can't wait till her next one comes out!) This is a really great book for anyone who believes in rebirth. katharine kerr portrays it wonderfully as well as giving magic a more realistic look. Over all a great adventure and a very touching story of love. She really gives the term "sole mates" a new spin
