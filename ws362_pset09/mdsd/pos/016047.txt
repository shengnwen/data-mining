Njal's saga is a story of relationships. Imagine Iceland about 1000 A.D. Winter is long. Your relationships with other people, friends, enemies, wives, in-laws, sons and daughters, foster sons and daughters govern your and everyone else's lives. Like the Greek trgedies, the fates that seek out the saga's inhabitants are announced beforehand. Njal knows that he, his wife and sons will die as a result of a specific action. The Icelanders invariably continue to remember past insults, kill neighbors, or be killed despite clear premonition. The saga, also like other good drama, builds in small but clear steps. Gunnar Hamundarson, the predecessor in death of Njal and a strong warrior, is besieged in his house and facing death. He has driven off most of his attackers, though,with bow and arrow until an enemy slices through his bow string. He turns to his wife and asks her to cut her hair to make him a new bow string. "Does anything depend on it, asked Hallgerd [his wife]. my life depends on it," replied Gunnar....In that case, said Hallgerd, I shall now remind you of the slap you once gave me..."

Also included is a sometime fascinating, sometimes overlong, description of Icelandic legal processes, which clearly greatly influenced or were similar to English (by way of the Normans) and so to us...

Great book.
