Dr Faustus was the most difficult read ive ever had but it was extrememly enjoyable.If youd like a real intellectual challenge then Dr Faustus provides such.Presented on many levels with a multi-layered plot focusing  on musical genius Adrian Leverkuhn who enters into a diabolical pact to  further his musical talents,his insight his genius this story is really the  analagous tale of post war Germany and how the nation reshaped itself,its  own perception and the worlds and how it deals with the horrendous moments  of its history.Told by Adrians best friend,the story has many complex  musical descriptions and uses this musical imagery to set a tone,to define  a mood that pervades the book.To try to relate it to something understood  the atmosphere of the book reminded me a little of the movie 'Amadeus'-but  of course with so much more depth and scope.The book may seem abstruse at  times but it is a beautiful work of fiction,a true masterpiece which any  serious adult reader looking for real depth would appreciate
