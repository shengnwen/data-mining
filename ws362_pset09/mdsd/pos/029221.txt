Model rocketry has come a long way since this book's first edition was published and the book does a great job of covering the basics of "How to get started" while addressing the ever expanding set of topics being introduced 40+ years later.  The book provides some of the hobby's history and the 'hows and whys' of model rocketry.  The book balances detail such as mathematics to compute aeronautical computations with rules of thumb one can use if science and math are not as interesting as building and safely launching a cool model rocket.  While the book does not comprehensively cover mid and high power model rocketry topics, it does address some of the basics for those 'moving up'.  Photos and illustrations are great.
