This is not a typical romance novel.  It has romance but it is more about political intrigue, murder and suspense.  Although there is revenge, justice and a happy ending, there were too many loved ones who died which makes it too sad for me.  Aside from that, it is well written with intriguing characters.  There is heroism and great love.  Sexual content: mild
