As a remedial reading teacher, I am always looking for good literature to teach language arts skills such as parts of speech, story elements, as well as phonics.  This book makes it simple to find a quality piece of  literature to use as a springboard for other skill activities.  I highly  recommend it to ANY teacher who wants to teach students skills through  literature!
