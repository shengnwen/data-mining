I remember first seeing the movie. It was AFTER reading the first Clerks comic. I have to be honest, the comics are much better than the movie. That's my opinion. But if your going to spend $18 on the video, insted,  spend HALF that on this book. You WILL laugh. The stories follow Randal's  obsesion with the booming action figure market, Dante trying to win a  fifteen year old bet and Randal trying to stop him. Plus, the infamus  'funeral' scene that was cut from the movie due to budget problems. See one  of Santa's elves rent a porno from Randal. See Dante running for his life  after getting kicked out of a mentel hospitle for 'caning' a patient. You  gotta see it. Lets review: Movie = hilarious   Comics = better. Snoogans
