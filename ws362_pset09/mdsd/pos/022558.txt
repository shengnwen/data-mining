Are you feeling hungry today? Bullfrog Pops by Rick Walton is a weird, but cool story. The frog named Bullfrog is like Pac-man, always shutting and opening his mouth. Bullfrog mostly never stops eating in this book.  I really think young kids should check it out, especially 3rd graders.    
                                                                                                                                                                                             
The pictures may not be the best, but the background and setting are the best part of the book.  Bullfrog Pops has lots of great colors and does not have many words, so this book is good for young kids that love pictures. The way the letters are printed was unique and also the favorite saying in the book, "But, I'm still hungry!"

 	The book's setting takes place in either Texas or Mexico.  Kids who love staring at tasty treats like pizza, and at all junk food, especially quesadillas --- you'll love this book. I also love the way the book tells you not to eat too much and not to be greedy about something.  I think it's a great book for youngsters.

In the middle of the story the town's people try to arrest Bullfrog.  I have to say it would be a terrific book to see, look, and checkout at a library near you.  The setting matches the book because the food all looks like there from Mexico or Texas.  It would be better if they came up with a Bullfrog two.

I recommend this book for all ages-rated E. The book is full of laughter and has good pictures and is cool.  If you ever go to a library, check out Bullfrog Pops for sure and make me proud. Oh and make sure you read it, ok!
