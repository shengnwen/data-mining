If you've ever wondered what kinds of formulas physicists deal with to solve complex ideas such as String Theory, look no further than this book.

I have looked everywhere for the real equations that physicists use, but to no avail. Finally, I purchased this little gem and it fulfills all of my hopes. 

Not only does this book give you the actual run-down of what the equation at hand looks like, the author, Sander Bais, breaks the formula down to describe it piece by piece. Bais breaks down what each variable represents and what your end result would be if you were to actually do the problem. Bais includes graphs to represent what the end result should look like, as well as the ranges the equation's answers should fall into when solved. Great book.

My only quarrel is that this book has a fault. One of the equations is wrong (as you've read through other reviews). And since this book is called "The Equations", I think it's a major mistake. That's why I give it a 4. Otherwise, this is a superbly insightful book. Anyone with any interest in physics of mathematics should definately take a look at this book
