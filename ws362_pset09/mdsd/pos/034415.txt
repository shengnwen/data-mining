The book is a compilation of lecture essays that were delivered in Scotland (I think). He takes contemporary issues in war and peace and holds them up to the just war tradition and carves a path between liberal and conservative assumptions on issues such as nuclear warfare, urban guerilla warfare, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and their relation to a Christian political theology.

Although I am extremely uncomfortable with the ease with which O'Donovan speaks about justifiable wars; I was impressed with his articulation of discrimination in warfare. I am quite happy that the just war conversation has such well-articulate 'fans'; yet his connection of this tradition to the Christian Church and faith is disturbing.

His most problematic theological assumption is that the current 'dispensation' (a term he doesn't use, but assumes) is such that warfare is a proper expression of the judgment of the state. In his brief mention of eschatology, he suggests that since the kingdom of God is off in some distant future; the state and its warfare are necessary, and God gifted, provisional instruments used in God's justice-purposes. In other words, Christ's focal message of 'God's kingdom come' is completely left aside in favor of a quasi-realist, quasi-pragmatic practice of violent judgment.

I just wanted to ask O'Donovan if all this nitpicking about just causes, just weapons, and appropriate discrimination of attacks would have made any difference to Jesus who could be found, in all likelihood, among the ashes and the dying of any given war. Is any war 'just' that leaves children ripped to shreds? Challenging, good, and frustrating read...
