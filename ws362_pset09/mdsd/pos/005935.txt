I have read all of Ms. Gardner's books, they are always good but not like this one.  WOW, I just can't think of a suitable word to describe how much I loved this book.  It got you hooked right from the beginnng and didn't let go until you read the last page.  Fast-paced, intriguing, full of many mysteries and great characters, I was up until 2am reading this, just couldn't put it down.
