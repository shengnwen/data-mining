I am not a book reviewer. I am a book reader. What I love about this book is its look at a different way of being. This one happens to center on economics. Fine by me. "Mr. Heinlein please tell me a story centered around economics" and he did. I use this book as a way to broaden peoples perception about the world around us. The fact that things don't have to stay the way they are and won't even if we want them to. I also found it very interesting that right after I finished this book there was a news post about some guy who was selling his services to people who had mortgages and telling them that they didn't owe anything to the bank because it was illegal for the bank to issue a mortgage  This book makes me want to go out and learn more about our economic system. I think if nothing else comes of this that that is enough
