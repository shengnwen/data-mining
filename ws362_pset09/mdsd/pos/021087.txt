I got this book unabridged on CD.  I would often listen to it while doing chores around the house or other mundane projects. My wife and I usually have our own books that we'll read together, but it was interesting how the story kind of pulled her in too, even though she wasn't listening to it to begin with. Upon discovering I had listened to some without her, my wife was like, "what? You listened to it without me?!" My response was, "I didn't even think you were listening to it." That's how hooked you can get on this story.

The Lincoln Lawyer follows the story of Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney whose personal life is teetering.  He finally gets a break at work when the perfect case falls into lap.  The client is called "the franchise" due to the fact that he's a high-roller who pays well, and more importantly on-time.  As the case continues, Mickey starts to detect red flags as his client doesn't seem all that trustworthy.  It reaches a crescendo when a good friend of his murdered while working on the case.

This book isn't good because of plot. In fact I found the plot to be pretty cut-and-dry: Man gets mysterious client, client turns out crooked, story turns into a big whodunit, blah, blah, blah. This book is good because of the writing. It's both intelligent and believable.  You really start to gravitate towards the characters because each has their own distinct personality. If there's any problem I have with the writing, it would have to the liberal use of the F-word. Do people actually use it that much in law? It made things feel more like a construction site. It may be there for shock value, but you'll get numb to it before you're even a third of the way through. All in all, an interesting read that will keep you up late saying, "just one more chapter."
