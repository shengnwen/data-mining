The title of the book is a little bit misleading; I was under the impression, when I bought the book, that it is going to tackle the history of the wife from a world historical perspective or at least from an overall western perspective. However, the book focuses mainly on the US and Britain and it touches a little bit on the Roman and Greek civilizations. Even the Church does not get as much coverage as it should have had since the Church played a big role in defining marriage the way we know it today in the Christian world.
Having said all that, I still enjoyed reading this book for the amount of historical events that it contains from Europe and the US. It is easy to read and follow and Marilyn Yalom focuses more on showing what women thought and experienced throughout history in their own words than on her own thoughts and hypothesis, which is good because she allows the reader to participate in the analysis of the events.

A good book and I recommend it if you are interested in learning about the evolution of the woman's place in society in Europe and the US. 

(Some people might find all the text about history a little hard to read (in other words a bit boring) but if you're a history lover then you'll enjoy it and if you are interested in the woman's movement then this is the book for you
