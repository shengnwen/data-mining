I GOT THIS BOOK FOR MY SON, FROM THE LIBRARY, AND HE LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT HE WANTED TO 'HIGHLITE' SO MANY THINGS.  I ORDERED IT FOR HIM AS HE IS INTERESTED IN BUILDING A LOG HOUSE, BUT THEN HE FOUND A 6 YR. OLD LOG HOUSE, BUT THIS BOOK HAD ADVISED HIM AS TO THE BEST TYPE OF TIMBERS, AND MANY OTHER THINGS. HE WAS ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE OWNER THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WITHOUT THE WONDERFUL INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK
