Anthony Hope continues his gripping saga of the Prisoner of Zenda in this adventureous sequel. Rupert of Hentzau is well written and keeps the reader in constant suspense. Hope follows his traditional writing style of  unexpected twists in the end. The book builds the reader up full of emotion  and then concludes by purging the reader of all emotions. Rupert of Hentzau  is full of deuls, escapes, conspiracies, and love. At the start one might  be inclined to pause and stop reading, but as the book continues this is no  longer an option. This is truly a worthy sequel and only makes you respect  Rudolf Rassendel more for his quick wit, ability to overcome obstacles and  continous love for Queen Flavia. Our hero ends the book the same manner  that he finished Prisoner of Zenda, as a gentleman worthy to be a king
