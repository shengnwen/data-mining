This, the first of the Jacqueline Kirby books, does a wonderful job introducing Ms. Kirby.  Just as grown children leave home to start a new phase in their life, so does their middle-aged parents.  Jacqueline does a fine job disregarding the past to open up a new and exciting phase in her life which includes helping a group of young graduate students solve a murder.  Her intelligence and past experience leaves her prepared for every eventuality!  A delightful romp
