"Now" was a treasure possibly taken for granted for the years it was on PBS.  I discovered it way too late and now Bill Moyers is gone and the show is only 1/2 hour.  David B. is doing a good job, but apparently even had to find a new sponsor.  Hopefully he can hold down the fort for a long time.

But at least Bill Moyer's words are available in this book.  As was evident in the discussions on "Now", Moyers is not afraid to let his humaness shine through with all the struggles to follow the path of an ethical life.  I loved the chapter on Lyndon Johnson, the goal to give everyone a hand up is a shining light compared to the everyone for himself tenor of today.  Moyers lays out the success and failures of the Johnson years, but I came away feeling good that a president got into office and started out wanting to do what would be good for all the people in the country:to make a fresh start and say what are the highest goals we can reach for.

The last section of the book is on aging.  Wise words here too.  I hope as he ages Bill Moyers keeps writing and producing programs filled with his common sense and wisdom.

Thank you Mr. Moyers for all your work and keep on keeping on
