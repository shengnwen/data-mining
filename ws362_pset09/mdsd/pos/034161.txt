The writer Anne Patchett was the poet Lucy Grealy's best friend. After Grealy died, Patchet wrote "Truth and Beauty" as a testiment to their friendship and to Grealy's life-long struggle with her deformity from facial cancer. "Truth and Beauty" is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two amazing writers, and an expose of the meaning of true friendship. It is especially interesting to read together with Lucy Grealy's book "The Autobiography of a Face." Everyone that I have lent my copies of the book to has agreed that they are the read of a lifetime
