Conventional wisdom can, at times, be wrong.  This may very well be true of the idea that simply building more prisons and throwing more people in jail will solve the problem of crime.  Very simply, Currie points out that this only takes care of the criminals who are caught.  It really does nothing to take care of the problem at its source.

Although prison has a deterrent effect, the effect is relative to the situation the person finds himself in.  For instance, if the person is desperate, the person is more likely to commit a crime than a person who is well off.  Prison, as pointed out in the book, is largely mere incarceration.  It protects the public, but it doesn't solve the problem.

What struck me most about this book is the number or programs that have worked at reducing crime.  I was happy to see that change is possible, but I was dismayed that none of this seems to be making much of a foothold in political arenas.  People are still in the grip of fear.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to seriously think about the problem of crime.  I would also (if I had the power) require this book of all politicians whose office directly affects the citizenry
