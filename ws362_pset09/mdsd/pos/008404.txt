I was recommeded this book by a fitness coach.  I was about 50 lbs overweight and suffering health problems.  Anyhow, I been following the program for about 2 months now and occasionally work out and have lost 25 lbs.  I tried Atkins before and did lose about 40 lbs, but as soon as I went off and added carbs back I gained weight like no tomorow.  I wore everything I ate.  With this program I eat a lot of fruit and vegtables and the part that is great is it seems to kill your hunger after awhile.  I used to think about food most of the time and with this program, I actually sometimes have to remind myself to eat.  That is completely un-heard of for me prior.  Additionally, I feel much better, my compexion, and skin is much healthier looking.  I ve lost about 25 lbs already and I have  energy to want to work out.  With Atkins I had no energy and no endurance.  Occasionaly when I cheat, and eat bread, it actually upsets my stomach now.   I used to have indigestion frequently, now that is also gone.  I highly recommend this program
