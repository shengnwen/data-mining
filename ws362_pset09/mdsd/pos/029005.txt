When I was browsing through Amazon to check on some books for possible reading material, I came across one reader who have a list of books that she had read and rated and this book was one of them. I checked it out, read the synopsis and was kind of hesitant to buy this for myself since I am not really a big fan of fictional stories about vampires and love. My genre in the books that I like to read are historical romances and love timetravel (you know, present day woman stumbling into a rock somewhere in Scotland and catapulting into the past and finding love, that kind of thing). But since Dark Lover have a lot of good reviews from the readers, I decided to try and read it and BINGO! it got me hooked. I did not just purchased the Dark Lover but all of the Black Dagger Brotherhood books, Lover Eternal, Lover Awakened and Lover Revealed. I am now reading Lover Eternal and that is a good one too, but that is for another review and comments. So if you have not read these books yet, please, don't hesitate to purchase and have them in your collection, they are really worth it
