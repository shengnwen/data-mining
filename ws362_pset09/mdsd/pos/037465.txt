I came to this novel after reading "The city of Ember", also an excellent young adult novel, although with an entirely different style of writing.  "Ember" has a very simple, transparent style and "Fly" is astoundingly literate and deft.  After a brief struggle to shift gears I dove in deep and loved every moment of it.  The pet goose idea, which I was prepared to dislike, never grated; the goose is always believable as a goose (though perhaps an exceptionally fierce one), and Mosca is always believable as a young girl, albeit a very canny and adventurous one.
The characters are all wonderfully portrayed, the writing delights, and I would give it more stars if I could
