                I like this book because of the surprises in it like when Tibby learns that Bailey has leukemia and is sick in the hospital. Another is when Carmen gets so mad her dad and his new family that she throws a rock through their dining room window. 
             The book is about 4 girls Bridget, Carmen, Lena, and Tibby that go on adventures. Lena, the quite one, goes to a Greek island. Bridget , the adventurous one, goes to Baja, California. Carmen, the exciting one, goes to North Carolina. Tibby , the lazy one, stays in Washington D.C. They each set out on their own adventures promising to tell each other everything when they unite.	
	  I would recommend this book to someone that enjoys  reading a book about a strong bond between friends and one very special pair of pants. This book also has a lot of surprises in it like when Lena and a Greek boy named Kostos fall in love at the end but Lena ignores him for most of the summer. This book was great and I can't wait to read the second book
