I loved this story line. Nora makes it so easy to picture every tiny detail. The big Italian family, the restaurant they own, and the small town. I couldn't put this book down. Usually I have a problem with stories that keep jumping into the future, but I had absolutely no problem with this book whatsoever. Actually, being able to watch the characters develop and grow over that time period was one of the things I liked most about the book. By the end of the story I felt like I knew all the characters.
