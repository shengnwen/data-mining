Karl Dahl allegedly committed three brutal murders at the Haas home and is about to go on trial for them. When Judge Carey Moore rules for the defense that his prior bad acts are inadmissible, all hell breaks loose for lots of people. She's beaten in the parking ramp after work the day of her ruling, the convict escapes, a police detective looses it and goes over the edge, the Judge is kidnapped, people turn up dead. The list of suspects for the beating and kidnapping is long. Minneapolis police detectives Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska learn more than they care to know about the Judge's family and the Haas family as they try to close this high-profile case.

There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested. Lots of characters, but no confusion about who's who. I hope the author can keep up the good work and give us more stories like this or even better. But keep do keep Kovac in line; I know this is fiction, but he was a tad unbelievable in this one
