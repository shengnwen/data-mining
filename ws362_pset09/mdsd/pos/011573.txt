Not a title to keep you awake at night, but it still beats television.  While the complete evolutionary flow chart will be forever up to argument, it is a difficult concept to sanely disparage.  The beginning of life, to me at least, is a far more loaded issue.  Ruse's writing style, while not obtuse, reminds me of the theolgical texts, which seemed to run constantly in circles, that I was once forced to read.  But, the author puts forward a serious defense of the subject that can be understood by the folks who were not biology majors.  A good selection for public and academic libraries and a good read for the interested layman
