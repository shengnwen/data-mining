This is one of the best books I've read in a long time - I couldn't put it down.  It was so enthralling that immediately after I finished it, I had to read it again.  It's like experiencing "Silence of the Lambs" by olfactory senses.  Mr. Suskind has woven a fantastic web of a story here, keeping you captured with each page, and tops it off with a totally mind-bending, ghastly ending.  I highly recommend this book.  It was thoroughly and fiendishly enjoyable.  I can only hope once I'm able to view the movie, they do it justice.  But I promise you - once, you read "Perfume," you'll wonder how on earth a movie could be made with this story line
