WHITE LIES is an earlier novel by Linda Howard and for those of us who are avid fans, it shows.  About half way through the book, I looked at the publication date (1988) and realized why it lacked the zing present in her recent books.

WHITE LIES opens with Jay Granger being fired and later that night a visit from the FBI is paid to her.  What could she have done to warrant this visit?  Well, seems her ex-husband was in an explosion and they want her to identify him.  He's alive, but in a drug induced coma.  She goes to the hospital only to see a man resembling a mummy.  How could she identify him since the features she could see were either swollen or bruised, or had been put back together by plastic surgeons?  But FBI agent Frank Payne pushed for a positive identification and she said it was Steve Crossfield, her ex-husband.

When Crossfield responds to her touching his arm, Payne persuades her to stay with him until he's completely recovered, which could be a few months.  With her there, Crossfield struggles to regain consciousness only to realize he has amnesia.  So it's a bit convoluted and far-fetched, but remember he was in a massive explosion and wasn't supposed to live.  Ok, so it's pure fiction, but it's enjoyable!

WHITE LIES is not one of Howard's best pieces of fiction, but true to form (even in the early stages) it's fun to read and at times you will chuckle out loud.  There are way too many coincidences in the book to be of the mystery genre, so I guess it could be labeled strictly pleasurable romance.
