Got this book out of the library, and my young daughter was mesmerized by the extraordinary illustrations, as well as being fascinated by the good doctor, and his ability to speak to his various and highly characterized animal friends.

While it's not the original, I wouldn't have been able to read her the original (not on shelves around the libraries where I live).  So, this was a really great way to introduce her.

Since she liked this one so much, she's checked out at least 7 other Dolittle books, so I'm quite grateful to Books of Wonder that they re-did this one and the Story of Dr. Dolittle with the Michael Hague illustrations; they opened a whole world to my daughter, and she can read through a couple of pages at a time herself now that she's 8.  Also, we read aloud as the bedtime story, and there's plenty to talk about as far as different time, era, animal behavior, friendship etc.  I'd never seen any Hague illustrations before and I was bowled over by them myself.  I'm ordering off Amazon as a gift book

As far as the editing/censorship, there's still plenty to talk about in adventures taking place in a different time and place
