A year after Roosevelt lost a third-party bid for the White House in 1912, he decided it was time to take on an adventure of a different color. So, he tossed together a group of people, including his son Kermit, and headed down to South America for a journey down an unexplored tributary of the Amazon known as the "River of Doubt." Leading the group along with Roosevelt is Brazil's most celebrated explorer, Candido Mariano de Silva Rondon. Rondon had made several attempts down the River of Doubt, most resulting in the deaths or near-deaths of dozens of his team members in a variety of terrible ways. For not only is the river packed with rapids and piranhas, but the Amazon itself is a killer rainforest full of hundreds of horrific ways to die. It's got everything from bugs to animals to snakes to bacteria to extremely angry natives with poison-tipped arrows. In fact, it's almost like the rainforest itself comes alive as a single predatory unit. And unprepared, unknowing explorers like Roosevelt and his team soon find themselves its prey. 

This book is packed with fascinating information about the Amazon and its animals and people. But what's more, it tells an absolutely gripping tale of adventure the likes of which I haven't encountered in a very long time. Once I got into this book, I found it nearly impossible to put down -- I couldn't believe what Roosevelt and his team were going through, or that they kept on going even after the Amazon nearly took them out dozens of times over! It's brilliantly written, extremely well-researched, and just damn entertaining. Highly, HIGHLY recommended (and man, somebody needs to turn this into a movie ASAP!).
