I LOVED this book!  I read it in a single day.  I have read everything else of Maupin's and strongly recommend this novel, too.  This is probably my favorite book of his.

The author had more lyrical descriptions in this book than I remember from his past volumes.  I found myself rereading lines and paragraphs simply for the sheer beauty of language.  The falling apart relationship between Gabriel and Jess also hit me as realistic and at times almost too painful to read.

A great book!!!
