I have wanted an unabridged version of This Present Darkness on cassette for years and I finally got one.  However, I tried to listen to it on vacation and I found I could only listen for maybe an hour at a time and then I would have to take a break to keep from getting sleepy.  For a long drive the radio dramas for The Left Behind Series or any of the Focus On the Family Radio dramas would have served the higher purpose of keeping me from highway hypnosis.  For shorter trips these tapes would have been fine and after the narrator settles in, he did some great voices.  Peretti threw in some great lines that made me laugh both when I have read the book and when I listened to the tapes.
