I really enjoyed this novel. This is the first book I've read by Dekker and I found him to be an excellent read. It delievers a good blend of action, revenge, romance, and religion. I also liked the fact that the story was told from most of the character's point of view. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I'm not really religous and that whole "love of God" thing held no meaning for me. Altogether a great story with some issues about terrorism that hit close to home
