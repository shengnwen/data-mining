Those not familiar with Doctorow's style may have an initial problem with this book.  Doctorow is infamous for paragraph-long sentences and multitudes of characters (both factual and fictional).  Once the appreciation is realized that the author's style is more impressionist than photographic, The March becomes a moving picture in words and provides the reader a sensual experience, bringing the reader into the story as a participant in events, rather than an observer.

Having read and enjoyed some of his other works, Ragtime (The March's Coalhouse Walker's son featured as a key character), Billy Bathgate, Loon Lake and World's Fair, The March is far less `difficult' a read.  Doctorow remains true to using words as Renoir brush-strokes, myriad touches of color that together make an amazing picture, but moves the story more quickly.  The March is the blur of experience one might have had being part (or a victim) of Sherman's march to the sea.

This is a great read for Doctorow or Civil War fans
