I love the detail and thought that went into all the pictures.  The story rhymes very well.  As for the name "nut brain" is really referring to some dinosaurs having brains that were the size of walnuts.  I noticed a lot of soda bottles (no brands), was just trying to picture the dinosaurs as the children they see out and about.  What your child eats and drinks really is a model of what you eat/drink or that you are a sucker and make like different meals for everybody at your table or tv for that matter, haha.  The only soda in my home is Henry Weinhardts root beer and its been there for a long, long time.  Every adult who has seen this book I've given to my 6 month old daughter says this ones going to delight her for a long, long time
