Others have given plot summaries so I'll cut to the chase. Yes, parts are convoluted and perhaps a bit hard to believe, but somehow Karin Slaughter can write books that are spell-binding page-turners with characters who are riveting enough (although not necessarily likeable) to make it difficult to put the book down and to wait for the next installment in the series. I like the fact that in this particular book, the female characters seem to be moving in some better directions (or at least, in some directions) towards the end.

I would highly recommend reading all the books in this series in order. With some series you can read the books out of order without much effect, but I think in order to really capture the characters' personalities and various complexities, this series needs to be read in order
