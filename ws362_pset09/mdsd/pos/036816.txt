It's incredible to me that some folks think Dave's brother is fudging a story for his own profit! Okay, granted, he didn't suffer as much as Dave, but he still suffered horrendous abuse from this vile, disturbed woman who was his mother. Tell me, why shouldn't he be allowed to tell his own personal story? From what I have read, all those boys suffered horribly, and if they tell their stories just for the sake of enlightening people that this kind of thing does in fact exist in our nation, then that's a very brave and commendable undertaking IMHO.
