The dumbing down of American kids is staunchly opposed by the BrainQuest series that stimulates kids in the back seat of the car or the airplane or anywhere they'd be otherwise bored to oblivion. The 1500 questions and  answers (kind of like Trivial Pursuit crossed with a deck of cards) are  easy to read, cross and wide range of subjects and challenge and stimulate  readers of all ages (even grownups will love them.) Best of all, the  inherent assumption is that your brain never tires of challenge! Too often  on a trip, kids lapse into the &quot;covered wagon syndrome&quot; where  they kind of stare blankly off into space, waiting for the trip to end.  Brainquest cards (they come in a gazillion levels and varieties for all  ages) really keep kids' brains attached to their bodies. My only criticism  is that often the questions are too hard for kids to read and they hold it  up for me to read in the rear view mirror (I drive a lot) and if it were in  mirror writing, I could read it. Oh well. Small criticism I suppose. It's a  great series. Keep a couple stashed under the car seat or in the glove  compartment. The only thing even remotely as good as Brainquest is  GeoSafari (which costs ten times as much and is the size of a laptop  computer). Take time to try some of the Brainquest cards at home, then  enjoy them in the car or on the plane. They also make great presents for  teachers
