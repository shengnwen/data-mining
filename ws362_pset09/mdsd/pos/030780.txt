Excellent, comprehensive guide. You will keep it right next to your Barcalounger for easy reference; believe me, you will find yourself reading it just for the sake of reading it! Great source for learning about good movies you've never heard of.  I give it five stars particularly for:

* excellent indices (title, star, director)
* comprehensive - they're all in there!
* consistent, fair review
