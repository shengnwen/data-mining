The use of this book is the reason why I was able to score a 13 on the MCAT verbal reasoning section. I had never been that satisfied at my performance on standardized test verbal sections, but I also wanted to score well on the MCAT verbal. Over this past summer before the August 2005 MCAT, I used this book as my main verbal practices. When compared to every other resource out there other than the official old MCATs from the AAMC, this guide has the most MCAT-like passages and questions. In fact, they are slightly more difficult than the actual test. With 11 practice verbal tests, this provided enough practice to figure out what I needed to do to correctly answer the most difficult verbal questions
