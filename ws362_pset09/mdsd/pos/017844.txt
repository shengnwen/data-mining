Extremely insightful, witty, relevant, and pleasurable to read with the one major caveat that all the white women in the novel are one dimensional walking stereotypes who basically show up to seduce Muslim men and then crawl away with no real exploration of their motives or thought processes by the author, unlike the ones afforded to all the novel's other characters. Keeping this criticism in mind, read the book and enjoy it. Just try and find a white female character in the novel whose behavior doesn't follow this trajectory
