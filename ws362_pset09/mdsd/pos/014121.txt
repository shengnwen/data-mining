Drug War Heresies may be the best book ever written about modern U.S. drug policy.  Written by a psychologist and an economist, the authors draw on attempts to control other substances (such as alcohol prohibition in the U.S.) and exhaustively examine the alternative and experimental European drug policies that most American readers will find particularly useful.  The authors are careful to not impose their values and beliefs into their work, instead focusing on the consequences of alternative drug policies.  The result is a persuasive case for policy reform in America that is not doctrinaire. Required reading for all who are interested in illicit drug policy in America
