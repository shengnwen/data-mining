This book is great for anyone that is just starting off in the business realm. I'll assume that whose who gave bad reviews on this book are people who already have a good amount of expereince in the business world. For them this book is just too basic of information that they already know. I, on the other hand, am just starting out in the world of business. I am 21 years old and this book was perfect for me in teaching me the basics and where I need to go to get some of the information I need. This book was also very motivating for someone starting off like myself. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone that wishes to begin learning about what it takes to buy and sell a business.
