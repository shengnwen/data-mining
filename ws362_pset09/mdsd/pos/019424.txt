Johnson's work is a necessary and counter-balancing discussion of globalization.  Before reading this book, I read "The Lexus and Olive tree" by Thomas Friedman.  Anyone who's read Friedman will be familiar with his argument that globalization is good, all the time, for everyone, and that anyone who does not embrace this inevitable trend is a moron and doomed to poverty and irrelevence.

Johnson points out the fallacies in this argument and shows how the concept of globalization is really just a cover for continued economic dominance by Western powers.  He then makes a strong case for how the US has reverted back from a temporary focus on economic dominance, after the end of the cold war, to a militaristic one.

The only downside to this book is the Johnson overdoes it a bit in bouts of overzealousness.  These rants tend to weaken his case rather than strengthen it.

In fairness, Friedman's rants are based on far, far less evidence (although they are far more entertaining too!).  This is probably because Friedman is a journalist, and a better writer while Johnson is a scientist, and a much better analyst
