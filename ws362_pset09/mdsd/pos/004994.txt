Very well organized, comprehensive information.  It's very useful and actually quite engrossing.  I knew nothing about birds and am doing research for a novel.  I first encountered this book in the public library and decided to buy myself a copy of this one among all the other bird books I borrowed.  I am not a bird watcher and I don't think I'll take it up as a real hobby, but this book has given me a great appreciation of birds.  They are fascinating and truly remarkable creatures
