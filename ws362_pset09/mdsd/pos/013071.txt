This is an amazing book I recommend anyone from any culture.  It's not a book that tells you Dos and Dons, rather a journey of an American pastor who was preaching about marriage, sex, love and God in Africa.  I am especially impressed towards the end of the book when the good Christian African man, Maurice, asked weather if he was wrong as a 30 year old virgin to dumb his ex girl-friend because she was not a virgin.  Good for Maurice to stand firm before God against temptation.  But there are too many Maurice, justifying women who have a different path of life, which might be so wrong, but in needed for forgiveness and acceptance.  The books raises a lot of tough and true questions, which sometimes is hard for us to even form.  For me, it was tough for me to explain to my boy friend why I think it is problematic for him to not think about marriage, and keep saying that he will seek God first.  It's contradictory.  Do you not love a child because you want to love God first?  Both can come as a practice.  Practice how to love God and humble ourselves in marriage.  To serve one another, the best way to display our love for God. 

In the book, another character, Fatma, a beautiful young women, just like the Samaritan woman who met Jesus on the way to the well written in the New Testament.  She and her 6 ex bf/husband, and still living with another man, non of them is her husband.  This beautiful woman could not see a way out, do not find a place in God even though she was searching.  This story of Fatma is also true to many women who became a Christian later in her life or was lost on the way as a Christian.  How women like that may think the best way out is to commit suicide, because her body and soul are wounded, so wounded and dirty, that, abandoning it is the only way out.  This is the best book so far I have read about sex, forgiveness, marriage, love and God.  It's not a self help book, but I would recommend to anyone in any age.
