My dad bought me this book when I was 8, and from the first recipe I was hooked.  Between my brother an me, our family enjoyed most of the recipes in the book at least once, and I loved the sense of accomplishment from making my own meals.  The book is extremely well-made and sturdy.  I'm now 25 and the book is still in good condition.  Recipes are easy to follow, fun to make, and surprisingly rather delicious.  Though I no longer use it, I'll definiftely be giving it to my kids.
