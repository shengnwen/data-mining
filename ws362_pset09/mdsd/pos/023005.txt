I saw Billy Wilder's 1948 movie before I read the original 1936 novel by Cain; the movie was exceptional - well paced, taught storytelling. The book is even better.

This is a simple story of love, murder, and insurance fraud. But the complexity of the written landscape by Cain is absolutely engulfing. Walter Huff, a scheming, self-serving insurance agent falls for Phyllis and they scheme to kill her husband for love and the insurance check. But, of course it is never that easy!

With snappy, well constructed dialog, Cain spins film noir better than any camera can
