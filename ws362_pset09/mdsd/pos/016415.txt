time &amp; go with the audio(albeit abridged) version.I figured it would be light &amp; easy. Not that Gleen isn't smart. It's just that there is no pretense to the man. His stories are interesting if his delivery leaves something to be desired. They reveal little about the inner man. It is a standard, straight ahead autobiography of a man who isn't a writer. He was sucessful in several different fields then retired to do the best part all over again. Hero is an overused word today. But he a real one. That's a go. So are his memoirs
