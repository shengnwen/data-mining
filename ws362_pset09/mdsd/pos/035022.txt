The spare, clean language of Haslett's book belies compassion behind his non-sentimentality.  This is a rare gem and easily one of my 2 favorite books I read last year (along with Flanagan's &quot;Gould's Book of Fish&quot;).  Haslett has exceptional talent and an ability to transcend the work of the people he admires (e.g. Munro).  The perfection of his characterizations, the suspenseful tension of his storytelling, along with uncanny pacing are an inspiration to any writer.  In the tradition of Capote, Kuralt and others, Haslett makes his finely honed language seem effortless (though I read he wrote full-time for 4 years to create this collection) and lets his unusual characters tell their stories.  He's also done an exceptional job of creating non-cliched characters who none-the-less ring true.  I'm envious!  He's one of the finests writers I've read in ages
