Alderman is one of those rare combinations of artist AND teacher.  The photographs grab you first.  The charts are clear.  The explanations are detailed enough for beginners.  The various weave structures are charted for 2-, 3-, 4- 6-, 8-, and more-harnesses, as each structure may allow.  Those new to weaving might find the directions less intimidating if they read the first two chapters before skimming the later chapters; the explanations will make more sense.  This is a good boost to your creativity as well as a source to better understand weave structures
