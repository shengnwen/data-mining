Openings are the realm of the beginner understanding basic Chess theory.

Middle games are the realm of the intermediate player mastering strategy and tactics.

End Games are the realm of the Chess Master.  It's not enough to have a theoretically won game.  You have to actually be able to finish your opponent off and translate it into a victory.

Once you begin to understand the end game, your view of Chess in the openings and middle games will change because you will begin to see the small advantages that accrue from seemingly innocuous moves.  Chess will begin to come alive and your enjoyment will increase.

Of course, to reach that point is not easy and for all but the few who are seemingly born chess prodigies, you have to learn.

Fine's book has been the standard work for Chess end-games ever since he wrote it in the 1960's.  Since that time there is no question that there have been many innovations and corrections found.  That is the reason for the 4 stars instead 5.  But those issues are well documented in many sources and when you are ready for them you will be able to find them and supplement your knowledge.

This still remains an outstanding work to begin to work through the different types of endings.  The book is encyclopedic, very well organized and the "errors" that are there are such that if you were to master the material in this book you would still be an extraordinary player and able to "fix" the issues that are there.

This is not a book for the lightweight chess player.  If you are not at least an 1700 level player with the USCF or FIDE, there are more profitable ways to spend your time than with this book.  As you begin to approach Class A and Expert level, however, you will need what this book has to offer.  This is very much a major part of the pathway to Chess-Master
