Patrick Hynes has written a valuable book that explores a much maligned, misunderstood and unjustly scorned segment of America: the Religious Right. At 30 million strong, they are not only the backbone of the Republican Party, which has taken the GOP from the minority to solid majority status, but also the guardians of traditional American values that have been an integral part of American life since the beginning.

The Religious Right is not some new interloper group attempting to impose strange and foreign values upon an unwilling America, Hynes asserts. That description justly belongs to the liberals and assorted leftists who are pushing gay marriage, evolution (to the exclusion of all else) and abortion while at the same time attempting to erase God from American public society. 

But this book isn't merely Hynes' opinion. What makes the book valuable is he backs up his thesis by drawing on polling data, studies, interviews, analyses, election results and voting trends. Particularly valuable is his report of just what the Religious Right is: it crosses all races, all levels of education, all income brackets and all 50 states. 

Not every aspect of the Religious Right is explored here, but that's not the book's purpose. The primary goal is to offer a stirring defense of the Religious Right's role in politics and American society, both against the continual and often vicious attacks from the cultural, secular and political left, and the dismissive attitude from some on the right. 

Hynes' ultimate conclusion seems to be: If you're Republican, you ignore the Religious Right to your peril, not because it's a voting block to be pampered, but because it embodies Middle America. If you're Democrat, you ridicule them to your despair, because you can't fake it, nor can you win a battle of the Scriptures against them
