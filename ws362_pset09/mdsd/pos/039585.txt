...but hey, let's get cracking. You won't read this crisp title from cover to cover but it's a handy companion when you feel like putting things off or are just in a slow mood. Some recommendations are better than others (I am not signing a contract with myself anytime soon, for instance) which is why one star is knocked off my review, but they are all spaced out in a very simple to read manner. Overall a pretty handy slap on the behind for lousy time managers like yours truly
