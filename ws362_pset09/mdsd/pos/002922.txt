The series features Israeli spy/art restorer Gabriel Allon and his mentor the legendary master spy Ari Shamron. The story continues at full pace as the Palestinian terrorist/archeologist Khaled al-Khalifa is hunted down and eliminated. There are several interesting female characters along the way. The pages keep turning almost on their own. Really an excellent read
