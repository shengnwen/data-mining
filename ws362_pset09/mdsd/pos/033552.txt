If you are a grown-up and want context for your travels, this series brings it.  They figure, reasonably for me, that you already know how to shop and that club-hopping is not the be-all and end-all--and that, if it were, you would probably be able to suss all that out.  

No no no.  Paris has history and you get a well-digested if detached version of it.  Paris has neighborhoods that were villages, and you get a nicely laid-out approach to each, including well-marked maps and a variety of delights in each.  Paris has a wealth of all kinds of cultural attractions, and you get a sense of many many many of them (and how to get to them).  Paris has flavors, and I find the authors' characterizations accurate and evocative.

I admit that I find the lists of restaurants disappointing, in that those listed are very very safe and therefore less interesting, but I am good at reading a restaurant from its menu, and enjoy going to places where English is not spoken and where the locals hang out.  Others might find the establishments exactly what they want.

By the way, the editors are scrupulous about updating information and maintaining accuracy.  I wrote to them about a minor error, and they not only responded, but thanked me with a freebie.  Great attitude, and it shines on all the (glossy high clay-content) pages.  In fact, that is my only real complaint about this book:  it is a heavy little package, and I would not want to carry it around with me.  As a reference, however, it is very fine indeed
