I would give this book three stars. Originally I did not want to read this book now that I finished reading it I feel much more educated about Islam as a religion.    J.T.
 
*****  My Review:  The book was written from the point of view of a non-follower of Islam. The author builds what appears to be a logical argument for Islamist desire to kill me or at least subjugate me. It would be interesting to do some follow on reading of the Koran, books that Islamists don't want me to read, and perhaps a couple of books by Islamists who make the argument that Islam is a peaceful religion (if there are any). I'm glad I read it and I recommend it for a deeper perspective into Islamic thought.   W.P.
 

****    
I would rate it a 4.  I'm not an avid reader although I enjoy reading once I get into a book.  I think a lot of people don't understand the Muslim people & especially their religion.  Even looking back at the Crusades & how that evolved along with the Muslim religion was a very important part of history.  Of course, it is very necessary that you learn about your enemy; however, it is barbaric for them to kill anyone who doesn't follow their faith & hope they can conquer the world all in the name of Allah.   I will have to finish reading the book in order to get a complete assessment but the author reveals the truths that many of us don't want to face.   E.S.

I came into this book critically mindful of the slant that it unabashedly titles itself - believing that it's goal is meant to shock.  I believe there are some leaps of logic.  The author didn't clearly define what was authoritative for the religion and so some of the proofs given left me wondering, for example next to the Quran how authoritative are the Hadith? When the author says that the speaker is one of authority in Islam, how far reaching and broadly accepted is that?  However, with the Quran in hand I was astonished to see that the verses were not taken out of context and so I found them the most convincing evidence for what I would consider his two main theses: that Islam's intention or mission statement for the world is conversion, dhimmitude (subjugation) or death.  Secondly, that moderate and liberal Islam either rejects or does not know the Quran.  However the author does not make a clear and sound case for the connection of jihad to violence
