As the daughter of Cuban parents, I grew up in a completely Cuban home in the middle of Queens, NY. While these recipes are wonderful and helped me introduce my Non-Cuban husband and children to the wonders of a home-cooked Cuban meal, the descriptions at the beginning of each chapter did get a bit nauseating. ENOUGH about how her family was of the high aristocracy!! Get to the recipes, already!! The chicken and rice recipe is fabulous and a huge hit with everyone I have made it for - excellent for a pot luck or large buffet lunch or dinner. Enjoy and happy cooking!
