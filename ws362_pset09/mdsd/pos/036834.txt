This is one of the best books on the subject of gay relationships available.  Honest and direct and full of good detail.  A great explanation of the coming out stages and warnings about culturally destructive interventions.  While just reading this book will not qualify a straight therapist to work with gay men, it is a must read for graduate students to experienced therapists.  Highly recommended and full of useful information
