I bought this book in 1997, made many of the truly excellent recipes, but somehow forgot about it -- the result, I suspect, of my hobby of (addiction to?) purchasing cookbooks.  But, while searching for something different to fix for 2005's Christmas dinner, I remembered Patricia's recipe for "City Steak" and, voila, we enjoyed a marvelous meal of City Steak, Fake Frites and Cheesemaker's Salad -- so easy, so delicious!  

Thumbing through my copy and the contemporaneous notes I always write for each recipe tried, I was reminded of how we happily devoured the Amazing Sorrel Soup, Turnip and Cumin Puree, Monsieur Henny's Eggplant Gratin, Checchino Dal 1887's Spaghetti alla Carbonara, Steamed Salmon with Warm Lemon Vinaigrette and the Beef and White Wine Daube from Arles, to name a few.  I suspect this book will now be a somewhat permanent fixture in my kitchen since there are dozens of recipes I can't wait to try -- even the breads and desserts that usually don't interest me.  Yes, it truly is a treasure.
