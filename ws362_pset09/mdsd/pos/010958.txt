This book was quite the page turner for anyone with an eating disorder, or just wanting to understand an eating disorder.  The amazing story of one man's journey not only with binge eating but with life itself.  It is very easy for me to read a book and stop if the book doesn't grab me.  I was awake all night reading this witty any exceptionally well written book.  Hooray Ron, you've got me hooked!
