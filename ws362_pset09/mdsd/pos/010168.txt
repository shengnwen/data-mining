I think its so sad when children say &quot;i cant draw&quot;... when all they need is someone to show them that it is easy and fun!  This book is fabulous for the beginning drawers in your life...i try not to go by the age ranges as people learn to draw at different stages... i showed this book to my son's teacher who was convinced she couldnt draw only to see the pride in he smile when she made a few little fun pictures...clearly she was re-thinking her artistic ability!   the pictures are simple as are the concepts but i think starting with the easy stuff builds self esteem and gives kids courage to move on the more difficult complex things..
