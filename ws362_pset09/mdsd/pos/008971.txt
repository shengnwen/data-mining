This has become my favorite book of all times. I saw the PBS movie version first and just had to read the book-- and it's ten times better than the movie! Romantic, full of adventure, and has some exciting history too. I can read this book over and over and over, and never get tired of it. The ending is so great, and Du Maurier has done an excellent job. It is most definitely her best book ever-- I enjoy it as much if not more than Rebecca
