This book really allows us to 'see behind the curtain' of what is going on in a 'typical' birth! Every pregnant woman owes it to herself and her baby to read this book.  Every Doula, husband, friend, sister or anyone that will be in the birth room needs to read this book and believe it.  Being prepared is being calm and sure of yourself.  I have been a midwife for 16 years and have wanted and waited for this very book-since 99% of the birthing public births in a hospital, 99% of you NEED THIS BOOK! Ms. Hawk has dared to tell us the accurate details of what happens from the moment you find out you are pregnant to the first excited call to the hosptial when you think you are in labor to all that can and will happen; once you arrive at the hospital in labor if you are unaware of the 'routine' that awaits you.  She also lets us in on, "I don't know how it happened that I ended up with...."; she points out how other agendas affect your decisions and birthing outcomes, often every step of the way.
I have been GIVING this book out to all of my clients and all of my students.  When everyone understands what is really going on, we all win!
