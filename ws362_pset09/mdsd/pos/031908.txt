It would be wonderful, if what Mr. Cayce realized, were the truth. As to the book, it isn't bad. It reads more like a novel, than like a biography. A little slow of a read but then most biographies are. I like the fact it did not embellish the character. It seemed to tell the facts the way they were. Probably not the end all of Mr. Cayce resources, but overall a good book
