This did help us pick our baby's name, but not directly.  It provided endless lists to go through, but almost no information on each name like meaning or popularity.  We relied on other sources more, like the Baby Name Wizard, www.thinkbabynames.com and family names to help us come to a decision.  If you want a book with lists and lists of names, this is for you.  If you care more about meanings, popularity, roots, etc. then you still may like this book, but plan on supplementing it with other sources.

Happy naming!
