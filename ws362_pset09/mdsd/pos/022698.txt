Wooding, Chris 
Summary: 
	Thaniel Fox, son of Jedriah Fox, London's great wych hunter, is a seventeen-year-old boy who also is a wych hunter. With his friend and mentor, Cathaline, Thaniel tracks down the horrifying creatures that lurk in the Old Quarter of London. This is where Thaniel, while on the hunt, finds a scared girl his age named Alaizabel Cray. 
	Alaizabel is beautiful but an evil spirit that a secret brotherhood wants to free possesses her. Ms. Cray is a magnet that pulls evil to her and if the brotherhood has its way darkness will fall upon the entire world. Cathaline and Thaniel must discover the cause and drive back the foul creatures. 
	This book is not for the faint hearted for it is full of dark suspense and a Gothic feel that is set in Victorian England with a chill that will steal away your heart and make you want to read more. It is not a bedtime story. 
Recommendation: 
	I think the people who will like this book are mystery and horror lovers as well as teenagers.
