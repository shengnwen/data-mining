	Have you ever wondered what happens if you give a pig a pancake?  I'll tell you what happens - a big mess!  If You Give A Pig A Pancake by Laura Numeroff is what I call a great comedy on how a pig keeps on asking for things until he and the girl...nah, I wont tell you it because it'll ruin the surprise of the book for you.  

	In the book, the pig shows up on the girl's window during breakfast, so the girl gives him a pancake.  Then the pig keeps on asking for things and all sorts of stuff happens to them.

	My favorite part of the book was when the plot.  The girl goes into hard labor because of the pig.  I think that this is important because it helps you see what a tough time the girl is going through.                                                                                               

However, I find that the book was very long.  I think that the girl and the pig go through too much.  But this doesn't change much about what I think of the book.  Never the less, I still think it's a great book.

I believe that this book is great for a kindergartener that is starting to read, just for fun, or if you're in the mood for a hilarious and comical book.  I personally love it and I recommend some other Laura Numeroff novels like If You Give A Mouse A Cookie or If You Give A Moose A Muffin.
