 Worth a look nonetheless, for it is the genre of these books which is so amusing and intelligent. I get so tired of this notion that by acknowledging the purile, wicked and taboo we somehow become all of those things ourselves and worse still, evil. These books encourage us to see the natural and lighter side of wicked and intrusive humour. Far healthier to do so than claim not have such thought or feeling because it's inhuman, it is very much so human! What better way to develop greater understanding of your own mind than through humour?
 Incidently, to any detractors of this theory, no actual little fluffy bunnies were hurt in the making of these books!
