   Not his best, but a darn good read.  Neal Stephenson, Boston U class of  '81, made the most of his time at B.U. by writing his first  partly sci fi novel.  University life starts out as ordered chaos and gradually builds to a wild crescendo of open warfare in the lunatic asylum.  Nothing is held sacred, well except for the Big Wheel Oil sign, in reality the Citgo sign in Kenmore square.  Interestingly, it was actually turned off from 1979 to 1983, by Governor Ed King to save electricity.  The book is full of gems such as an attempt to pie President Krupp (John Silber?), a brilliant computer nerd battling it out with an immortal computer virus, dungeons and dragons played in the sewers under B.U. infested with giant rats, and an incredibly bizarre method to raise money for the University (Silber again?).  Laced with humor, some scares, but never a dull moment.
