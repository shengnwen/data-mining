John Gray, for any who have had the pleasure of seeing him in person, is an absolutely amazing speaker. He is a genuine person who cares about people. He's funny, he's highly intelligent, and he really understands the fundamental differences between men and women. We are truly different creatures. 

He created the Mars and Venus Wellness Solution as an all natural alternative to prescription medications for depression, bipolar, ADD, ADHD and similar issues.  John teamed with Isagenix, an international Health and Wellness company that I also represent, because he found that his personal experience with Isagenix products was that they helped to "create the brain chemistry of health, happiness, and lasting romance" - the very foundation of his work with men and women and relationships. John worked with our formulator to create a new line - the Mars Venus Wellness Solution, "the first and only program ever created that's designed to support healthy brain chemistry while considering the unique and special needs that make men and women different."

These products are fabulous. This is what the book is about. This is not an attempt to market on the weight loss craze - it is a natural progression in John's work to help men and women become healthy physically and emotionally.
