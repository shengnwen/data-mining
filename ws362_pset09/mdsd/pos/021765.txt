Even though L.M. Montgomery did not intend Anne of Green Gables to be a series, she still captivates with her eager readers in Anne of Avonlea.
	There are still quite a few differences, Anne has grown from a "queer", fiery, young girl to a wiser, calmer, auburn-headed schoolteacher. Yes, a schoolteacher. Also, as we follow Anne in this Bildungsroman literature, the romance between her and Gilbert Blythe peeks through shyness and past misadventures in this novel. 
	Some people consider it a book not as interesting as the first, and perhaps this is because Anne is no longer a child and could not grow into a young woman with the same inexperienced attitude. 
	Altogether, my opinion of the book is that it was a good follow-up and I sympathize that it would be hard to make up such great a book as Anne of Green Gables.
