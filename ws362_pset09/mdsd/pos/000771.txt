As a fairly new student of Buddhism, I found this book to be a very useful tool in furthering my education &amp; undertstanding of the religion &amp; philosphy. After 20 years in Korean Buddhism, my Lama also decided this  book would be of great use in further enriching his studies in the  understanding.  This has proven to be a good reference tool for any level  of interest in Buddhism &amp; Zen in its depth &amp; knowledge of terms
