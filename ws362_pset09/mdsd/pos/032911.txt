This book start of pretty simple with a family being killed and there house torched, but then thing get interesting as the DEEP story line starts to open up. This is only the second prey book I have read, the other one being Rules of Prey, and I thought this was a great book. This is just a good book all around, they way Mr. Sandford jumps from charecter to charecter is smooth and isn't confusing at all. A real page turner with new evidence and suspects being thrown at you, but not in a way that will leave you saying "What! Where did he come from? or How does that have to do with this case. The only problem I have was the few parts that talk about the previous case that Lucas talks about. I guess its from the previous book and I havn't read that one, but don't worry these books seem that its okay to read out of order you just may be confused on a couple of paragraphs. Anyway I loved this book and will be reading more John Sandford books in the future.
