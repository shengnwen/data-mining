I'm just a student in high school, and not long ago was recieved the part as Lady Macbeth for our school play Macbeth.  My drama teacher recommended this book to me to get an in depth analysis of my character and the rest of the play.  I bought the book and I was totally blown away.  The information packed in here is tremendous.  In this book is everything you'll ever need to know about each play and every character, even if they don't have a speaking part.  This book has also helped me with the other Shakespeare plays I read during school for Literature.  It's a great study and reference.  It's helped me understand so much about the characters and the play, I recommend this to anyone who reads Shakespeare for school or anything, this tells you things even your teacher wouldn't know.  It's been truly a life savor, to me and the rest of my cast who couldn't understand what was going on or what their character was about
