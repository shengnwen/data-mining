For those of you that are into personal development and self improvement, I have to tell you about a book that I just finished reading it at 12:30 at night that I could not put it down.  It is without a question the most powerfully simplistic, compelling and motivating book next to the Bible that I have ever read.  For those who are interested, you can buy it used on Amazon.com for $3.00, and if you cannot afford it, email me your address, and I will buy it for you and mail it to you
