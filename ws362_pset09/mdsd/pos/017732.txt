Ellis' book is excellent and a must read for anyone concerned about equity between the genders.  Ellis is perhaps too critical of individual women he has known (no one is perfect) and too quick to ascribe their short-comings to feminism, never-the-less his basic arguments that feminism encourages misoandry and discrimination against men are well made and undoubtedly right.  Discussions of the book with my balanced wife, who likes men, has led me to believe that there is hope of a middle-way to gender equity, but Ellis convincingly argues this will never occur through feminism
