I loved this book.  It had some historical references, which tends to bring a story to life as one can relate them to familiar or current events.  It didn't have typical hollywood ending, but it was a good ending nonetheless.  The main-character was a bit underdeveloped, mentally and emotionally; thus I couldn't really feel sorry or bad for him
