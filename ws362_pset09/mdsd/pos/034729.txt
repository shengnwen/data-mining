This is a fun book for those of who like to sit around and swap sea and fish stories.  It has a lot of interest and a very "easy read".  Linda also gives you a feel for the "community of North Atlatnic fishermen" that participate in this often very unforgiving and dangerous profession.  This book is clearly the best of her books that I have read.
