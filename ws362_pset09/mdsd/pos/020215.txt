Sooner or later every beautiful rural American Town will have to deal with the threat of a corporate Goliath like Wal-Mart invading their community.  Al Norman's book Slam-Dunking Wal-Mart educates, not only citizen groups,  but Planning and Zoning Boards across the country.  It also assists them in  directly dealing with these inevitable imposters to the quietude of Rural  America.  If you can't get Al Norman to come to your town (you might be  able to if you contact him) - this book is the next best thing.  Mr. Norman  and his book are presently bringing the Warning Light to the Town of Red  Hook, New York (upstate New York, about 60 miles south of Albany).  Believe  it or not, everybody's listening to Wal-Mart's nemesis. Slam-Dunking  Wal-Mart is a must read for community activists and Planning Boards alike
