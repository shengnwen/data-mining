This follow up book to the SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE (Covey), repeats a lot of the same ideas in this title.  However, it applies the ideas in a slightly different way and is a useful read who want to enforce the difficult to develop seven habits and apply them on an organizational level.

I particularly liked the way Dr. Covey handled the discussion about the two "must have" qualities of any leader -- character and competence.  The former of these two is often forgotten in today's rough and tumble business world.

While there is redundant information in this volume, I found it to have enough new information to be a worthwhile read.  I also found that the way the repeated information was presented made it interesting to review.  I don't think you can go wrong buying this book, it contains many worthwhile ideas and case histories to ponder that will spark your own creative thinking
