Unlike many of DeLint's formulaic novels where his main character finds themselves up against an evil from some ancient past, this deals more with the heart, Jilly's Heart, to be exact. It was a delight to see him stray from what seemed to be a habitual path of the formulaic for this writer. I had become somewhat of a discouraged reader due to his constant plot repetition and poor resolutions of these plots. It was refreshing to see him finally break free of this and try something new.

Jilly, is perhaps, one of the most endeared characters in DeLint's Newford sorties and I was delighted to see that he finally took the step into letting us know about the family and past history of this beloved character.

This book can be ready without reading any of DeLint's Newford stories, but those who already have will find great joy in seeing many of the old favorites coming to visit Jilly while she is in the hospital.

A story more about regret and following the paths one is given, this has less to do with DeLint's normal "urban fantasy" style and more to do with the complexities between siblings, child neglect and incest. There is more context to this story and more fleshing out of Jilly than one had before, which, is still overwhelming.

A very sad and haunting story of two sisters caught in the same situation, it is an instersting trip into the human psyche as to how both characters deal with it.

The ending was sad but redeeming as it comcludes that above all, family is everything
