Contrary to most people, and even to my own expectations, I liked The Regulators more than it's sister book Desperation. 

Of course, neither are King's best work.  However, buying both of them from the bargain bin several years ago, I felt they were worth the minimal $$ paid as well as the considerable time spent reading them.  

Overall I felt The Regulators moved at a faster and more exciting pace which helped keep my attention and enjoyment.  The story as well, I found a bit more suspenseful and interesting.  I'd recommend this book to King fans, as something worth trying.  For someone looking to get into King and who haven't read any or much of his work before, I'd instead recommend Rose Madder, Gerald's Game or Pet Semetary.
