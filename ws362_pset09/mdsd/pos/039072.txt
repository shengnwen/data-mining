To put it as simple as possible, Tender is the Night is the story of a man and woman in a codependent relationship. She needs him for stability and he needs her to feel useful. A relationship like this is unhealthy, therefore, it can't last. But the two involved are the last to know.

The story starts off with the actress Rosemary, not the principle characters Dick and Nicole. This is done for a reason. Fitzgerald wants us as the reader to be introduced to the couple the way the world would. We're supposed to see Dick and Nicole as the glamorous, sophisticated couple who are rich and happy--hence, from the outside. Only as time goes by do we see them for the flawed individuals and disturbing couple they are. Dick loses himself in his attempt to be the rock to his emotionally and mentally disturbed wife. I'm still not sure how medically accurate it is for a woman to become a schizophrenic due to incest. But I digress.

Tender is the Night isn't as breezy as The Great Gatsby: it is more complex and longer; yet, it's not as good. Some of the characters here remind me of the empty, vacuous characters of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises: the so called "lost generation" who spend their time traveling and cavorting across Europe drinking and licking their emotional wounds while enjoying their expatriate status in the more "sophisticated" countries. Only, Tender is the Night is much meatier and more thoroughly enjoyable than Hemingway's drudgery.

Bottom Line: A thinly veiled autobiography of Fitzgerald that fails to be a masterpiece, but is still a worthy piece of work that I wouldn't be opposed to reading again
