Robert Musil may I remind you, was not a writer suited for the masses, he did not write to "entertain" people such as yourself who are bored by examination of a century, his century. His work is monumental in scope and it is truly extraordinary. Your review was taken from the back of a bookflap anyways because I don't see how you can so aptly describe it on one hand and then call it tedious.
