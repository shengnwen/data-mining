Before I picked up this book in the remainder pile it had been on my library list. I did enjoy it but I'm wondering how much of the story would have been better as told by the first persons. The author does cite a comprehensive set of references and now you can count on me digging at least some of them up. Why the skeptim? Because I read Owen's account of the sinking of the Whaleship Essex and frankly it's hard to improve upon the story. After all Owen was there and Patrick was not.

Still though worth the read. And at remainder prices, well worth it
