In spite of all the bloodshed and shame Catholicism has caused people over the centuries, Her Mother's Daughter is a fine example of the best of the religion. Linda Carroll is a very mystical woman and she related these experiences with a understated grace. Her description of her adopted parents, her ex-husbands and her disturbed and often cruel child was certainly an exercise in charity. Although she left the church at a young age she took the best of what she learned with her and  it has caused me to reflect in a kinder way on my own Jesuit education and the way it has influenced me for the good in my life. 
There is one scene when she is in a  morning Mass and she everything in the church becomes alive with color and light. I had that same experience as an alter boy and haven't thought of it again until I picked up her book.
ALthough I am ten years younger and a different gender, I can relate to so many things she talked about. 
Terrific read, I hope she keeps on writing
