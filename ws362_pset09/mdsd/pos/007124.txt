This book is a study of inner city life in some of the really bad areas of Philadelphia.  Its basic thesis is that the inner city culture is split between the majority who are decent and the large minority who are "street."  He explains the origins and meaning of all of this very well.

Anderson is not the best writer in the world, and the book goes longer than it should.  Bearing in mind that he is an academic, however, most of the book is pretty well written.  The high points to me are his stories about individuals he studied.  They really make the book come alive.

Anderson is a liberal, and that comes out now and again in his writing.  I do not think that his ideology interferes much with his analysis and understanding, however.  While the book has its liberal moments. it is basically a pretty solid book of analysis, written in an unusually personal and vivid way
