I have to admit to some personal bias in posting this review. A few years ago, I commuted from my home in Hampton, Virginia, down to North Carolina to take some composition lessons with Vince Corozine. Vince showed me  some preliminary chapters from a book he was working on and asked me to read and make some comments on what he had done. His goal was to  discuss contemporary arranging techniques and compare those techniques with the compositional style of the great composers of the western European tradition. I have just finished reading the complete book for the first time and I think that Vince fulfilled his goal admirably. In addition to being a master composer/arranger and an inspiring teacher, Vince is also a warm and generous person. These traits are in full bloom  in this book. Along with providing a wealth of information about arranging and composition, the tone of the book reflects Vince's joy of music making and his willingness to share his encyclopedic knowledge of the subject. I especially liked Chapter 6, A Brief Historical Survey of Orchestration, where Vince compares orchestration styles from the Baroque to the Impressionistic periods. Vince has included numerous examples from his own arrangements and original compositions, which reinforces the fact that this is no mere academic exercise. There are abundant musical examples in the text and an accompanying CD, which includes selections, most or all, arranged or composed by Vince. This book is sure to be a welcome addition to the literature , as both a manual of instruction and as a reference work in itself- a great contribution from one of America's outstanding composer/arrangers
