Easy French Reader fills a needed niche which satisfies the necessity of learning basic French through the reading of basic material.
The text is well thought out and quite easy to use.  I have learned a good deal of French from it and I highly recommend it.
I do recommnend however that you complement this handy little reader with one of my favorite French courses, Behind the Wheel French Revised.
The course comes with CDs for the car and a fabulous text for home study tha teaches you the practical basics, gives you immediate feedback, and even teaches you how to form and speak 'original' sentences in French.
