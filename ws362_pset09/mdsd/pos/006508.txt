This book is terrific for owners of any dog.  We actually rescued an dog-aggressive dog and actually went to Brenda Aloff for a few sessions.  Her advice and exercises helped turn a stressed out little monster into my little princess.  My dog isn't magically cured, but by using this book, we've taught her to look to her humans for guidance in stressful situations, instead of just attacking as she would in the past.  She knows the rules and was taught them in a completely positive reinforcement manner.  I highly recommend this book
