This book contains the clearest, most thought-provoking, intelligent discussion about upcoming shifts to not only our planet but also humanity. 
 
Penny Kelly underwent a kundalini awakening which expanded her awareness and enabled her to communicate with non-physical beings. Ms. Kelly began having visits around 1980 by little men in robes who looked like monks. They described in a non-judgmental, compassionate, yet highly intellectual manner the changes we will experience, and our human potential for exploring frequency waves beyond our normal abilities and expanding our consciousness.

Some of the Chapters include:
     - Earth is a Living Being
     - Break-up of Nations

I believe that if it were possible for one of the highest forms of consciousness to dip down to earth with messengers to communicate to the human race, the little men were a manifestation of this consciousness, bringing messages we need to hear right now.
