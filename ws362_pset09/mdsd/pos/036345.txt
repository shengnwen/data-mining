Patterson once again makes another very fast paced, action, and twist filled book. The difference in his past Alex Cross novels was there was only one huge murder investigation going on. But in Jack and Jill there is two. 
One involves a couple named Jack and Jill who are murdering famous people and people form the Government. Cross soon realizes that they are only practitcing for their biggest assasination yet. I'm not going to say anything but you have probably already figurd that out. 
The other murder investigation going on is a murderer who is killing kids from elementary schools. I will say this, don't expect a "mature" person to be the killer if you get what i'm saying. 
Towards the end around the last one hundred pages everyhting starts to unfold and nothing is slowing down as the chapters get shorter and you keep going from Jack and Jill's point of view to the Sojourner Truth School killer. Both are resolved with horrific ending and twists i guarantee you will not expect coming. I swear it. 
I was a little confused with Jack and Jill and trying to figure out who was the real Jack and the real Jill but you'll be able to figure that out. I definetely recommend this one as this is the most twisted Alex Cross novel yet. If you love murder, suspense, and twists like you wouldn't beleive then definetely pick this one up
