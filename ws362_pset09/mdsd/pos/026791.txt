After a good many years of resistance  due to its purported popularity and temptation due to its excellent cover, I finally yielded and read John Berendt's Midnight in  the Garden of  Good and  Evil.  The overly simple sentences of the initial chapter nearly caused me to throw it aside, but I got past that and found an excellent story that ultimately left me as bemused as fascinated.  The description of it as a "nonfiction  novel" was obviously an oxymoron, but I didn't  know what to make of it.  Then I saw The City of Falling Angels at a bookshop, bought and read  it, and realized what they both are--travelogues.  In fact, I was moved to read Irving's Tales of the Alhambra for comparison, and they clearly share the same basic organization:  a traveller [as distinguished from a tourist] sets out for and investigates a (figuratively or literally) insular place;  there is a thread running  through the narrative, and a concentration on local color.  

Compared to Irving's famous work, these two by Berendt are rather more stylistically complicated, with multiple subplots or digressions. Midnight in  the Garden of  Good and  Evil, being set in an American city, written by an American for an American audience, is the more powerful of the two because it conveys much by implication and reference;  The City of Falling Angels is written by a foreigner for foreigners and must rely upon necessarily less powerful explicit descriptions of an unfamiliar place and its people.  It nevertheless  remains  an excellent book;  it leaves one somewhat perplexed and  reflecting upon the vagaries, inconsistencies, and peculiarities of human character.
