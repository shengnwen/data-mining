I stumbled onto this book (actually a MP3 audiobook) based upon a recommendation of a friend. Though I consider myself to be fairly well versed in the history of technology, I had no idea about the background of early American space-based espionage.  I was just a child when America got serious about spying on the Russians.

This is a great book and blends story-telling with technical background information. I could hardly wait to get into my car and listen to more on the way to work and back. The book balances talking about the great triumphs of early American space efforts (U2, Blackbird, satellites) against the debacles and failures each program. You learn much about the actual people that made this all possible.

I highly recommend this book, particularly if you are new to this genre.  BTW, I had no idea which famous American inventor and industrialist was so closely associated with early spaced based reconnaissance efforts.  Enjoy
