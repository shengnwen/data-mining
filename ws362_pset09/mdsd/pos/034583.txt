I enjoyed this book a lot. I found myself interested in the main character, the L.A. community which is an integral 'character' in the story and the well-written supporting characters and street scenes.  I read one reviewer's comment that many of these scenes were cliched; what that reviewer overlooked is the timing of when the book was written--14 years ago.
