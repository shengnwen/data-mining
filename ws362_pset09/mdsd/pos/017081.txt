This was a terriffic book - which highlights the confusion and craziness of the borderline personality.
Truly Alex, at times seemed borderline - 
When treating a borderline personality, this is indeed how you feel - crazy.
Kellerman took us into the borderline's world - the confusion of reality/unreality, identity shifts, fragmented world and fragmented childhood.
Kellerman was brave to take on a storyline like this - combining borderline, at times what seemed like multiple personality (because of the three disturbed twins), the world of treatment and psychotherapy, as well as the fallout - as it affected others in the borderlines' worlds.

This was quite a feat!
Yes, at times it was confusing - and that's how working with borderlines is.
I had to reread parts of the book with a few of the twists and turns. 
Great book
