Edman has written an excellent title that documents the various struggles 20 Christians faced in moving from despair and depression based on self-effort to the abundant life found by letting Christ live His life through them.

Among the people mentioned include:  Oswald Chambers, Hudson Taylor, John Bunyan, Amy Carmichael, Dwight Moody, Ian Thomas, and Andrew Murray.  While these people were and are well-known in Christian circles, the author also includes other folks who while not as well-known, were also able to experience the abundant life.

Read and be challenged to stop trying to live the Christian life and instead let Christ live His life through You!

Highly recommended!
