I purchased the book after being introduced to personality types with information that I've found on the net and I really like it!  It really goes in depth with the description of the personality types.  There are little cartoons and the author makes reference to fictional or real people. It helps understand the types better.  I'm an INTP and I've found the description was accurate.  She offers solutions to grow and develop our weaker functions.  I had the impression that she was biaised toward Judgers, though...  She seemed to imply that they handled failure better...
