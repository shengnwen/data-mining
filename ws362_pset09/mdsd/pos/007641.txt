    I don't think this book can be read without bursting into uncontrollable belly-laughs with practically eevery turn of the page.  Don't expect rapier-like wit.  That's not what the author was trying to do.  It is verbal slapstick, and in this Bryson succeeds.  That, and his solid writing style, are the attributes which merit the five-banger.  
    It ought to be mentioned, however, that if the reader is expecting an accurate picture of what it was like to grow up in a place like Des Moines in the "fifties", he will not find it in this book.  Bryson said that there was no better time or place to grow up.  I've never heard the same verdict given by anyone who had actually endured the chore of growing up in that place at that time.  When I achieved adulthood, I moved a thousand miles away from Des Moines just so my children wouldn't have to grow up in such a sleazy place.  According to the biographical material I have seen, Bill Bryson actually did live in Des Moines.  But based on what I read in the book, I can scarcely believe it. Maybe being from the privileged "south of Grand" section has something to do with Bryson's tint on things.
     But that criticism is not important.  After all, the book was not presented as a documentary, but as a comic piece (including the obligitory anti-McCarthy diatribe which every author must include in a "fifties piece", and the bland recitation of common fifties stereotypes, e.g. attitudes toward smoking.  There did not exist, (Bryson's claim notwithstanding)  any individual in the entire universe in the 1950s who was not aware that smoking was bad for you.
     This was a great book.  I bought copies for several friends.
