I have tried to read the work of this amazing writer and more often than not find myself closing the book completely uninterested in the characters and/or the story.  Technically,  I can appreciate and even admit to the awe she inspires.  But for some reason her writing leaves me cold.

This was only the second of her books which I managed to finish and I genuinely enjoyed this novel very much.  The narrator is flawed and vulnerable, tough and offensive, and I wanted to know what would happen to her and to her gang.  

I like this book.  I will continue to try to read Oates whenever the impulse presents itself.  But I will also forgive myself if I am unwilling to finish what I start
