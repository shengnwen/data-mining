Well, I really enjoyed this biography of the Gonzo Master, but I have to warn potential readers that the work was written in 1994 and was then reissued in 2004. It's narrative ends shortly after 1990, and, had I known this beforehand, I would not have bought the book. This was a bit of a disappointment because the later years of his life are deservant of full chapter treatment--and then some. His suicide is a mystery that cannot be illuminated here so be forewarned. As far as Perry is concerned, the author's perspective is outstanding as he clarifies much of Thompson's enigmatic personality. The sources he selects are also very enlightening. This Fear and Loathing, just like the original, was wonderful, but Perry's tale is not definitive unfortunately.
