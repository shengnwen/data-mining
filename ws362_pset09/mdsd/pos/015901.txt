Michael McCabe is by far one of the finest cultural anthropologists our generation has seen.  His experience as a professional tattooist and his ability to tell a wonderful story make his books both relevant and enjoyably readable---which is not always the case with the THOUSANDS of published books that are supposedly about the tattoo culture.

I buy EVERYTHING and ANYTHING with his name on it, and I've never been disappointed.
