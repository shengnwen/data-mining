There is no doubt that Fluid Dynamics is possibly the hardest subject in Mechanical Engineering.  The reason, almost all situations in Fluids are non-linear.  It is important, for undergrads to realize that this book is  not intended for an introductory Fluids class.  notice that the title is  not &quot;Introduction to Fluid Mechanics&quot;, this is a graduate level  book!  If you are using this book for an intro level fluids book than your  professor either has no taste or he is trying to push you to be ready for a  graduate level course in Fluid mechanics.   Specifically, the author does a  great job developing the governing differential equations.  In particular  the Navier-Stokes Equations.  He not only describes how the equation comes  about, but he also describes how to take this non-linear, non-homogenous,  partial differntial equation with 3 equations (4 unknowns) and simplify it  to solve real world problems.  For those of you griping about how bad this  book is, I suggest you look at &quot;Introduction to Fluid Mechanics&quot;  by Fox and McDonald.  This book is excellent for the novice, then move up  to a &quot;real&quot; Fluids book
