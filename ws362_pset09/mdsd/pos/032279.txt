As I learned from this book, sometimes postmortem you too can be the life of the party.   Many see the horrid side of death as Dr. Maples has been witness to multiple times.  Not only does he share his thoughts on those that had tragic endings, he shares his wit and wisdom regarding those that continue to share humor with the world.  Some favorites to look for are why does a skull have tinsel on it or what is that jellyfish doing so far inland?  Dead Men Do Tell Tales can keep even a non history lover enthralled with the details of a past president or tsar.  Each chapter was well defined and contained, such that you can put the book down and come back to it for continued enjoyment
