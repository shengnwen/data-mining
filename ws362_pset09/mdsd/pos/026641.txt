"I just want to say thanks" is the most simple, thoughtful greeting any fan has ever given Neil - and that's exactly what I was going to do if our paths ever crossed. It's hard to say which is Neil's best book but I only have problems with the "travel log" style of writing. Paragraph after paragraph of too much info about stayed here, ate that. The best part for me personally was the frequent references to "Cuyahoga" as I am native Clevelander who fantasizes about helping Neil replace a flat tire on Route 2 and maybe buying him a milkshake. This book may be better than the others because of the frequent observations Neil makes about people he notices at shows etc. As for other reviewers being critical of Neil, look at the MANY other people in show business who are rude and you never know why. At least Neil is up front about it. Also, with every book, he does reveal a little more about himself. If you had a chance to see Neil on VH1 with Eddie Trunk, it was a jem. The one thing Neil seems to have never addressed publically is his spiritual beliefs. I have him pegged as an agnostic but I can only guess
