Although this book has been advertised as a book 'for women hurt by relationships everywhere,' I'm not a woman, but still found it interesting, helpful, and decidedly funny. 

There are two sides to every divorce. No, not male and female, but who decides to get a divorce first. That person has the advantage because he or she has already gone through the process of grief, anger, resignation, acceptance, etc. The non-originator has all of this sprung on him (her) after the initiator is through with it. 

Ms. Klein was, like me, the non-originator. So suddenly the perfect, well, not exactly perfect, marriage is over. What do you do now? Well, there's sitting at home alone. There's going out with the guys (gals). Then shudder, there's dating again. 

In her dating experience, Ms. Klein met some men that were real winners. I can assure you that the other side introduces you to just about the same set of characters but of the other gender. 

And in the end, you have to become happy with yourself first, comfortable with staying home alone, out with the guys, or on a date
