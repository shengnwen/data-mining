I bought this book as part of an evaluation process for the feasibility of a book that I am writing. Print on Demand has been a godsend to those of us who have something to say, but know that we don't have the next big seller. Aaron Sheppard's knowledge of Amazon is impressive. He is clearly an inquisitive individual and has done enough tinkering to know his subject. I would have liked to see a bit more information on dealing with Lightning Source. I also feel that his Perfect Pages book could have been merged with this book, for a more complete volume. Mr. Sheppard is in the business of making money, though. So I can understand his logic in creating two books.
