...but Richard Shenkman tries to give us the critical eye to spot it.  This book, though dated and somewhat sketchy in places, at least has the gumption to stir up controversy and allow us to see that history is not the cut-and-dried, "objective" science we've been led to believe.  The lists in this book are incomplete, they often contain unproven assertions, and sometimes are a little slipshod.  However, no claim is made that these are the final facts, but rather that these are alternate, iconoclastic views that allow you to approach history, not as a sponge to absorb the broad assertions of which teachers are so fond, but as a critically thinking human being ready to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Enjoy in good health and don't believe anything just because somebody told it to you
