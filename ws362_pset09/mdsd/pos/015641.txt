Our favorite federal park ranger, Anna Pigeon, heads deep into Mississippi for her new job as head ranger of the Natchez Trace.  Punchy from lack of sleep, it doesn't take Anna long to find trouble in the form of a drunken teenage girl.  She takes the girl in and returns her to her parents, thinking all is quiet until another teen girl turns up missing, and then dead.  16-year-old Danielle Posey is found in the woods with her head bashed in, wearing a KKK-style hood.  Anna, along with the other park rangers and the local sheriff, investigates, finding a web of intrigue laced with sexism and racism.  Anna pieces prom night clues together while musing introspectively about everything around her.  When she finally pieces it all together, she finds herself in harm's way and winds up fighting for her life.

Like the other Anna Pigeon mysteries, this one sort of ambles along through Anna's mind, all the while drawing us into a complex cast of characters, compelling intrigue, and a touch of danger.  This is a nice piece of the ongoing tale of Ranger Anna Pigeon as her life takes a new turn, but would serve just as well standing alone.  As always, Nevada Barr is recommended reading.
