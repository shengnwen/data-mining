As the founder and CEO of a successful market research-based consulting firm, I'm privy to the inner workings of a number of Fortune 500 companies. One of my perennial frustrations with books on business strategy is that the theories they present don't often correspond to the practical realities involved in running a large organization. The beauty of this book is that Vince Barabba's strategic guidance is informed by his first-hand experiences at General Motors. In drawing on his time at GM, Barabba makes compelling and insightful links between theory and practice.

As a business consultant, what I valued most was his 'systems thinking' approach to solving business problems--an approach that better ensures decision-makers identify and address core issues rather than merely tinker at the margins. This holistic approach to problem-solving goes beyond rote McKinsey-esque formulas and is what makes this book so broadly appealing. Using clear and forceful language (no annoying b-school patois here), Barabba gets right to the heart of things with a combination of robust theory and practical examples. Business decision-makers at every level would benefit from a close reading of this book.
