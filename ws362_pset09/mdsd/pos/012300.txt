I absolutely loved this book.  I have been interested in macrobiotics for over a year and this was the first book I read that made me laugh and excited to try out this way of life.  Jessica is a lovely author and makes you feel like you are talking to a friend instead of reading about health via the boring route.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more or continuing on the microbiotic path.
Cheers to all of our health
