In a very pithy, interesting discussion, the author discusses the various aspects of commodities, focusing significantly to dismiss some of the "hype" associated with it. The author reinforces the diversification and hedging benefits of commodities, the need to treat it as a separate asset class and asserts that a lot of money can be made, if done correctly. Point taken. However, the book doesn't really directly address the second portion of the title (how to profit..).  No specific investment vehicles or companies or trading strategies are discussed in detail. Limited mention of ETFs and mutual funds is mentioned (no specifics though). Perhaps, the question was supposed to abstract and the discussions at a fairly-high level. If that is the intent, the author succeeds in that (that minor issue takes away 0.5 star from this book!). If you are looking for an excellent discussion on commodities and an intelligent discussion on what the future may hold for it, this is a good book; however, if you are looking for specific recommendations, this book will disappoint you.
