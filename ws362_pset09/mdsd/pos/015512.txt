With the heated debate about intelligent design versus evolution, here's a book that weighs in, using literature as its foil.  And what it has to say makes remarkable sense.

The authors write, "Whether it is the self-sacrificial stinging of a worker bee or the willingness of adult zebras to defend a colt attacked by lions, we now see genes caring for themselves.  Armed with these same insights, it is also possible to make sense of those fictional tales in which people reveal desires and connections..."

Othello is not just a story about a jealous guy.  It's about sperm...the need for the sperm to make the most of its evolutionary prospects.  Nor is Madame Bovary a horny married woman.  She is the bearer of the egg, someone who wants her progeny to be fathered by a more appealing prospect...nt the dull Charles.

Over and over, the authors compare the species [...] Sapien to the other species of the animal kingdom, showing how our mating behavior -- indeed, other behaviors hardwired into our DNA -- are incredibly similar.  It is the height of hubris, according to the authors, to believe otherwise.

When one reads literature with the overlay of Darwinism, it adds a new dimension and another insight into our animal lives.  I highly recommend it for anyone who's not afraid of thinking
