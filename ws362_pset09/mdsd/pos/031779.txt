I am an 11 year old sixth grader. Hiding to Survive is a book about hidden children during the  Holocaust. In the first area of the book, there is a small summary about the Holocaust and hiding.  Paulette Pomeranz is the first hidden child to be written about. This is a very good book if you want to know something about hidden children.  	The bad part is that there is no telling if they died or not. That's a vital piece of information. I liked this book because I really care about people and I want to create World Peace 1
