If you believe in God from a Christian or Jew perspective, you can be enlightened and delighted with this thorough explanation of the psalm and benefit from taking the posture the psalmist(s) had when writing it.  I have listened to this psalm throughout my whole life and never had the opportunity to fully see all that may be found in its deep meaning. It is amazing all can be expanded from these simple phrases.
I usually love Harold Kushner's way of explaining spiritual material (Must read: "When Bad Things Happen to Good People", "Living a Life that Matters" and "How Good do We Have to Be") because, although his main point of view  is a religious one, even if you don't believe or don't even want to think about these points of view, you can still get the full message, get a wise vision of life, adversity, the laws of nature, reality, joy, ethics, reaching for self fulfillment and integrity, etc.  But, I must repeat, in order to enjoy and benefit from this book, I think you must believe in God because this one is much more religious than the other books I mentioned from the same author. If you want to understand what may be in the depths of the psalm and don't really care about feeling peace or living according to it, go ahead and read the book because it gives an interesting way of understanding what religion may provide or wants to give.
