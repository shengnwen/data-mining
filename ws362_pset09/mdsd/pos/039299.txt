I am a student at Macon State College majoring in Education.  I read Holler if you Hear Me and did a presentation on it.  The book was a collection of stories and events that occured during the teaching experience of Mr. Michie on the South Side of Chicago.  He revealed to me, teaching styles and methods that worked and those that did not.  His book strongly stresses the importance of teacher/student interaction.  He strongly urges teachers to get to know their students outside of the classroom, as well as in it.  He did teach in a very gang prominent area of Chicago.  Any teacher dealing with these types of situations in his/her classroom should definately read this book.  I found it very helpful
