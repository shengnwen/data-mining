When I was thinking of quitting my job and becoming a personal and career coach - I searched Amazon and found this book among others.  THIS was the book that gave me the shove I needed to go out on my own.  I now use it constantly as a reference guide in my coaching practice.  I have also had the pleasure of seeing Laura speak and her bold, tell-it-like-it-is style is so refreshing.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to make a change in their life
