What caught me about the novel was its ability to keep me on edge. Not from a plot generated position or in terms of character, but the author kept me on edge as to whether or not he was going to fail. At first, in introducing the story, my fear was that the author did not know what tone he wanted to take. Humorous? Humanist/absurdist? And this seemingly indecisive approach had me cringing for the moment these separate sympathies would collapse into all out nonsense. However and surprisingly, that moment never came. As the novel progressed, I was pleased to see that the author never flagged from his initial tonal indecisiveness; ambiguity in style reflected the oddness of the characters and their story's particular brand of humanism. More, by shifting between humour and whatever it is similar to cynical seriousness, the reader finds that paying attention to the narrative has turned into a game of sorts. Is this a funny part? Or should I feel guilty for smiling? How inappropriate is it, really, to laugh at the mentally deranged, the promiscuous, the assisted suicide? The novel was not without problems, of course. Aside from the protagonist, personal, stylistic details are sperad too thinly over the remaining characters. We know as much about the bus driver as we do the nurse as we do the guard as we do the roomate as we... You get the point. I think the novel would have been best served by developing a strong counterpoint to the main character. While a person may argue that everything in the novel is a counter to the confused Billy Schine, in not taking form as a character, per se, the counterpoint lacks punch to the point of being missed entirely. This narrative unevenness does detract from the overall strength of the novel. All the single aspects of the novel, however, combine to form a rather dense and enjoyable read.
