In this installment of Ethan Mordden's decade-by-decade series of books about the Broadway (and off-Broadway) musical, Mordden covers the 1960s. 

Perhaps because I know this decade's shows more intimately than I know most of the shows in the earlier decades Mordden has covered, I was surprised to discover a rather large number of factual errors in this one. 

And every once in a while in this book Mordden writes something truly bizarre, like his comment that the title song of "Cabaret" comments on "not voting when democrats oppose communazis in elections." Huh? Or his citing of the fact that "Hallelujah, Baby!" lost money even though it won the Tony for Best Musical, which is true but rather misleading if you don't also mention that it had already closed when it won the Tony.

As always, Mordden is a very entertaining writer. He is not shy about stating his opinions, but even when I disagree with him, I almost always enjoy reading him.

This is probably not a book for someone who doesn't already know the subject fairly well. I suspect most musical-comedy addicts will find it hard to put down, as you greedily wait to see what Mordden will say about every show. There are a few shows that Mordden doesn't cover (among them, "Billy" and "Something More"), probably for lack of space. This book definitely could have been a bit longer. But that is my main complaint, except for those factual errors and the several truly bizarre statements.

Isn't it great to want a book to be longer than it is
