Isaac Asimov's novel is based on the screenplay by Harry Kliener and a story by Otto Klement and Jay Lewis Bixby and is a very easy read. The world has been divided and battling for control for over half a century. A scientist, Benes, from the Other Side, has been vital in keeping the two factions of the world technologically even, and has now defected. He claims to have important information involving the fate of the world. Grant is the agent in charge of getting Benes to into the hands of the good side "With him in charge, I feel as safe as it is possible to feel, which isn't much. Grant ran the whole thing; flicked Benes out of Their hands like a seed out of a watermelon". However, while being transported to headquarters, the Benes is injured in an assassination attempt. Five scientists are shrunken and injected into Benes' blood stream. They must survive traveling through his body and successfully operate on a deadly blood clot in his brain. The "submarine's" journey is filled with dangers and challenges and it seems as though there is a traitor on board. "For every trick We've got, They've got a counter-trick; for every man We've got planted on Their side, They've got one planted on Ours." The only complaint is the mass amount of dialogue, the clich cast of characters might bother some people, but I thought they were humorous. Overall I found this book to be an easy-to-read, quick source of entertainment and recommend it to anyone looking for a fun read
