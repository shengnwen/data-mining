I hate reading reviews that are too long, so I'll keep this short and sweet.  For anyone who loves good food but doesn't have the time to really cook, I suggest you get a crockpot and this book.  Many of these recipes require more pre-pot preparation than more traditional crock pot recipes, but it's worth the extra time.  My tip is to prepare as much as you can the night before then finish the rest in the morning.  Dump it all into the slow cooker and go!  My only complaint is that I wish there were more recipes.  I like big fat recipe books with lots of variety.  The variety was here, just not the quantity
