Yes a bit pricey, but worth every cent. Have been through the tape that goes with the book, and the tapes on Reflex training drills.  Mr. Orlando is on the cutting edge with only a hand full of other martial artists.  I teach Aikido, after 911, I was not happy anymore with what and how I was teaching, so and I am trying to integrate some of the prinicples and techniques (yes you can see several if you watch the tapes long enough, oh and read the book) into what and how I teach.  GREAT STUFF!!!!  Larry Hartell's books (have 4 of them) are very very good also, but in a different context.  VICTORY CORPS
