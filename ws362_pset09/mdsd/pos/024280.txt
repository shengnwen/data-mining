The collection is quite useful as a reference. For example, if you want to find the text around a particular character in mythology, it will provide a very complete set of references and background notes. This is not the place to go if you would like to read the bigger stories as narrative.

For each myth fragment, Graves structures his approach by:

Recreating the primary myth
Citing the sources he uses for the recreation
Annotating his view on the origins and/or meaning around the myth

Be warned, Graves has his own ideas about history and the source of myth. Many people today can and do quarrel with these notions. It also is not always clear in his notes which bits are really well accepted by other scholars and which bits are his own interpretations.

However, The Greek Myths is remarkable for its comprehensive scope and clearly useful as a source guide. Take it for what it is, and it proves its worth
