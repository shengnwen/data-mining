This is actually the second edition to "Sierra Classics: 100 Best Climbs in the High Sierra," although it has a new name.  I gave the first one 5 stars and I feel just as strongly about this one.  There has been some minor tweaking of the route selections, but the total number described is about the same.

There is more narrative in this edition, and it is smoother reading. Way more than just a guide book, the many historical notes make the book very entertaining reading.  I think that many people, picking it up to find out about a particular peak or route, will extend their visit and end up reading it cover to cover.

There are more topos than before, and rock climbers will appreciate that.  Personally, I prefer the thrill of discovery in the Sierra, and would rather work out the details on my own.

As with the first edition, I am familiar with a number of the routes described in the book, and the authors have done a fine job of selection. While most of them are 5th class, class 3 and 4 climbs are also represented.  So there is something for everyone
