The People's Welfare is a wonderful tool to understanding the background of the federal and state governments within the United States. Topics include the purpose of the two separate governments, their unique functions and how they adapted (or didn't adapt) to social and economic changes throughout the developments of the United States.  The only problem with this book is that it perhaps does not address the existence of the police power in the federal government as much as it could have. Nonetheless, the People's Welfare is the place to start for those who are interested in the functions of government and the legal history of this country
