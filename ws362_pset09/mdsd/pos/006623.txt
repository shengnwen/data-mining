There are many prayer treasuries but this work stands out in several areas. First, it offers some intriguing categories such as: Prayers in Crisis,Prayers of Questioning, Prayers for Children, Prayers of and for Love and Kindness, etc. Second, this book contains many prayers of both children and adolescents and few similar books seem to consider young people's prayers important enough to include. Third, the children's prayers especially, are characterized by poignancy, humor, power, and honest emotion. Fourth, the editor includes information about many prayer authors and,in some cases, he even researched the occasion or crisis that sparked the prayer. This is an excellent, powerful, and moving volume. It should be on anyone's shelf who cares about God and how people relate to Him
