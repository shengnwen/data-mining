You'll find Bryson in good form here, always the witty observer and critic. 

The only criticism I have (and this applies to almost all his other travel books too) is that the sketch he includes of England (and I wouldn't dream of calling it a map) is woefully inadequate, if the point is to allow readers to find where in the country his travels take  him to.  In "Notes from a Small Island" the "map" is the size of a car key.  80% of the towns/places Bryson visits are not even shown on the pathetic key-sized sketch.  The irony here is that one of the tirades that appears in all Bryson's books concerns the deficiencies in maps he uses when he drives or hikes himself.  Granted the map in his books aren't expected to be used for navigating, but it would sure help if a reader could locate the places he describes in the book.  

All in all an entertaining trip up and down England.
