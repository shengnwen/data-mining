I too, was a recruit from the Antiques Road Show- they are the only reason I am interested in the show (they get so dang happy over a good find) and therefore the ONLY reason I grabbed this book.  

I am interested a little in antiques but MORE interested in a good "discovery" or score at a yard sale....  I found this book had it all - it is very well written and kept my interest the entire "read".

The brothers take turns between chapters and keep your interests in them completely equally.

I was also impressed just how their parents influenced them in such an "uncool" hobby, that ultimately led to their popularity and provided them both with success.

Many parents could take a few tips about being involved in their kids hobbies, and lives.  They not only were into antiques, but dirtbikes and fishing!  Just well rounded kids, and that comes from one place- attention from home.

Any how- I am off my soapbox.  I do reccomend this book because it is INTERESTING, it keeps your attention and both get to show their own personalities.

I read it and shared it... have found the same response: surprise that it was INTERESTING!  That we wanted to finish it.  I am so glad these guys are on TV, I really appreciate the knowledge they are willing to share with us.  That is why I like them; their lovely antiques packed minds!

Some brains are very attractive
