I actually finished reading this book in a day. It was a quick well written book.  It dealt with some serious subject matters that are probably still applicable to today's times.  However, I felt like the subject matter was handled through a beach read.  Everything turned out right with a big bow at the end.  Not true of real life.  It was however a fun read
