I got this set after reading an excerpt from the new biography of Grace Metalious in "Vanity Fair". I had never read the books, nor seen the movie or the TV series. I thought I would be in for some mildly entertaining reading, but was very pleasantly surprised to discover what a great writer Metalious was. She writes about the town of Peyton Place with beautiful descriptions (especially of seasonal changes in the weather and scenery, which she uses very effectively to develop the mood for each "episode") and delicious wit, but also with great feeling for her characters, loveable and otherwise. Her descriptions of the fashions and social customs of the 1930's and '40's are transporting. This is a great book to take one's mind off one's own cares and worries. 
"Return To Peyton Place", although enjoyable reading, is not as successful as its predecessor (the most glaring disappointment being that Metalious changed the name of one of the main characters after a lawsuit against her by a man whose name was a little too similar to that of PP's "Tomas Makris"). I wish the author had spent more time developing some of the plot twists introduced, and had explained what had happened to some of the characters from the original novel (e.g., Norman Page). The combination of these two novels in one volume, however, provides great entertainment, and is well worth the purchase price
