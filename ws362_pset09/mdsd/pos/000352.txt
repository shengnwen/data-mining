It took me a week to read,and enjoyed every minute of it.I like it when he said he's a writer now.I am a unknown writer so I understand.His nickname Pokey as a child was great.His writing was real,you went away from the book  with the feeling you know him.Better than the people you really know  because they don't write their life story
