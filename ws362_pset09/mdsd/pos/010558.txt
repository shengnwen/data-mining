This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to know the details of The Great War.  It has a nonstop plethora of pictures which take you through the entire war from the assassination of the Archduke to final day of fighting.  The book can be very detailed, describing or showing troop movements, horrific battle conditions, and casualty reports.  None of the major battles are overlooked.  Mention is also made to the fact that most countries were unprepared for 20th century warfare.  Major personalities are profiled in special pages of the book including the famous Red Baron.  Not limited to just Europe, Keegan describes the war elsewhere in the world including Africa and in the Pacific theatre.  War in the air is discussed including a special section on dirigibles and airplanes.  A must read for the serious student of WW I
