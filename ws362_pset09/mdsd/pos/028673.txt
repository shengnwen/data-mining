If you are looking for a very well written book that covers pretty much everything about the invasion of D Day from beginning to end this book is for you.

But if you are like me just looking for the battle performance of the invaders and defenders on D-Day and without haven't to read every single detail of how they got ready to get there, look for another book or start reading from page 196 "Cracking The Atlantic Wall" and skip the chapter "The World Holds its Breath" from page 486 to 508 where Ambrose talks of how people around the world heard and reacted to the news of the invasion.

So it was way too detailed and full of easily forgettable info at the beginning of the book than what I was after. For example, there are way too many pages about how many companies were trying to build the boats for the U.S army and what company got it right and why and on and on he went; if he wanted to emphasize that Andrew Jackson Higgins was the brain behind the famous "Higgins" boat that make the invasion possible he could have said it in few paragraphs.

Anyway it is a great book, a must read about the D-Day invasion but way too detailed for me
