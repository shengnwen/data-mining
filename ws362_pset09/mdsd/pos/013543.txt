"Communicate Clearly" is a small book packed with a lot of valuable and useful information complete with illustrations on the basics of effective communication. It covers a wide range of issues pertaining to communication including the communication process, improving listening skills, good writing skills, and effective presentation, conducting productive meetings, win-win negotiations and effective use of body language as well as using the latest information communication technology tools such as e-mails.

The book shows that anyone can learn to improve their communication skills, ranging from using the telephone to chairing meetings successfully. The book is very comprehensive and includes subjects that one does not usually come across in typical books on communication such as advertising effectively, use of neurolinguistic programming and how to read efficiently.

The book is small enough to fit in a jacket pocket so that one can easily read it whilst waiting for an airline flight or whilst in a queue for something. The book is a useful companion should one need quick reference, for example on the effective use of gestures or any other area of interest.

The advantage of the small size of the book is also its shortcoming. It results in the material not being covered in detail. This tends to limit the usefulness of the book to those seeking basic understanding of the important and critical skills of communicating effectively. For teachers or consultants in the field of communication, the book is a useful checklist to ensure that all the critical areas of the subject are covered.
