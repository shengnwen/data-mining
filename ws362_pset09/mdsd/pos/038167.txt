 "Beau Geste" is among the best fiction books that I have ever read. I first read the book in secondary school and it had a powerful and enduring effect upon me. I was so thrilled by the lofty ideals and values of loyalty, devotion, honour and duty displayed by the three Geste brothers, following the disappearance of the Blue Water sapphire.

When the Blue Water disappeared, each of the three Geste brothers confessed to having stolen it so as to protect the others. They then all proceeded to go and join the French Foreign Legion. The adventure then unfolds in its gory and moving detail. This is where the author demonstrates his genius in weaving a brilliant and moving adventure story that has withstood the test of time and has been enjoyed by several generations

I have read the book several times over the years but still get moved by this romantic and adventure story. I am always intrigued by the concept of the French Foreign Legion which was comprised of people of all nations where one did not need to reveal their true identity.

I highly recommend this exceptional book to anyone who loves adventure stories and those yearning to understand the values of honour, dignity, devotion, love, loyalty and bravery of yesteryear which are a rarity in these days of individual rights with no responsibilities.
