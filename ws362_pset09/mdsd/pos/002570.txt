This is not a book for everyone.  It is also not one that can be read only once and be completely understood.  In order to fully comprehend this book, one must approach it with a receptive mind, ready to interact with the  words.  This is not a book that simply allows the reader to sit back and  witness the story being told.  House of Incest challenges the reader to  search the depths of his/her consciousness.  Reading this book is like  reading one's own dreams and finally being able to understand.  The  language is beautiful and provocative.  I would recommend this book to  anyone that desires to know him/herself more fully
