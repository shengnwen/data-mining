Unique, well-written -- poignant, humorous -- subtle, yet compelling. Hubble's comic timing and keen storytelling are second to none. This is one of the most wonderful gifts I've ever received. Read it! Give it to every person you know. It's unique and so very lovely. I am grateful to the person who recommended this gem. A Book of Bees is a wonderful revelation. Ostensibly about bee-keeping, but really about life
