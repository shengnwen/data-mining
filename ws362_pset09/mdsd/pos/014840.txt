This book is perfect for youngsters learning their numbers.  (It's even good just as a picture book for infants.)  My son memorized the numbers 1-9 using this book by the time he was 18 months old - and as a 3 year old he still LOVES this book.  The pages have large numbers and colorful pictures that are just right for a toddler's attention span.  And the size of the book makes it east to take along to a restuarant, the doctor's office, in the car, etc. I highly recommend this book
