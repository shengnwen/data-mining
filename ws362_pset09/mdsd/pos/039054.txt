I read While I Was Gone first and loved it, this is my second Sue Miller book. It didn't instantly grab me as the first one did, but halfway though I really started to wonder about the story. It's the kind of book that is so subtly involved that it didn't seem like much was happening, but once you thought about it the ideas were profound. Every detail means something. Very unique and believable characters. Definitely worth the read, especially for Sue Miller fans
