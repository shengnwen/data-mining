We have all enjoyed this book immensely. I have a waiting list of friends who want to read it.
Everything you ever wondered about, about the construction and workings of the industries and infrastructure that supports Western civilisations, written in the most approachable, down-to-earth and, at times, humorous manner. Mr Hayes has obviously enjoyed this project himself and shares that enjoyment and sense of wonder with the reader.
A treasure
