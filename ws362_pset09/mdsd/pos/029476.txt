The LEVITY program and this program is extremely well-rounded. While the advice and some elements of the program seem like common sense, they really are helpful and to be reminded of them in a structured program like this is a great refresher. The exercise and supplement program really helps, and I am more conscious of how much better I feel when I am outside longer
