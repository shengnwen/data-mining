This is the sixth of the collections of Gould's essays from the magazine Natural History.  Gould has commented that, as he got better at essay writing, he found the earlier volumes less pleasing.  Certainly, as he went along, he improved both in literary quality and in the depth of his treatment of issues. Gould is amusing, but always with a serious purpose: to educate the public about how science works, and how, often, it doesn't.  In particular, the section of three essays gathered under the heading &quot;Numbers and Probability&quot; is very good at making one think about the real nature of &quot;the odds.&quot
