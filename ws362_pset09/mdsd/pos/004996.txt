While I will claim this book an important step towards demystifying the misinformed and injurious attitudes towards the &quot;adult entertainment&quot; industry, I say it with some reservation.  O'Toole is  very thorough (and amazingly convincing) in his examination and rebuttal of  many of the unfair accusations against pornography.  However, O'Toole's  careful omissions of many of the tragic events in the porn world forced me  to be a bit skeptical about his reportage. Nonetheless, I think this is an  important text and a good read.  O'Toole's defense is refreshing and, many  times, enlightening, although I think his arguments are weakened by his  unflinching one-sidedness  (he asserts that &quot;snuff&quot; films don't  exist and adult films aren't &quot;obsence&quot;, yet he fails to report on  &quot;Bizarro-Sleaze&quot; films of Robert Black and Gregory Dark--see  &quot;Neither Adult Nor Entertainment&quot; by Willem R. Degroot and Matt  Rundlet in Premiere, Sept. 1998). To conclude, I would suggest this text to  anyone interested by the adult industries, but would suggest that the  reader not be so credulous to accept all that O'Toole says without first  checking up on his claims.  In other words, O'Toole's Pornocopia would be a  better work if he would have presented EVERYTHING and allowed the reader to  come to his own conclusions about the porn-world.  By leaving things out,  it appears that O'Toole isn't confident that his championing of porn will  be accepted and, subsequently an important trust can't be forged
