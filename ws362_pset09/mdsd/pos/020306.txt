I bought this book a few weeks ago while searching through the IT books section. Being in the IT Security field for over 7 years and remembering some of my earlier days, I decided to buy it. Overall I liked how Ms. Harris broke out the ethics and laws. Most of us in the field know there are laws, but never take the time to sit down and absorb them. The coding stuff was the best and more up my alley. I've seen too many security professionals who don't know how to code and coding IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL YOU CAN LEARN. This book cleanly broke down C, Assembley, and some sample exploits really well. I was able to brush up on my Assembley and learn some cool tools in the process. If you've read Hacking Exposed and want some more fundamental information, read this book. You'll really like it.
