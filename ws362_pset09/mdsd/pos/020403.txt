However, if you're looking for a book full of knowledge (such as a theory that once a creative person exhausts they're creativity they perish) anchectdotes that bring the life of a writer to your eyes, and if you're looking for advice on writing (includeding a little deep how to) Then this is your book. The only problems are that the title is misleading and the author does seem to have a condisending, belittling tone that may make him sound like he's brag while realating some of his stories. It's still well worth a read
