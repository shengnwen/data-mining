One of the best U2 books I've ever read, mostly because it allows for a first person perspective from Bono. Michka generally divides each conversation into a single chapter (although this is not true for the first 4 chapters), so the chapters go by easily, and the titles are quite funny overall. Bono meanders his way through subjects like death, spirituality, Africa, what it means to be a rock star, and love. I already loved Bono immensely before reading this book, and now I think I have arrived at a new level of admiration and respect for the man. So many sections of this book are quotable; Bono has great opinions on all sorts of things, yet he's funny, self-deprecating, and extremely intelligent. Michka, to be honest, annoyed me after awhile. Some of his questions were either too broad, or just too simple.  For somebody who's considered Bono as a friend since 1980, I felt like I knew more about Bono's life in some areas than Michka did, and I've only been a U2 fan for about four years. Still, the book is excellent, especially when Bono wanders off into reflections on his personal relationship with God, for example. Definitely a must-read for any U2 fan.
