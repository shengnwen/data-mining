I'm a new Terri Blackstock fan, but she has me hooked now!  I love the way she manages to get the message of Christ into each book.  And the suspense in this kept me on the edge of my chair.  I like to read anyway, but I literally could not put this one down until I had finished it.  I hope she writes more Newpointe 911 novels!

This novel focuses on the firemen in Newpointe and their wives.  First one wife is murdered--and then another!  It soon becomes obvious that a killer is stalking the firemen's wives.  Mark Branning is determined to keep his wife safe, but that is difficult to do because she kicked him out of the house for a suspected affair.  But they each love the other, and they are Christians, so they reach out to God for help.  And we know that the Holy Spirit is always there with us, regardless of what happens.  It is definitely an exciting and fulfilling read
