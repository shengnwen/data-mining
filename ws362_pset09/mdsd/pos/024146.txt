This is one of the most informative books on the Eighth Air Force's role in WWII.  The author's research for this book is made into a tight book with the addition of the comments and diary entries from the men that where there.  It's hard for me to understand what these men(boys really) went through during this time frame.  To face the odds that they faced and to do it time and again is a true sign of the courage that was shown during WWII.   I was thoroughly engrossed in the action and I could feel the rumbling of the 4 engines as I read along.  This is a must read for anyone interested in history particularly World War II and aviation history
