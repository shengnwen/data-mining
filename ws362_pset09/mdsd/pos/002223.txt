I found this book to be immensely helpful in explaining the details of training for a mountain bike.  I especially liked the explanation of training for aerobic and anaerobic fitness and intensity.  I also found the guidance for developing an annual plan to be excellent.  I recommend this book for any experienced and/or serious cyclist that wants to raise their fitness either for recreation riding or racing to a new level
