Rose and her family are still living in the little town of Mansfield.  There, they are doing the best they can to get back on their feet and return to Rocky Ridge Farm.  It's a big year for Rose and filled with many changes.  For example, she witnesses the dawn of a new era as she  celebrates the turn of the new century.  Besides all the hard work, there's  still love in the air for Rose! &quot;New Dawn on Rocky Ridge continues the  story that Laura Ingalls Wilder told of her own childhood, a story that has  charmed generations of readers, including me.&quot
