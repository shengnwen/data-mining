Overall, the book is good and gives access to information and pictures you cannot find anywhere else. However, I expected more pictures and less text. Pity that some of sitcoms mentioned were not illustrated at all. I bought this book specifically to get decent pictures of Frasier's filming set but was disappointed - the set is so fabulous it almost deserves a separate book on itself, and all it got was a couple of less than perfect photos.
