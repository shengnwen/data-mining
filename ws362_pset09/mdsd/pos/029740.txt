I'm not much of a "Western" reader.   But, this was Zane Grey's first book so I thought I'd give it a try.  It turned out to be an interesting story.  I "read" it as a book on tape.  The reader of the book on tape was able to change his voice for each character so the result was like a "radio play".  Very enjoyable!
