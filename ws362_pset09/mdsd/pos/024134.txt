As an owner of the second and third editions, I found the second edition's physical qualities (paper, printing quality, etc.) to be better than the third edition's. Mr. Messina is mistaken when he indicates that my previous review was based on the second edition. I had ordered (through Amazon) the book on a waiting list and got it shortly after it was published. It is sitting next to me as I type. The second edition is in my office
