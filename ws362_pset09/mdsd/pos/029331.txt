Yes, this is a history book, but what a history book! It not only deals with what happened in the Civil War but the pre-Civil War history that led to the catastrophe. Mcpherson is a master writer because making history this facinating is a difficult task. Reading this book will draw  you in like the History Channel on TV but instead of skimming the subject will submerse you in so deep you will fully understand the dynamics of our country's shakey and fragile beginnings that made the Civil War almost inevitable! It is detailed but in no way boring. Mcpherson paints a vivid and complete picture of our nation in that era
