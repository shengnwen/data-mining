The Monsters Ring by Bruce Coville is a great book and I would recommend it but only for people 15 and younger. The story starts on a street. Russle is talking to Eddie on his way out of school talking to him and is saying that he is going to go to the magic shop. Russle is walking and he see's a magic shop. He walks in and is looking around and sees a ring.  He picks it up and goes and shows it to his friend. Then they go to school. After school he drops the ring and it goes down the sewer.

Russel is really protective about the ring he gets in the magic shop. He is really protective of the ring for an example he does not let any body else touch it but himself. He has like a monster inside him because he is really nice but when he is mad he hurts someone. He hurt Eddie his best friend because he bumped in to him and his ring fell down the sewer. He is really selfish because he does not let any body else touch his ring He has brown hair and brown eyes.
