I bought this for my niece as I have now discovered that knitting is THE thing girls are doing today. Very colorful, easy to read layout and super cute projects. She is already planning the chinese themed knit party with her friends, and I'm sure she can't wait to put those text messaging mittens to use once she gets her own cell phone
