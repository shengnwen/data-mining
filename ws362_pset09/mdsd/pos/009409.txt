The play Mrs. Warren's Profession was good, the main charcter was not Mrs. Warren but her daughter Vivie who goes back in and forth in every act between love and hate for her mother who has been a prostitue and ran some brothels. Vivie is convienced her mother could have made a better choice for herself than prostitution. Mrs. Warren has kept Vivie out of the brothels all of her life and gave her the best in education and up bring. But even though she has done all of that Vivie is not content on being there any longer with her mother. End the end Vivie leaves her mother and Mrs. Warren holds her self together unappoligic for anything she has done. This play was a great example of how women had two choices at the time the play was set in marriage or prostitution which were both forms of slavery. Shaw knew how hard it was for women in society and wanted more for them, than just mother hood and marriage
