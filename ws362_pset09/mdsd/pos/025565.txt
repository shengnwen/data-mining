A fascinating and educational little book.   It begins with the basics of a guiding philosophy, then a relatively detailed description of 3 types of triggers, followed by descriptions of several interesting traps.   Ample detail is given in the text and the illustrations are helpful.   I would have liked more step-by-step illustrations in some cases to clarify some points but still they were sufficient.   The writing is at an appropriate level and complexity for instructional text and was very readable.  The size of the book makes it easy to slip in a pocket and take with you as a ready field guide when you want to give some of these a try.   The tools you will need are quite simple and you could easily get along with a knife, saw, and a hammer alone to make all the traps in this book.   It is an interesting anthropological study of human ingenuity in itself.
