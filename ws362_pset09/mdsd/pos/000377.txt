This book is great ! Really !  I pratice OO development especially following RUP. This book describe a full Usability process, with activities, guidelines, workload estimation and artifacts. You can directly  put it at work, because you naturally see why an activity leads to another.  All the book is good, even if it seems heavy (500+ pp), there is no waste  of space. As a RUP practitioner, it's very easy to integrate this approach  into the RUP and it naturally fits with Use Cases. Believe me: get it
