Edward Said is famous for being a Palestinian and being a leading polemist on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Visciously anti-Israel he has caused many scnadals and was a renowned thinker.  His memoir, written when he was sick, is insightful a true tale of what the Palestinian Arab elite looked like on the eve of the 1948 war.  Said was born in Jerusalem, according to him, and was raised in Egypt, with a nanny and drivers, his father was American and had served in WWI, both his families came from Baptist protestant and Anglican backgrounds.  His father made good money in Egypt in a stationary business, employing many of the diverse people that lived there then, including Armenians, Greeks, Copts and Jews.  Today that community isd gone, as is the elite neigborhood where Said grew up and the private schools he attended.  Said was in Jerusalem in Talbieh during 1948.  He recalls the war and its aftermath. He also writes about Lebanon, about the village where he stayed there and travelling in the Middle East as a young boy.  His was a life of luxury, a life that was 'destroyed' by 1948.  His uncle was murdered by the Egyptian police for being a communist.  His parents didnt talk politics, he makes up for that.

An interesting work, helpful for anyone interested in what the Palestinian Arab elite looked like in the 1930s.
