Howards End is set in the tradition of the great British novel. Although Forster tackles less politically and morally charged themes here than he does with A Passage to India, Howards End certainly has more heart--naturally, since it tackles the soul.

There is also a secondary theme of the approaching women's lib movement, always in the background, but always threatening the men in the novel, especially Henry Wilcox and his brood. Margaret Schlegel is the sort of woman who would be at the forefront on the movement today, but she doesn't know it. Her intelligence and passion for people and creation are inhibited by an early resignation to Old Maidhood--that is, until she falls in love with Mr. Wilcox, the husband of Margaret's late, unlikely mate.

Practical and dispassionate, Wilcox is "the sort of man who made Britain" what it is (one of Forster's pet phrases), yet an emotionally insipid and incompetent patriarch. He is exactly the sort of man women are fighting even today--he doesn't understand women; he doesn't even understand men, except in business.

Stalking these very different sides of the British upper middle-class throughout the story is Leonard Bast, a poor clerk with a spark of the greatness the Schlegels value, who hides his authentic humanity behind affectations of culture. Helen's, Margaret's sister's, attempts at patronage are a rather overt stab at wealthy liberal condescension toward the underclass, applicable to limousine libs today.

Receding into the past but never forgotten, is the will from Mrs. Wilcox bequeathing Howards End to Margaret--a mystical and unfulfilled last will and testament that haunts  the Wilcoxes for failure to comply with the lady's wishestill the end
