An excellent book. Done in black and white. All illustrations are hand drawn diagrams and sketches. Complete coverage of the subject in great detail.  Uses the degree of angle in most folds.  Good for a math. inclined  user. Mark Hiner's &quot;Paper Engineering For Pop-up Books and Cards&quot;  covers all the basics and provides models to paste in the book-better than  a lot of detail.  Jackson's &quot;The Pop-up Book&quot; gives good  directions and inspirational colored photos of designs made by art students  and professionals.     Duncan's book is good for step-by-step instruction  with numbered angles and &quot;paste flap A to flap D etc.     I would  recommend Hiner's &quot;Paper Engineering&quot; over this book
