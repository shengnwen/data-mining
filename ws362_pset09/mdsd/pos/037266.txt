I have been writing Japanese for years, and I started with the author's &quot;Let's Learn Hiragana&quot; and &quot;Let's Learn Katakana.&quot;  I loved both books, especially the Hiragana.  I learned Kanji from various sources, spent hundreds of dollars on books (literally), yet none of them were as beautifully written as this one.  If you want to learn the characters in depth, and want to really enjoy writing them (yes, it is artistic and even fun to do) and not just be flabbergasted and frustrated, this is the book to start with (or even switch over to).  I might get this book just to improve my handwriting
