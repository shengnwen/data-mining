Take notice of the dedication page please. This is, IMO, a Hardy Boy's In Space 'young adult' adventure. It should have been labled such by the publisher. I wonder if they were trying to suck in Liaden fans. If so, it may backfire on Sharon and Steve by causing new readers to think the Liaden books are similar.

I've read all of their Liaden books, starting in 1988 with Conflict of Honors, one of the best.  Take it from me, the Liaden books are in a class of their own. An exalted class
