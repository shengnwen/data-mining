The general format of the Dillman books are introduction to pressure points, applications, and comparison of application of the Dillman system to karate.  The books are primarily pictorial and have relatively little verbiage.

As a practicioner of Shorin Ryu and Small Circle Jujitsu, the Dillman system (based on Dillman books' contents) appears to be a fusion (with slight tweaks) of Okinawan Shorin Ryu Karate and Small Circle Jujitsu. Further investigation indicated that Mr. Dillman studied under a Shorin Ryu Grandmaster and studied with Small Circle Jujitsu Grandmaster and founder Wally Jay.

I gave this book and other Dillman books four stars (I did not write reviews for all the Dillman books based on time constraints) for the following: eventhough I think these books make good introductory and refresher/reference books, they failed to incorporate and emphasize falling and landing techniques.  I recommend the Small Circle Jujitsu video series and Shorin Ryu instruction for those seeking additional knowledge.  One should also consider "Dim Mak" or pressure point strikes as additional reference
