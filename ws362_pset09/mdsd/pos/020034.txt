This book takes a little bit of your soul after you are finished reading it.  It's that depressing.  The weird thing is, it's very compelling; it's the literary equivalent of rubbernecking at a horrific 5-car pileup.  You want to look away, but you just can't.  Still, it's definitely not a happy book, but I ultimately liked it.

The writing style and character development may turn a lot of people off.  The sentences are very long, held together with very many "and's."  It gives the narrative a monotonous tone, but this adds to the sense of detachment and unfeeling that is the book's theme.  As for character development, there is none.  Clay and the others remain just as coked-out and vapid and unhappy at the end as in the beginning.  Again, this adds to the book's theme instead of detracting from it.  All in all, not a book for everyone.  For those willing, though, they will find a short, depressing, but intriguing novel
