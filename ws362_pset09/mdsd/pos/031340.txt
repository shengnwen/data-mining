This book is great for the experienced cook who's fairly new to pressure cooking. 

I love to cook and use lots of different cooking equipment, but the pressure cooker was a little bit intimidating at first, I guess because of the stories you hear about the old ones blowing up. The new pressure cookers have many safety features that eliminate the need for concern.

Every recipe that I tried turned out beautifully.  The directions were clear and concise, and there were many varied and unusual choices. I have 3 of Lorna Sass' pressure cooking books and love them all.

For anyone who wants to make great and interesting food fast, this is a must have
