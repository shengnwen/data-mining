I do enjoy history about this period in Italy if it's not too dry.  This certainly met the bill.  It's so entertaining to get a book of history that reads like fiction.  I kept having to remind myself that this was, in fact, history.  

Mr. King manages to bring to life the characters of the Pope, Michelangelo, and all his contemporaries in an entertaining and information way.

My only complaint with the book was that the color plates did not include many of the features of the ceiling that were discussed at length and although some of the other art work discussed in the book were illustrated, some were not.  I kept having to go find examples on the internet to look at while I was reading.

My star ratings: 

One star - couldn't finish the book 

Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the author 

Three stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually. 

Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author. 

Five stars - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author.
