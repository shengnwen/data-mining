Im a huge fan of the previous dirty pair comics and this one is close to perfection.  Some fans may not like Kei and Yuri having lips now, it takes a second to adjust. But to be honest Kei and Yuri have never looked better.  The coloring is the best I've seen in a comic book-EVER.  And Adam Warren is as incredibly clever as ever.  His writting istyle is top notch, and the humor blends with the story brilliantly.  My only complaint, and its a tiny one; is that there isnt as much action as before.  While I dont need mecha exploding and body parts a-flyin' at every page, this graphic novel is a little more tame than the last 3.  I recomend this graphic novel to any &quot;lovely angels&quot; fan(Kyotaku...if yer a fan u get it) all anime/manga fans and even casual comic book collector/readers. It is worth it
