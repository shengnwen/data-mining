Perhaps joining two characters he knows very, very well (Sunny and Stone) invigorated the author. For this is one of the most enjoyable Parker books I've read in a while. Almost all the characters are believable, multi-dimensional and (regardless of how we may feel about them initially) sympathetic at one point or another. Watching Sunny and Jesse drift toward a relationship is involving. And -- wonder of wonders -- when Susan Silverman appears, we not only don't want to kill her, we actually appreciate her insights! 

This book is a character study. It's about dialog and nuance and atmosphere. The murder mystery itself is not that compelling. And the plot has more than a couple major holes in it. (Most notably, as one of the highlighted reviewers mentioned, in these post-Pete Rose/Balco days, there's no way a thug like Buddy could buy a major league team; and there's no way that a baseball fan like Parker doesn't know that.) 

So it's a four-star, not a five-star. And really, so what? It's a fun read and it gives us an illuminating look at characters we have come to care about
