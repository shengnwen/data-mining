A Woman of Substance is one of the best books that I have ever read in my eighteen years of living. The book's heroine, Emma Harte, inspired me in ways both big and small. 

Emma Harte came from miserable circumstances. As a child, Emma grew up in abject poverty, and she had to toil for the demeaning Fairleys just to support herself and her family. However, through working for the Fairleys at a young age, she learned the value of hard work and determination in achieving one's goals. Impregnated and abandoned by Edwin Fairley before the age of 20, Emma's situation seemed only to worsen.

However, Emma refused to become victimized by her adversities. She refused to let the Fairleys or her poverty ruin her or her dreams. Her work ethic and strength of character enabled her to gloriously triumph over her circumstances. Towards the end of the book, she becomes one of the richest, most powerful women in the world.

Watching Emma's inspirational triumph over adversity has motivated me to never let any obstacles get in the way of my dreams. The book's principles of perserverance and hard work have now become guiding principles in my life. I am grateful that I read this book because I learned many other powerful lessons about life and endurance through Emma.

Emma Harte is an amazing woman. She is a remarkable force. She is a woman of substance
