Maniac Magee is about a  12 year old boy whose parents where killed in a car crash at the age of three.  He was sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle that really do not like each other to the point they have 2 of everything.  They argued all the time, one night at his play they started yelling at each other so he decided to run away.  

Maniac Magee ran away to a a town called Two Mills that was divided by race.  The white people lived on the east side and the black families lived on the west side.  This is where he meets a black girl Amanda. One day she had a bag full of books and Maniac asked her for one book to read.  When he returned the book Amanda's family they found out that he had no where to live so the Bealle family invited him to stay with them.  He ran away from there because of the racial comments and situations the Bealle family had to hear.  The Bealle family treid to help convince him that you should not always run away you should face situations.

Maniac Magee faced problems his whole life.  Ms. Bealle suggested to him to go and try to untie a knot that no one else has been able to untie.  When he did people started seeing him as a person and not a white kid.

When Maniac Magee runs away from the Bealle family he finds a white family to live with that has no rules and are very unstable.  He stays there to help the two younger boys to understand how important it is to stay in school.  Maniac Magee continued going back and forth to the east and then to the west side over and over.

This book shows us how racism is in our world to a point.  It is hard to seperate people from who they are instead of what they appear to be.  Maniac Magee over came the racism issues in Two Mills by seeing how each family of two different colors have issues and they are more alike then what they think.  I would recommend this book to all my friends.
