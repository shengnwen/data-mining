After I recently read After Life, I am immensely moved by the last chapter Papa, Can You Hear Me?.  It must have taken John a lot of courage to open up and tell a true story about himself and his father.  

John frankly stated that it was hard to mend the relationship.  For some people, they probably would cover things up and just colorfully paint the difficult relationship:  After all, their fathers are dead, and nobody can refute with them.  Instead, John chooses to honestly recount the relationship.  The readers therefore can see his struggle as well as his father's.

Then we can also read John's interpretation of the good-bye from his father.  We can understand that so far the way he handled the issue is the best he can do under his own frustration.  He does not dwell on the past, and he does not dream about something useless.

Apparently becoming a father changed John's view on life, because in the book I see the humble wisdom replacing the young cockiness.  In this book John grew into a humble father who had experienced the toughest struggle.  Now he rises as a true phoenix after bravely consuming the old him.  John displays real confidence thanks to the self-examination rather than naïve blindness.

I appreciate his growth.
