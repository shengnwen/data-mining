This book gives you a blow-by-blow account of how a piano is made at the Steinway factory in New York City.  The book is readable and gives you an appreciation of the detail and precision, all of the handiwork that go into a well-crafted piano.  It also shows that a piano is not just a standard item  -- pianos are crafted for individuals (Horowitz likes a light, responsive touch, Rubenstein wanted a more resistant touch, some performers want different tones depending on what they are playing).  The only drawback (unless you're a Steinway groupie) -- it's rather self-promotional, a well-written, well-illustrated 143-page Steinway &amp; Sons advertisement, but fascinating nonetheless
