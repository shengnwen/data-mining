The Cambridge Music Handbooks try to do what is rarely done-- bridge the gap between the dilettante &quot;light&quot; style of books on music that are written for the &quot;general public&quot; the esoteric style of heavy musicological writing. A noble pursuit, but one that runs the risk of pleasing no one rather than achieving a happy medium. Having read several of the Cambridge Music Handbooks, this one stands out as being one of the more successful. I especially enjoyed the discussion of the history of the forms which the Rhapsody in Blue has appeared (&quot;jazzy&quot; versions versus &quot;classical&quot; renditions), as well as the background of the work's first performance in Aeolian Hall in 1924. At times, the book tends towards the more &quot;musicological&quot; style, but all in all, it remains accessible and interesting to anyone interested in music. Schiff's style throughout is engaging and witty. If this is a piece of music you are looking to explore further, I highly recommend this book
