At first, I had a love hate relationship with this book. I sensed that everything in it was true, yet I wasn't ready to face it.  Once I got past my denial, I began using it as a reference book for all of my relationships.

THE GIVERS & THE TAKERS in not just about boyfriend and girlfriend issues.  The information is relevant for any relationship: mother/daughter, friends and co-workers.  A great read.

When I'm troubled over relationship issues, I can usually find some insightful piece of wisdom that reminds me that I'm giving too much to someone. And, I learned that Takers exist because Givers focus more on other people than on themselves
