I ordered several copies of this book for my mothers' group to use during our summer session.The book has been great to get us talking about both what we need to do and what we want to do for ourselves. Some members are working on more practical badges, like organization, while others are working on beading, knitting etc.--and all of us are giving ourselves credit for hard things we've already accomplished but not thoroughly acknowledged, like childbirth and potty training kids! 

We were surprised at some topics that were missing--scrapbooking isn't in there, for example--but this was a minor drawback
