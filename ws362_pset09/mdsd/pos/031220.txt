For the intermediate to advanced horseplayer looking for a good synthesis of ideas on successful handicapping, this book is a must read! Of all the handicapping books I've read, this one has by far the greatest depth and clearest organization. Each of the numerous chapters is dedicated to a single concept, all of which are well thought out and do not conform to a single &quot;system&quot; (which is the case with more than a few handicapping books). I fully recommend this book to any horseplayer
