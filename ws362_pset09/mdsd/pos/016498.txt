This gay romance between a handyman and his mailman is a delightful read. It is a heartwarming love story set in a backward small town.
Ed and Rick are just your ordinary guys living very ordinary lives. Being gay has not been easy for either of them, not when they wish to find the permanent love of their lives. 
How they met, the development of their relationship and finally finding the courage to live together in a possibly homophobic small town is told with a hearfelt warmth which has me rooting for the couple.  
The story is also sprinkled with comical moments, provided by  Ed's mother who is a quirky but endearing character.
The charm of the story is the ordinariness of the atmosphere and its people and it is good to have parents who support their gay sons.
This writer definitely has a flair and I look forward to the continuation of the handyman's love story and his dream
