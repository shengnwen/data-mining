A.W. Tozer is someone who knew God very personally and he leaves
us a very intimate account of his relationship with God in this
book.  This is one of the 5 most influential books I have ever
read as a Christian.  I believe this book should be on everyone's reading list if they desire to know more about God
and how they can know Him better.  Dr. Tozer's books still tell the deep spiritual truths that all believers need to have a closer walk with God.  Most highly recommended
