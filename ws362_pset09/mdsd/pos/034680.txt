As usual, Mr. Frank is good at spotting some issues. However, he misses the mark with the cause. People have lost the bright line distinction between a free market and mercantilism. When the government fosters certain larger endeavors at the expense of mom and pop stores it is NOT capitalism. We have government paying for new stadiums for billion dollar sports clubs. We have government finding excuses to take the property away from small stores to give it to chain stores. Chain stores are given taxpayer backed incentives to move into towns by local politicans who get campaign contributions. When corporations are allowed to easily file bankruptcy on 100s of millions of dollars of debt but we crack down on consumer bankruptcy and eliminate it entirely for student loans, it is clearly the disparity in treatment under the law that is the problem. On and on, the law is benefitting the enormous businesses at the expense of competition with the smaller endeavors and private consumer. These things are the antithesis of a free market, yet both parties practice it regularly, eagerly, and unpatriotically
