I heard Vince Poscente - The Speaker - address a huge audience last year and he was the most captivating speaker I've ever seen.  When I heard about his new book, I purchased it immediately.  This book is the most straightforward motivational book there is PERIOD.  Vince clearly explains, by using a clever metaphor, the vast untapped potential that each of us has buried in our subconscious minds.  Once understood, he shows you how to use this potential to achieve more results in all aspects of your life. I liked it so much that I bought a copy for each of my employees
