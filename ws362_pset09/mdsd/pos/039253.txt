Well here it is 4,000,000,000 years crammed into 365 pages and a full index. Bet you thought no one could do it? Of course no one can do it! But Fortey comes as close as is possible and tells it like a master wordsmith. Each chapter deals with a different geological epoch: from the earliest slime molds generating all that 02 neccessary for further plant evolution to the eventual marvels of dinosaurs and modern man. 

There are high points and low points in Fortey's writing. His experiences on Spitzbergen are a little drawn out and he also sometimes carries on analogies more than they should (reference the monkey's tea party). But beyond that, Fortey is as close as one can get to a literate Richard Dawkins -- and certainly a lot friendlier with few axes to grind. 

The high points of the book will change from person to person, but for me it was the descriptions of all those slime molds eeking out an existence in an adverse world. All of the evolution they made possible, while at the same time not really evolving. The analysis of biosphere in the inner reaches of the earth were also focused and great to read. The passage to bony creatures from external skeletons and analysis of the wonderful Burgess Shales rendering more questions raised than answered. But the crowning glory in my estimation was the genesis of the KT climax rendering dinosaurs exctinct in most cases and leading to the rise of mammals... 

In final analysis there are few people that can write well enough to pass natural history off with as much verve and adventure as Richard Fortey. That is a standing tribute to the beauty of this book and should be recommended reading to any adolescent, or adult with a penchant for understanding nature and the greater glory of God and the wonder of the world around us!
