Every once in a while I yearn for a story that touches the heart and the mind.  This is one of those stories. 

I learned a lot about quail and their habits; I enoyed reading the book.   It's a story I won't forget.  A wonderful story for young people and old and the in between.

The way Stanger describes Robert's little habits and quirks are enchanting.  I fell in love with the little bird and can easily understand why he created such a stir during his life time
