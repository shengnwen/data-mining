I love Butcher's take on werewolves in this second book in his series.  As if Dresden doesn't have enough trouble trying to help track a serial killer for his friend at the Special Investigation branch of the CPD, he has to cope with the involvment of several groups/gangs of werewolves along the way.

Again, Harry Dresden blunders his way into a situation that he feels that he must cope with, wizard that he is, but is way over his expectations.  And, of course, things are not what they seem.  But with the help of some silver bullets and his own wizardly knowlege, well, people still get badly hurt.  This is no "G" rated series where people just get knocked over after all.

I have to say that I love how consistant the "special effects" are in this series.  And I love the characters and the way they interact.  Dresden may be blind to the obvious at times, and mess up regularly, but that just makes him human like the rest of us
