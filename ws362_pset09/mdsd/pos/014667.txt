This is one of several Hemingway books I have come to read, actually in this case, listen to. 
I loathe idling about so I decided while I wait, wherever that maybe, I would listen to an audiobook. I prefer the unabridged versions which in this case was quite long.

I found the subject matter mysteriously complex ( who doesn't find love  complex ) yet simplistic in it's exposition true to Hemingway's style.

Each character is carefully developed and his/her relationships meticulously crafted and consistent with their dispositions.

Hemingway explores humanity and allows us a glimpse of it in the most trying circumstances....love and war.
It really is very hard to discuss the book without ruining details and the outcome so I will stop here.

I would suggest getting the audicopy on ipod and listening to it on your next long journey overseas
