I picked this book up because of writer Paul Theroux's praise of Naipaul's writing, though the impression I had of Naipaul, as a person, was dry and stuffy and rude. But this book has none of that flavor, and instead has a lot of humor. It's written in a clean and crisp style, and the dialogue is perfectly placed and sometimes hilarious. It's a collection of stories, but they all take place in the same area, sometimes with the same characters wandering in and out. So it's not really a normal collection of &quot;short stories.&quot; But still, I can't heap praise on everything Naipaul has written. His &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; is highly regarded, but I couldn't tolerate the boring and stiff writing in that book
