This was the first time I bought a travel book from Lonely Planet.  I loved it because it provides a historical as well as a modern background on the cities being visited.  The recommendations for dinner, site-seeting, etc were great!  The only thing I would've added is a rating of the top sites to see if you are only in the city for a short time.
