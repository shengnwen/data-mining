This book helped me come up to speed in Exchange Server 2003 when I got sort of thrown into supporting it at work. It sounds like that last reviewr didn't get past the intro material. The first part of this book is all about architecture and planning. It was kind of dry and a bit more than I was ready for just learning about Exchange. But, starting with chapter 7, the book is all action. It takes you through installing, setting up recipients, storage groups, routing groups, administrative groups, and everything you need to know to get a server up and going. It has a great section on security. I get asked a lot of questions about that at work. It even talks about disaster recovery and performance tuning. The writings pretty easy to follow. They use lots of supporting pictures and step by step explanations. I just skipped the first 6 chapters and plan to come back to them after I've been using it a while
