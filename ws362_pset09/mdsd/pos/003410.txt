This book is a magnificent work filled with easily executed exercises to demonstrate diversity and social justice practices. If you are needing a training exercise, an exploration of a topic such as gender or race, or possibly an activity for a classroom or business diversity training  - this is your one stop shopping resource! 

It also offers many practical examples of quizzes, activities and other items that can be used for whatever issue you want to talk about. The references and extensive resource list provide for further work in areas of race, gender, ability and other subjects on diversity. There are even suggested curriculum formats provided in the appendix. 

I cannot say enough about the usefulness of this book, the ease of using it for all levels of knowledge and the variety of ways it can be used for diversity education.
