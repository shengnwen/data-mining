I am a big fan of Smith's River God, Seventh Scroll, and Warlock.
The Seventh Scroll is the sequel to River God, and deals with modern day historian/archeologists who discover scrolls written by our hero Taita, who was a beloved friend/advisor of Queen Lostris in ancient Egypt. 
Deciphering Taita's code brings us firmly back to Taita's world and wit and cunning - The modern characters stand up to the ancient characters, and as all Smith works, leaves you wanting for more.
The next sequel in this series is Warlock. Hopefully there will be more novels with Taita..
