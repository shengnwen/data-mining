In 2000, Chalmers Johnson published _Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire_. Then on September 11, 2001, the United States was attacked by Islamist terrorists. This was a spectacular example of blowback. So Johnson's _Blowback_ stands as a prophetic forewarning that the American empire of military bases around the world will probably give rise to more and more blowback against Americans.

In _The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic_, Chalmers Johnson now deepens his prophetic role by cautioning us Americans about the out of control militarism and our often foolhardy foreign policy. _The Sorrows of Empire_ is lengthier than _Blowback_ and even more unsettling to read, even if you have already read numerous other critiques of American foreign policy
