This is a great resource book for beginning and intermediate costume jewelry collecters. Excellent synopses of many of the great jewelry designers and manufacturers.  Lists some of the identifying characteristics and values of some of the 1940's and 1950's designer jewelry that will help to classify unsigned pieces from this era.  Beautiful photographs of a multitude of jewelry pieces from various designers.  The only fault I found with this book is one that Mrs. Carroll states herself; there are few photos of very early costume jewelry pieces.  She advises the readers to review older books on costume jewelry to get more complete information on early jewelry
