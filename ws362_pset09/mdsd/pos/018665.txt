One close look inside this book and you will quicky see that it was written for the Dungeon Master. This does not detract from it's sincere reading enjoyment for everyone. I find the prestige classes offered to be interesting, but mainly for NPC's, the true necromancer was a big disappointment, and has no where near the flavor of the Dread Necromancer presented in Hero's of Horror. Great art thought. I contrary to others am interested in detailed descriptions of the Undead, such as eating habits, this can really enhance the role playing of such creatures, and deepen plotlines. As a PC, you can make good use of some of the items presented here, whether you are a Cleric of Nerull or a Paladin or Pelor. Will you use this whole book in its entirity? probably not, but you will probably use some of it. If you use a lot of undead in your campaign, then this book is dead on for you
