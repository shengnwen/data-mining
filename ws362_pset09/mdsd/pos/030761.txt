I'm not a scholar or a student of history like some of the reviewers are. Basically, I picked this book because I work with Hekate and I heard that it has some good content. The personal accounts hit home with me because they matched a lot of what I have been through and even though I've read and re-read The Charge of Hecate several times since I've bought Crossroads, still makes my throat tighten and sends a shiver up my spine. All in all Crossroads is a good book for anyone who is interested in Hekate with some things in it that I haven't found anywhere else
