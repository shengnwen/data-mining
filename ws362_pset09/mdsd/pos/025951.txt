'Shadow of the Sentinel' weaves together post civil war Knights of the Golden Circle conspiracies with modern day treasure hunting. It also offers up the idea that Jesse James faked his death and lived to be over a hundred as J. Frank Dalton. The book contends he helped the KGC rob and stash loot for the revival of the southern cause. On the trail of hidden treasure co-author Bob Brewer recounts his adventures solving codes, ciphers, and staying clear of modern guards and weary property owners all while finding small caches of buried coins. He was also tricked by a treasure hunting partner and beaten to the biggest stash of all! It really is just an armchair adventure though so don't read this book looking for clues to buried hoards.
