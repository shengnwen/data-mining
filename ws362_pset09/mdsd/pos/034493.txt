I gave this book four stars, but almost gave it five. Four and a half stars would probably be what I'd say it deserves.

Like in the two previous books, there is adventure, character development, and occasional humor. But it didn't quite drive me like the first two did. 

The first time I read this book, I would not have considered five stars at all, it would have had three or four. I re-read it, however, and I liked it better after I did (perhaps because when re-reading I can skip over the least interesting parts, but I did not do a whole lot of skipping.) 

The journey across the desert was interesting, but didn't interest me enough. The long wait in Istanbul was almost as frustrating for me as for the characters. The worst was the section promised by the title, near the end of the journey, when Laurence and Temeraire join the Prussians in their war against the French--again, almost as frustrating and depressing for me as for the characters.(I suppose this could be a good writing technique to get you to connect with the caracters, lol ;) After that, however, it does improve, (*small spoiler*) with the hatching of Iskierka, who had me laughing out loud over and over at her antics. 

If you read and liked the first two books in the series, give this one a try, it is very good, and promises of better things to come.
