"Deep, profound, complicated and eventually simple, like all truths....", someone said.
Forget it! The views offered by D.K. and A.B. are awesome.
They offer depths within depths, within depths.
No simplicity here! Headache guaranteed.
No person can ever hope to fully understand.

If you are into New Age, please skip this book.

But if this is the quality Mrs. Bailey and D.K. offer, their books will find their way to my bookshelf!
