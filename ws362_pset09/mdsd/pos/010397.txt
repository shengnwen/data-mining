I picked this book up with no expectations at all.  It ended up being the main book we have used all year to learn the alphabet. It's so great!!! The best thing about this book is that the alphabet runs down the side of each page so when you are on the "E" page for example you have the whole alphabet listed down the side of the page with E highlighted.  I taught my daughter to run her fingers down the side going "A, B, C , D " etc. etc. as she had memorized the alphabet song.  If she did this carefully then she would get to the highlighted letter and know what it was by using the song.  This way she could read the book herself, turn to any page and find out what the letter was on her own.  This helped her very much with recognizing the letters.  We literally used this book several times a week as her main preschool book (we homeschool).  I highly recommend it.  You can't go wrong for the price!
