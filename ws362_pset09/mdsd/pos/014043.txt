I just passed the 70-282 test today. The Small Business Specialist Primer was very well written, covers (although not in much depth) all the bases needed to pass the exam. To be fair, I also had a copy of Harry's 2nd Edition Small Business Server Best Practices book as well. I would give the book 5 stars if I was absolutely sure I could pass the exam with this book alone
