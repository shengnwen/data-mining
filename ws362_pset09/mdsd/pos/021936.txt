In many ways this is a brilliant work.  It's difficult to review now since our tastes have changed and since part of its value was in its originality -- which has been built upon by more modern authors.  Thus, it is a true classic.  One's valuation of it has much to do with whether one evaluates it in the context of the 19th century or the 21st.  Collins subtly criticizes much of 19th century English society in his treatment of Ezra, Clack, Mrs. Merridew, etc.  Even Betteredge's reliance on "Robinson Crusoe" seems to reflect on Victorian religious mores (i.e. perhaps (?)  an allusion to the Bible).  Differences in social mores today can be seen in both Rachel's & Rosanna's coverups etc.   The basic structure of the book--a series of eyewitness accounts reminds one of certain TV shows & the normal operation of our police or CSIs--where evidence is uncovered bit by bit though interviews & re-interviews.  Today's mysteries rely on yesterday's just as today's sitcoms rely on Shakespeare's comedies.  Collins appears to succeed overall in well-defining his characters and their styles along with their assumptions, prejudices, etc.  However, as Collins states in his Author's Preface, "The attempt made here, is to trace the influence of character on circumstances" vs. its opposite per most other novels.  This is a lengthy & enjoyable (though at times a bit tedious & wordy) novel--not really escape fiction as with many of the pseudo mysteries of today (more suspense story than legitimate mystery with clues etc. that are fair to the reader).  Its values are much deeper.  It may not become your favorite, but it's well worth discovering
