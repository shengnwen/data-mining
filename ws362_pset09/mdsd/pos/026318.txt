So I pick up this book (it was a gift from friends), and expect it to be dull and dry like Tacitus or Plutarch.  Instead, Caeser has me rolling (well, not exactly) with laughter.  He writes in a very historically accurate way, but since this is a piece of propaganda, he tends to lay the blame for mistakes on someone else, or rationalize his breaks from the Roman authority.  Caeser also belittles the natives of most of Gaul (except the Belgae, &quot;the most fierce&quot;), and when he destroys an entire village, he states it in such a cool and nonchalant way (&quot;and so the village was burnt, and all of the citizens put to the sword.&quot;)  While caeser may not have intended to be funny, this book is a wonderful piece of history which must be taken as a historical tall tale
