A long overdue book, Money Without Matrimony discusses the myriad of financial considerations when two people are living together as a couple but are not married.  In this situation there are many potential problems that can interfere with your planning for your future.  The authors walk the reader down a solid pathway for financial advice by first examining why financial planning is important, determining goals and objectives, dealing with what assets belong to each person and which assets are jointly owned, dealing with insurance, taxes, estate planning, and retirement.  And, of course, children raises another entirely different problem that needs to be examined in detail.  The authors follow a well organized path that leads the reader from thinking about their goals through devising a total plan.  The coverage is excellent and thorough and includes a discussion of such things as common-law marriage states and what to do about it.  Other areas with surprises that are covered in detail include credit cards, life insurance, insurance proceeds, and inheritance.  This is a complex field with many potential pitfalls and problems but also ripe with planning opportunities so that your wishes are met and assets protected.  Money Without Matrimony is highly recommended for all unmarried couples
