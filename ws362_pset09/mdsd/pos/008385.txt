It's nearly impossible for any technical analyst to neglect BB with its assessibility, and it's so logical to learn the tool or expect to get the most of it from the inventor himself. With regard to this book, the good things are: The author did not promote his tool as something invincible. He talked about the limitations of and warned readers of the need for continuous revision. Very smooth writing and an easy read. The bad things are: BB is not really a sophisticated tool at all. So the author had "filled" it up with some stuff that seemed light or marginally helpful to readers who had read over five trading books. I am afraid that comprises of most of the potential buyers coz I think it's hard for novices to spend over thirty bucks for a book that talks only of one single TA tool. Furthermore, I really cant acquire extra knowledge of BB from this book that distinguishes it from other TA books I read before. 

Anyway, I still think this is a good read. Afterall, it costs less than one pip in some futures market and you can definitely save a lot more in case you can use BB to enhance your trading system as the author suggests.
