While I would never presume - as some reviewers might - to misstate what is said in this classic volume and then presume to suggest that &quot;now you don't need to read the book,&quot; I will say that this is an excellent edition of a classic work.  All who have any interest in the history of Darwinian evolution and particularly the historical views of the evolution of man will find this fascinating reading, particularly if the context can be juxtaposed with what has been discovered since Darwin's time.  Of course, times have changed, our hopefully less euro-centric views have been altered and there has been considerable progress through the generations since the original publication by Darwin, and that makes the progress of human knowledge all the more fascinating, as well as the insight Darwin obviously possessed in his day.  This one's a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone interested in the history of science
