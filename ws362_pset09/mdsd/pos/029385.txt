Again I am surprised at the one star ! I wrote this review when I first read the book back in 1998 and still stick by this !!!

This book gets away from the complex plots and world threatening villains usually associated with many of the other books to concentrate on Bond in the limited surroundings of a half finished hotel in Jamaica with the man he is to assassinate. This book seems to centralise more on James Bond the man and his inner thoughts, the lack of action is easily made up for with the mind games between Bond and Scaramanga leading upto the final gun fight !
