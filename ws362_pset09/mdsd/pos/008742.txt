I've only read 3 of Preston/Child's novels, but this team IS remarkably similar to the works of Crichton, and fans of micheal crichton will absolutely enjoy Relic, among other of Preston/Childs books. Relic, like the Crichton works, has the similar trait of mixing fact with fiction, though Crichton's will more likely hold more realistic fiction than such creations as the monster in Relic, but that doesnt make the book any less of a pageturner, thriller, or sci-fi thirst quencher. Since other reviews suggest/compare Relic with Jurassic Park here, my two cents is that altho both deal with evolutionary biology, Jurassic Park will be the better read, because it has more stimulating parts and diologues than Relic, though i don't believe it is entirely fair to judge these authors' first book with Jurassic Park as the backdrop...Relic is more in line with Crichton's Timeline than Jurassic Park i think, because the 'science and discovery' sections of the novel appear more isolated and toward the beginning of the book than say, all the way through (as with Malcolm's periodic (or nonperiodic?) discussions on chaos theory, and the dino info, as well as eventually explained genetic processes providing the basis for the story)....the latter half of Relic is mostly action/suspense, but there is so much of it and it is so well-done that it is really nonetheless of a book. p.s. Relic will have slightly more characterization (tho not very much) than JP
