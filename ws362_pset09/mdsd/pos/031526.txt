As with any collection of short stories, there's some variance in quality here.  Several are three-star, a few are four-star, and two are five-star.  "The Long Watch" is a great character study, with emphasis on loyalty, duty, conscience, and ethics.  The title story, "The Green Hills of Earth" is a wonderful but tragic tale of heroism and bravery, reminiscent of what we saw in the NYFD on 9/11/01. These last two make the whole collection worth buying
