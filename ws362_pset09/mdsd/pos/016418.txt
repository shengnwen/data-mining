This was an outstanding novel! Unfortunately, it is an accurate representation of the civil rights in Birmingham at that time. Birmingham had a dismal record of police brutality and indifference, far worse than most the south. Ms. Naslund does a fine job of balancing the story of a tragic time without the simplicity of finger pointing. I know other southerners who rejected this book as more violent that the times truly were. None of them were from Birmingham in the 60's
