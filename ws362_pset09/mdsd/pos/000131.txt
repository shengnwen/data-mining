I enjoyed this book very much. Others have described its plot so I won't repeat it. The book did not get 5 stars from me because there wasn't enough character development for me to believe the mysterious hero would involve himself in the heroine's cause so quickly. Also, I didn't get a good idea of what the heroine looked like, I couldn't picture her in my mind. But those are minor things - there was so much good to the book that I'm sorry it sat on my shelf for so long before I read it. The hero was sexy, the heroine driven, and the epilogue very satisfying. I would give it 4-1/2 stars. It's definitely going on the keeper shelf.
