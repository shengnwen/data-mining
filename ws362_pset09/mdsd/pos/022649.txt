First, let me say that I like this guy.  Altered Carbon was one of the most intriguing concepts that I've read in sci-fi recently, and this, the follow-up, does not disappoint.  Morgan is certainly a gifted writer and his prose sparkles.  The only issue is that the plot was more complex than it needed to be, resulting in less of an "a ha" and more of a shrug.  But don't let that bother you.  Buy the book.
