Not the most complete book on neurological differential diagnosis (I do not know what book that would be), but is is a treasure simply for its amazing illustrations.  You can actually see things only described about in other texts.  It almost seems like one is at the neuroanatomy lab!  The short vignettes are a nice touch and may be helpful to some.  They serve to break up the text and reinforce the pathology just described.  I think this book is best used by residents
