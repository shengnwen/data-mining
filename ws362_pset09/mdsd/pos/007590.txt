This book fills a need which hasn't been addressed in any other work on Egypt I've seen; Ryan provides an exhaustive, authoritative discussion of ancient Egyptian history, culture,religion, art and daily life that is concise, fast reading, and frequently quite amusing.  In addition, there is information on archeological techniques, travel to Egypt, and a splendid listing of additional resources for further study. The book is fun to read, enlightening no matter how much you think you know about Egypt, and a useful reference source
