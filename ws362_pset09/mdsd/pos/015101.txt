Ok, I must be honest, Zhu Hong (translator) was my Professor for my Chinese Womens Literature class and I might not have read this book otherwise.  That being said, as individual and beautiful as the human mind, Memoir of Misfortune truly is a work of art.  The book is written as an interior monologue by Su XiaoKang as he attempts to deal with the traumatic aftermath of a car accident in New York state.  Blaming himself for the accident and the pain and suffering he has caused his wife, Xiao Kang expands the scope of his questioning to his involvement in the events leading up to Tiananmen Square and his whole life in general.  This book is a testament to one mans spirit that struggles to move on from one hardship to another
