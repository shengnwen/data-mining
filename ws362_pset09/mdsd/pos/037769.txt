About two years ago I got the shock of my life when what I thought was appendicitis turned out to be cancer. As soon as I woke up from the anesthesia and learned the truth I knew I needed to reconnect with God at a level I never had before. I have always loved the Psalms but they seemed a little too far from my experience in my situation. Then I found this book. 

It is a wonderful recasting of the Psalms in a way that opened my heart and my soul to the love of God in exactly the way I needed. When you are going through cancer treatment, one of the hardest things to deal with is fear. It can easily take over your spirit. This book recognizes that fear is a bigger enemy to most modern people than invading Philistines are. It also makes the reader think about God in a new way by avoiding a lot of the titles for God that we all have heard so many times they have become meaningless, and recognizing that God's very nature is love.

If you are suffering through a difficult time, or know someone who is, this book is a valuable help. I have found such comfort in it in some of the scariest times of my life. I can't recommend it highly enough
