I slowly worked my way through this book over that last year and learned quite a lot from it.  From the contents of Neolithic villiages to the slow evolution on Cuniform script from it's origional pictograms.  I was fascinated by the Assyrian's system of empire.  A system that kept things in tact so well that the subsequent empires of the Babylonians, Medes, Persions, and Greeks were able to conquer vast swaths of the world in releativly short time spans.  

I kind of a technically minded person so it's easy for me to forget that this is a "Cultural Atlas".  The book is filled with full-color pictures of ancient art ranging from every-day pottery to artifacts from the greatest temples and palaces of their times.  

I'm a born-again Christian and one reason I got this book to try to get a glimpse of what cultures influenced the ancient Hebrews of the Old Testament and to see what evidence actually exists of the Hebrew monarchy besides the bible and temple ruins (Answer - not a lot).  Roaf does give the Hebrews an honorable mention and often mentions how archaeologists use passages from the Old Testament as a cross-refernce to literature and records from neighboring cultures.  

I gave the book 5 stars but it does have it's flaws.  Many of the figures have a baffling lack of legend and captions to allow a better understanding of what, when, and where one is looking at.  Sometimes one has to look real hard at the map figures to understand exactly what part of Mesopotamia one is looking at as there is no indication of scale or landmarks.

The figures were only a minor nuisance.  Get this book for the great array of photographs and easy read.
