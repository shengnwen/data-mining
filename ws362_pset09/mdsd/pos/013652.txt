Have you been amazed by the things your body can do(and probably cannot do) ... like the great stereo vision, the spatial hearing capability, the ease at which we learn/speak/update multiple languages. How does our brain achieve all this? How does our brain stores and incorporates new information? Where do human emotions come from? What is the reason behind anger, fear and other multitudes of human emotions? What is this thing called consciousness? What is the reason behind the peculiar male, female behaviour? What makes our ties to blood relations so strong? Why we find enjoyment in Art? What is life ... Why do we exist?

I personally have been intrigued by these and more of these questions. Most of the time we relegate answers to these questions to some divine entity and many of them we just take for granted. However, this is one of the books that attempts to answer or shares insights to answers to some of these questions. In short this book is going to blow your mind away(literally & figuratively). This book not only tries to enlighten us but also makes us ask more questions about our own existence. In general author contends that the evolution process contributed towards the development of different faculties. In affect we own most of our cool faculties to survival instinct of our genes. The author(a great scientist) provides some interesting evidences to support his thinking.

One thing I liked about this book is that it is written in a very simple and easy to comprehend language. It avoids references to tongue twisting weird words like Myelography, Parietal, Occipital. Another thing I liked about this book is that it conveys lots of nice information/know-how via the means of references to interesting anecdotes from Calvin and Hobbes, Godfather and like.

All in all this is a must, must read ... it is going to leave your awe-struck!
