I decided it would be entertaining at best if not a little eductaional to see what this book had to say about us guys. To my surprise, ALL OF IT WAS TRUE! As I read it I just kept nodding my head and thinking "Yup, right, I agree there..." I even looked for things to disagree about. It was written as the result of a national survey of over four-hundred young men. It had percentile statistics, and though I may have been in the lower percent on some issues, both sides were presented. No, this is not a stereotype of modern young men, it is simply an accurate portayal of us. I can't say the book would be of any use to guys, (unless you are looking for entertainment) But I would recomend it to any young women who want to figure us out.

That Said...I have one very major problem with this book.  It explains the nature of such things as
-the way guys think
-respond to criticism
-are visually stimualted etc...
But in the area of sexual purity, the authors seem to be giving guys a free ticket to sexual sin.  They explain how guys are sexually driven, but do not do a very good job of saying they need to fight these urges.  They chalk it up to "Guys can't help it, that's how they are, and there's no stopping it", which is nearly what is said!  Reading Every young man's battle is much more useful in challenging men to be pure.  Of course, it was written for girls, but that factor cannot be ignored
