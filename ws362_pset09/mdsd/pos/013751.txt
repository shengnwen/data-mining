I have been training in TCM most of my life now.  The thing about a lot of these transations is that people often make assumptions based on grammer ECT ... about what these books are worth ... my Chinese is OK ... but I don't have perfect grammar and most Chinese respect that.  There is a bit of Chinglish in this book, but it is definately read-able.  The books from the mainland are usually the ones with the clinically tested, and/or properly translated point selections and combinations.  Giovanni's and Deadman's Point Selections are INSANE, most of them make NO sense from the stand point of properly trained traditional Chinese medicine, get this book for the point cominations if anything.

Seriously, don't trust some of the giovanni books ... read Deadman for his commentary it explains the reasons behind why the mainland Chinese make there choices ... but Deadman's point selections lack rational as well.

Yours,
Hastings
