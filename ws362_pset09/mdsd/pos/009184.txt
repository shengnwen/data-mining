He wrote them so well. Even though this plot exists in a cold war context and apartheid in South Africa provides the chief motivation of the central character, this work's clear-eyed writing and well-constructed action engage the reader still. It's Graham Greene's sensibility that keeps things fresh. His understanding of ambiguities, ironies, and vast areas of human behavior can be seen everywhere. What the world considers heroes and villains are not so easily reduced to such simple formulations in Greene's world. The government must defend the nation, even at the expense of its own citizens. Lives are expendable. The fascinating realm of espionage is vastly treacherous, and otherwise nice, bland, even literary human beings are capable of lies, betrayal, and murder. Some  are "company" men, and like so many businessmen, they are loyal to the company's mission, and will make whatever sacrifices are needed to ensure order and safety and reputation. Dr. Percival, for instance, does his job well. He could just as easily be a senior VP in any Fortune 500 company. The worst thing one can do to undo the company's mission is to form attachments. Greene quotes his favorite author, Joseph Conrad, "I only know that he who forms a tie is lost. The germ of corruption has entered into his soul." It is Maurice Castle who is attached, while others around him are organization men living in secrecy and suspicion. The joy of Greene's books is to feel the characters come alive. These are people who, back in the 1970s, still cared about literature and what people like Tolstoy and Trollope had to say. The Everyman edition is well designed, and a handy timeline in the front places this work in the context of Greene's output. An excellent introduction by Peter Kemp helps us understand the roots of this work and Greene's struggles with it.
