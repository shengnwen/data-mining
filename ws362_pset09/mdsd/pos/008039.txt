John Walvoord's commentary on Daniel has been a great help as I have endeavored to understand the Book of Daniel.  I thought that Walvoord argued his interpretation well and felt his inclusion of scholars such as Keil, Leupold, Gaebelein, and others provided excellent insight.  Walvoord is concerned with showing the discrepancies and inaccuracies in the interpretation of liberal scholars, such as Montgomery.  Walvoord contronts those who take a second century B.C. date for the Book of Daniel head on, and shows the illogical process of their thought.  Walvoord shows both their preconceived misconceptions of prophecy and authorship, as well as inaccurate conclusions on those misconceptions. 	The book also discusses evangelicals who are different in interpretations from amillennial and premillennial positions.  There are arguments among scholars over the smallest of things such as rivers, and to things of enormous significance, such as the interpretation of Media-Persia as the second empire, or the second and third empires. 	However, it was clear that Walvoord wrote from a scholarly standpoint and was not very concerned with the edification of the reader.  While the mind was challenged greatly to think, the heart was hardly even warmed over the historical, and hermeneutical debate.  Walvoord fails to explain the significance of the Book of Daniel as giving great hope to us that God is faithful to his promises, that He is sovereign over the governments of men, and that upon the culmination of the end, He will still be in complete control.  This is why I say the book is four stars rather than five. The book fed the mind in ample portions, but the spirit is only fed by the actual Biblical text on which Walvoord comments
