There are a lot of very public debates about science, and one thing comes through loud and clear; namely, that the American public has very little idea what science is in the first place. Books like this could help to improve that.

If you're a fan of Park's APS newsletter, then the style will be familiar, but while his acerbic wit is never far below the surface, he also does an effective job of educating the reader as to what science really is, and more importantly what it isn't.

The only reason I'm giving this four stars rather than five is that I found the whole "belief gene" discussion a bit on the pop. sci. side for my taste.

I still definitely recommend the book
