Margaret Gunther's book on Spiritual Direction is an excellent resource for all persons who are professionally involved in soul care, whether clergy, counselors, retreat directors, or spiritual directors.  I've read many books on this subject, yet this one kept me engaged from cover to cover.  I read it in one evening.  If you are involved in spiritual ministry to people, get this book.

That being said, I wish Gunther had added two more chapters.  I am sure she is qualified and I would like to hear her views on a couple of related subjects.

I wish she had set aside a chapter dedicated to future goals in spiritual direction.  Her first two chapters on Holy Listening (introduction), Welcoming the Stranger (chapter one), and Good Teachers (chapter 2) were first class.  Her chapter on Midwife to the Soul (chapter 3) didn't keep my attention as well, but was a great transitional chapter that brought a climax to her entire work.  I wish she had inserted a chapter here on the ongoing relationship between the director and directee.  She could have encouraged the director in hers or his own personal growth, identified some dangers involved with long term relationships, and given clearer advice on knowing when and how to break the relationship.  She could have laid out some long term goals for spiritual direction.

I also wish Gunther had added a chapter on Men and Spiritual Direction.  She is a woman and the majority of persons who come for spiritual direction are women (page 119).  Still a nice chapter specifically focused on men would have been the perfect "icing on the cake" for this book.  I am sure she would have done a good job.  All through her book, Guenther writes with a sensitivity that is alluring to both men and women.

The inclusion of these two chapters would have bumped my score from a 4.5 to a solid 5 stars.  As it is now, I'm just going to have to search through amazon.com for more works by this author.
