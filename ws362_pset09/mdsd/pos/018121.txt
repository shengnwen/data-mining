Once in a while, there comes a book that has a chance to stand out from the deluge of other books currently being published on Paganism and Wicca.  Where there seems to be an overwhelming tendancy to keep on printing and reprinting books which seem to be 'how to guides' on everything from ritual to spellcraft, there never seems to be *any* book which will focus on how to live as a Pagan.

If you're someone who is tired with the 'same old' syndrome, then this book will feel like a breath of fresh air.  This book really talks about everything relating to living a Pagan life in a mundane day-to-day world.  It will talk about how to be better at being environmentally aware and offers tips and suggestions to help you.  It deals about ethics from a practical stand point as opposed to just talking about the theory behind the ethics.  It's simple, down to earth, and wonderfully enjoyable to read and a welcome addition in a subject that lacks and overlooks this kind of book.

I highly recommend the book to someone who considers themselves Pagan
