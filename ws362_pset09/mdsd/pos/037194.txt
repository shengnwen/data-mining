As a licensed Interior Designer I refer to this book frequently. To determine the space required for any activity from opening a file drawer to dining, watching a movie or simply removing an object from a shelf this book gives it to you straight with no fluff. It contains simple but indispensible scientific data for the 95th percentile and beyond. Whether you are a student or a professional, in Interior Design, Architecture or Industrial Design I highly recommend Human Dimension and Interior Space
