This is a good book. It would be better if the author had had the courage to cut some 80 of its 240 pages or so. It would be better still if he had also added some pages on the operational aspects of commodities trading.
	Jim Rogers is knowledgeable and it shows. He writes clearly and gracefully and this keeps the reader turning the pages as quickly as he can. The only problem is when describes the commodities he likes or dislikes most. He delves into too many details. Details not useful for those who only want to learn how to invest. That's when he sounds ostentatious; it detracts from the elegance he otherwise displays.
	The reader could benefit a lot more if the book had more information on the operational side of buying commodities. Practical hints on how and when to buy and sell, for instance.
	All in all, this is a good book. Good value for your money.

PS -- An important omission is that the author does not develop the ideia of buying indexes instead of buying the "real" thing. This is a serious omission since investing in indexes is a way to make money with commodities without having to get into the details of each one of them
