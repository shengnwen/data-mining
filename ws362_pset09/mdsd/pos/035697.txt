What a book!!  I know the author but never expected to read a story like this.  He wrote one of the most amazing real-life books I have ever read. I enjoyed it so much, I could not put it down it took me only two days on the train to read it, that is how good it is. I can only hope that it brings him much success and hope he continues to write more books like this one
