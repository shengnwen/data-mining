  Far North was an excellent book! It shows the spirit of true survival. I really enjoyed this book because it was exciting and was full of action. Also, it was so detailed that I could picture what was going on. The author of this story made it seem so real that I could feel the emotions of the characters and felt that I was actually there. One part that actually really got to me is when Johnny Raven died, I really felt as if I was there.  Far North was a very well written story.

  In this paragraph I will be comparing Far North with another book. This book reminds me of several other stories that I have read about survival.  It especially reminds me of the book Hatchet. The reason is because of the circumstances. In both stories a plane crashes and the characters have to find some way to survive. Both Hatchet and Far North are very well written books. They both include a lot of detail and I would definitely give both a five star rating. Those are my feelings on Far North.
