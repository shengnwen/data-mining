This book is the best book on birthday traits I have ever read, far more accurate than the Language of Birthdays (though that book isn't bad).  I couldn't believe how on point it was about everyone, and I do mean everyone, I showed it to.  I always look up the b-days of people after I've gotten to know them, just to see how accurate it is, and it has not been wrong so far.  Only negative is that it's not always right about the love &amp; relationships/fatal attractions/soul mates, etc.  Still, it's a book worth every penny
