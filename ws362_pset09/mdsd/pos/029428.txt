I found Easy Spanish Reader to be an indispensable help in my quest to perfect my Spanish.  The gradual sequence of less difficult to more difficult was helpful and the stories are interesting.  The price is also quite good.
Hint:  If you wish a truly inexpensive reader/reference guide to the Spanish language, try Language Dynamics Spanish Book for $11.00 on Amazon.  Amazingly simple, this text will give you complete same-page translations of very short and easy to understand stories and dialogs.
My text helped me immensely with Easy Spanish Reader because it allowed me to 'build up' to a more sophisticated reading level (once I was reading at a native speakers' second grade level, this became easy).
Getting to the native speakers' second grade reading level is NOT easy, and this is where Language Dynamics Spanish Book saved me.
By the way, when you are ready to actually 'speak' the language, try 'Behind the Wheel Spanish' 8 CDs and text.  Great course!
