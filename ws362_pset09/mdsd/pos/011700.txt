I personally love thriller novels that aren't afraid to get visceral and violent, and this one doesn't disappoint. As for the storyline, I was a bit skeptic about the Jack the Ripper tie in, to me using that as a reference for why someone is killing is a bit of a cop out, but it worked out pretty well without becoming to bogged down in the legend. The characters, well fleshed out, good back round, but sometimes a little "too" perfect. Callie Thorne, a beautiful hard nosed smart detective oh and she likes calling everyone "honey-love", she will use this phrase about seventy million times, and that's only in the first two pages she is in. If anyone I knew, used a pet name like that, I wouldn't be their friend for long. The overall feel was a bit predictable (Surprise the killer is among you, how else would he know so much!) but enjoyable to read. For a first book, its amazing, and I would read more of this authors in the future
