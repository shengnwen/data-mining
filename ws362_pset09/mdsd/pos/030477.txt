Originally, I received this book as a "gift" (I asked for it, actually) because I saw how many of the patterns were so unique.  I've looked EVERYWHERE for patterns for some of the different totes and bags included in this book! (such as the yoga bag, and the all-day tote) Plus, I'm one of those people who just can't bring themselves to just cut into a piece of material without a pattern guiding their way very easily, so I've always been scared to attempt a duvet cover, although I figured I could stumble my way through it.  Now I have the PERFECT pattern!  Plus, all the pictures within the book are so inspiring!  I highly recommend this to any young sewer, whether you're experienced or not.  There are so many unique projects in here that you'll never regret it
