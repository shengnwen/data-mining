Slaughterhouse five is by far a great pies of work by Kurt Vonnegut. The story's plot focuses on the life of the protagonist named Billy. The story can be a little complicated being that it is a story in a story of the author's who is a character in the book.
The book more or less has no structure in it. The plot structure cannot be described as linear, but rather it is more spatial in its organization. the style of the story to me was almost bleak and depressing, with a subtle mention of science-fiction in it
