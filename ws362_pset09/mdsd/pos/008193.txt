Life with Art takes the reader through a very informative subject in a concise, but detailed, manner.  Beautiful illustrations of artwork being discussed don almost every page.  The book is separated into twenty-one  chapters which allows the reader to follow art through history, study the  different types of art medium, and learn enough about art vocabulary to  write a critical analysis.  A must for all art students!!
