  Finally, a nice, good teenage novel that doesn't require use of love stories, text language and cheerleaders to score with readers. 

  I was a little skeptical of it at first as Drugs aren't really my type of a good read, but Kate drew me in from the first page and from then on, the ride was smooth and captivating. There are rarely books that can lure me into their world. I admitt I can get picky at times, and if a book fails to bring me in in time, I will immediately abandon it. However, Jude managed to do it for me.

  A good plot, simple but effective expression and overall a recommendatio
