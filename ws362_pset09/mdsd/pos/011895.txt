In "Bad Lie," John Corrigan's latest and finest book featuring pro-golfer Jack Austin, the author provides tournament-winning prose, plotting and character development.  The skillfully crafted ending surprised even this voracious (three or four novels per week) consumer of fiction!  Players and lovers of golf have already provided favorable reviews of Corrigan's knowledge of the game and the realties of life on the pro tours.  Being neither a player nor lover of the game, I shall confine my comments to matters that I care about.  What impresses me most about "Bad Lie" is Corrigan's insights into and sensitivities to the realties of life for those of his characters who deviate from the stereotypical image of golfers, attendants and fans as being predominantly white, Anglo-Saxon, heterosexual, upper or upper-middle class, dominant males.  A major character in "Bad Lie" is a woman with two children and a militarily-disabled husband to care for at home on her "Wal-Mart Associate" cash-register attendant's salary.  Jack Austin accepts and treats his journalist wife, Lisa, as an equal in every respect (as well he should, since she is).  They have adopted an African-American son, born and raised on the hard streets of Roxbury, Massachusetts.  Jack's caddy is gay and one of his best pro-golfer friends is a "fallen" Catholic priest who innocently attracts women like bees to honey.
In "Bad Lie," John Corrigan indisputably proves his extraordinary talent as a writer, his love and knowledge of golf, and most of all his humanity!
