I am a big Seth Godin fan, back from the days when "Permission Marketing" wrote the rules for email/web-based marketing.

Using that as a benchmark, very few match up, but this is still an interesting read. It's not in any way a waste of time as some reviewers seem to think. A step below "Purple Cow" and "Free Prize Inside," and a couple steps below "Permission Marketing."

In baseball terms, it would be a double.

He sets the bar high, and nobody can live up to that mark on every offering. Give it a chance before you judge it on the bad reviews you read here.

Go Seth!
