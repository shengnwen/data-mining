I am a college student.  A friend of mine has had a threesome but he is the only one I know who has done this.  In my opinion, save yourself a few dollars and don't buy the book.  If you want a threesome become better at talking to people, and start hanging out at places or on websites where that kind of thing happens more often.  It shouldn't be that difficult, but it might take you a while which isn't going to change if you buy this book.  If you want a really good book which will bring you far better results as far as having a better sex life which can easily bring about a threesome, read How to Succeed with Women by Ron Louis and David Copeland.  These guys are worth reading
