Those looking for a good reference to start learning about star stories and legends will find a good tool in this book.

What I liked more was the different cultures kept in mind while narrating a story. Often, we see that only Greek Mythology is considered; this book keeps an eye to the other corners of the ancient world.

Perfect for those involved in astronomical education and public outreach
