This 543-page compilation, The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery by Bruce Murphy, will likely appeal to mystery buffs, especially those interested in authors from past years.

Some entries are quite short, while others like Ellery Queen spanned two pages. Most entries are authors, but we also find classic titles like The Postman Always Rings Twice, Coffin for Dimitrios, Fer-De-Lance, The Big Clock, Murder on the Orient Express, and The Roman Hat Mystery.

My favorites were always present: Colin Dexter, P. D. James, G. K. Chesterton, Robert Van Gulik, Ellery Queen, John MacDonald, Ross MacDonald, Nicholas Blake, Cornell Woolrich, Dorothy Sayers, Conan Doyle, Wilkie Collins, Arturo Perez-Reverte, and Dashiell Hammett.

Lesser known authors include Fergus Hume (The Mystery of a Hansom Cab, 1886), Maurice Leblanc (Arsene Lupin stories, early 1900s), R. Austin Freeman (Dr. Thorndyke stories, 1907- 1930s), Cyril Hare (Suicide Excepted, 1939), and Elliot Paul (The Mysterious Mickey Finn, 1939).  I recall only two searches in which I was unsuccessful: R. T. Campbell (Bodies in a Bookshop, 1946) and H. F. Wood (The Passenger from Scotland Yard, 1888).

Many writers known in other literary genre at one time or another penned mystery stories. Examples include Mario Vargas Llosa, Charles Dickens, Honore De Balzac, Isaac Asimov, Henry James, Edgar Allen Poe, Ray Bradbury, Alexandre Dumas, Friedrich Durrenmatt, Jorge Luis Borges, Mark Twain, and J. Sheridan Le Fanu.

For those readers that do enjoy not only reading books, but also reading about books and authors, The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery by Bruce Murphy would make a good gift.

Caution:  The list price for The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery by Bruce Murphy is rather high, and the prudent buyer should look for substantial discounts. I paid a small fraction of the list price for a new copy
