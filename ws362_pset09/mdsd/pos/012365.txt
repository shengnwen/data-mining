When you think of crime fiction you think of cities and the writers who depict them in their books; Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Walter Mosley-Los Angeles...Carl Hiassen-South Florida...Lawrence Block-New York....Ed McBain-a city like New York and so on. No writer does Washington DC like George Pelecanos.

He grew up there. He knows those gritty streets. This new book is a real departure for the author. Its the story of 3 cops who are trying to solve an ancient crime. one retired, one fired, the last, a veteran cop.. a family man. Years ago somebody was killing children and leaving their bodies near community gardens. Then it stopped. The three cops who were on the original cases went their separate ways.

Then it starts happening again. Pelecanos crafts a noir thriller. Well worth the read
