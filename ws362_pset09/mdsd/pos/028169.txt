This book is extremely well researched and well written.  The author points to conflicting tendencies in Weinberg's personal letters.  Shapiro points to the one's that indicate a modern-orthodox view of Weinberg, while  dismissing the other letters as the one Weinberg did not actually mean.   Indeed, Shapiro apologizes for not having had access to too many of the  other kinds of letters which most assuredly exist
