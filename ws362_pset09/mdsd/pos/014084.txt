"The Awakening of Intelligence" made me contemplate deeply on the common emotions and issues we face everyday. The book uses simple text to convey great depth of thought. Reading the book heightened my awareness of the collective spirit/consciousness that we create. The book throws light on the perils of conditioned /habituated thinking. Aptly titled, this book urges the reader to brush off the weight that we carry in our lives, and embarks the reader into an enlightening journey. I wonder if anyone can keep this book down, without completing it! This book is a must read and it holds a treasure of timeless wisdom
