Delia, oh Delia. The woman who taught me how to make toast!  (I was actually making it wrong all these years...) Delia is one of those  television personalities who you really would like to have as a friend. Her  books are extremely personable and can literally be read aloud - gives you  that &quot;Delia is in the house&quot; feeling. The Summer and Winter  Collections are Superb books. Also check out How to Cook One and Two.  Excellent. Now, where can I buy the How to Cook video collection
