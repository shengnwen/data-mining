Every generation produces one book that remains a "Classic" and is found in every home..."Organic Housekeeping" by Ellen Sandbeck is just such a book. It is an amazing compilation of
"What everyone needs to know" about taking care of a home. I have sent it as a gift to many family and friends and recommend
it highly.  Rheta B Tempe
