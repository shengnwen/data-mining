Davis is so classy a person and a talented golfer.  What about that shot on 17th at Augusta?  This book tugs at your heart relating the death of his father.  Then the episode with his first major and the rainbow.  His brother caddying.  The eleven cent putting drill (I keep the putter and eleven cents in the den for practice since then.)  This endures many who never pulled for this humble man cheer for another big win for DL3 and the rest of his legion fans pull for another title for our hero!  Keep on being you, DL3.  You and Freddie are our guys.  Thanks for this read
