Ok, lets get this straight. I'm not under 13 I just don't feel like typing stuff in. I'm sure some people are probably saying"Oh, she's lying". But,no. Just because you hate me doesnt mean the world hates me.

This book is good for anyone who likes cooking and friendship. I gave a copy of this to my best friend and she just loved it. She's really into the whole friendship deal.

One bad thing about this book-or this series- is that they hardly have any vegetarian recipes in the back of the book. I would sure like it if they did though. *hint hint*

I'd really like to make a club like dish with my friends but I wouldn't know where to start. If anyone else would like to do that then just include it at the bottom of the review.

Thanx,
Lor K
