I have to admit I haven't read this all yet.  That's why I can't give it more than 4 stars so far.  I have read enough to get an idea of what reciepts to save and, when discussing tax issues with fellow landlords, I've found quick answers to all our questions so far.  And, I, who am somewhat tax illiterate, even understand the answers I've found! I have to read this book - I've purchased a lot of books on landlording and real estate investing and read most of them but still have no solid idea about how I'm going to deal with my taxes this year (first time rental house owner this year).  I know this is a very necessary read for me but, who wants to read about TAXES?? - what a bore!!   I am confident, however, due to what I've explored so far in this book, that this will prepare me well to get the full legal tax advantage from my landlording business
