My best friend gave me this book as a present and i was happy to get this book:).if you have a shrewd sense of humor then this is for you.you can take this book literally and kudos to you but i think i'll stay within the norm and read it and laugh at what I could have done for that day.this book offer 365 things to do so if you don't like today's tasks you can always turn the next page.i keep this book out while i'm taking study breaks and read a few pages
