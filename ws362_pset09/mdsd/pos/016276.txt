One thing you will notice with these reviews, is that not a single review, either positive or negative, has gotten good feedback ratings. That is because fundamentalist Christians will give good feedback to all reviewers that liked the book, and skeptics will do the same for those who give bad feedback to it.

Your beliefs are yours. Neither this book, or "The case for christ" is going to convert anyone. If you already believed Jesus did not exist, you will enjoy the book, but if you're a fundamental christian or apologist, this book is not going to change your mind.

However, having read both books, I found that the evidence presented in Earl's book to be more convincing than the book it critiques. The critics of Lee Strobel's book point out specifics as to why his book does not hold water, whereas the critics of Earl Doherty's book attack the author, and not the evidence.

Do not put any stock into ANY reviews, because their integrity is compromised by true believers who will manipulate review feedback not necessarily based on the quality of the review, but on the premise that the reviewer's viewpoints differ to that of their own.

Do not read this book if you are a christian. You will not like it, in principle, before you even read the book. You will have made up your mind to not like it. It will not change your mind, and therefore it will be a pointless read. Read this book if you are unbiased. And if you are a skeptic, then this book will give you confirmation of your own opinions and beliefs
