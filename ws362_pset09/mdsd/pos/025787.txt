Prince Carrick and Lady Gwen, supernatural star-crossed lovers, have a curse upon them. If three siblings can fall in love they can be reunited through death and time. Aidan Gallagher and Jude Francis (Jewels of the Sun) were pretty easy, Shawn Gallagher and Brenna O'Toole (Tears of the Sun) proved more challenging, but Carrick ain't seen nuthin' yet when it comes to directing the lives of mortals.

Darcy Gallagher, witchy and beautiful, shallow and classy, has a beautiful singing voice, a capable manner, and a stunningly practical heart that doesn't want to ever be tied down.

One look at her and prodigal son Trevor Magee is smitten. Back in town to build a theater, lured there by Darcy's brother Shawn's immense singing/songwriting talent, he is staying in lady Gwen's old cottage and sees her ghost nightly. He knows the tales and isn't fazed, not even when a petulant Carrick chews him out for moving too slowly.

However, fiercely independent Darcy wants no part in falling in love, losing control, and marrying. She knows how to handle most rich men but gorgeous Trevor is too hot to handle, and her games are child's play to him.

They clash and have brilliant dialogue, the sexual tension is just delicious. The supernatural characters, most notably Carrick, seem so real and are brilliantly written.

This book is about destiny in part, but most of all it is about the beauty and purity of love, how it scares us all. It can tear you apart and make you whole, the greatest adventure in life. Watching Trevor and Darcy take the ride is enthralling.

As a stand-alone this novel is delectable, but as the conclusion to a brilliant trilogy it is a must-not-miss novel by the accomplished master, Nora Roberts, of all things love and Irish
