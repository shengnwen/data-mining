While not particularly deep, this book covers a lot  of territory and fills in a lot of background to what has been my sketchy knowledge of circus life.  I'm not really interested in circuses, but this was an interesting book and gave yet another dimension to my understanding of the Great Depression.  Some of the minor characters take on real depth, including Walter, some of the general circus laborers, and, of course, Rosie.  And it really purges the emotions and releases a lot of pent up anger in a hilarious and horrible act of vengence.  

This is a good and well-told story.
