As a mystery Memory was not her greatest book. I read these books less for the mystery plot but more for the character developement and interactions. I think when you read a "series" involving the same characters they become as important as or more important than the actual plot. Eve Dallas has come a long way since Naked in Death. The books are a bit repetitive about her past abuse, etc. but show her evolving personally - she is developing more insight into her interactions and feeling for people around her.  A softer side of Eve Dallas showed in this book.
