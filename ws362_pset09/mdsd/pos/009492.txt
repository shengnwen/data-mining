i owned this book many years ago when i thought i was the only person in the world who felt the way i did. the book was very helpful in letting me know i was not alone. it eased my mind and i carried it around with me everywhere i went for support. i lost my first copy in one of our moves and as my life got better i forgot how helpful the book had been. well my shrink brought the book up in one of our sessions and i knew i had to own it again. i still feel the same peace when i read about symptoms and feelings i believe are only my own. i reccomend this book very highly. it is really on target with anxiety and panic disorders. you will not only receive helpful information you will also realize you are not alone in your struggle. m/a 200
