This book has been around forever (apparently Bill Clinton mentiones it in his autobiography), but the ideas are solid, good ones.  I agree with the other reviewers that it is dated, that's true, but get over it, it's still a good book.  So many other "modern" approaches like Covey and Tony Robbins borrow a great deal from Alan Lakein.

Well worth the money
