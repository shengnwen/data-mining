The thought of witchcraft may bring about images of flying broomsticks and bubbling cauldraons, green faced hags waiting to butcher your children and house pets. But did you know witchcraft is really a religion that is officially recognized by the U.S. government? Witches do not recruit people via missionaries, but yet still is among the world's fastest growing religions. Numbers estimate members in the millions to as low as several thousand. This is one of the better disinformation guides I have seen on the subject of witchcraft, and while the deceased author's idea of what is normal may differ from my own, we are on the same page as to what is and what is not practicing witchcraft. Don't believe the Hollywood hype of talk show grabage, find out for yourself. Go to a local pagan shop or seek out a local coven. But be warned- they'll make you think they're your friend because they don't appear to be jocks or corporate or holier than thou religious zealots, and they're even worse than Christian missionaries. Until there are Wiccan characters on mainstream TV stations like CBS, NBC or ABC, it is going to continue to be a third rate religion with juvenile, closeted followers. Like SAtanism, in the hands of more talented people, this could've been a real statement. Instead, the only thing most will say is- get a life
