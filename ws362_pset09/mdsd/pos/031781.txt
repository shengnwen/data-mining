The APA Style:  Student Workbook and Training Guide is an excellent tool for any college student at any level.  I am in my senior year of college and have struggled with my writing abilities from the beginning.  Thanks to this Workbook, I was able to narrow down my weaknesses and actually work on my problematic areas like:  grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.  

The spiral notebook style of this book comes in very handy when studying the book itself or using it as a reference book when writing papers.  I recommend this book to anyone needing help with problematic writing errors or just need an APA Style Manual to assist with references.
