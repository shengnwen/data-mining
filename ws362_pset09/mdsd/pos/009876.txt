This is not a book that will tell you the specifics of exactly how the genome is being/has been mapped. If that's what you want, get another book. If, however, you are looking for a behind-the-scenes look at the race to crack the genome, this is the book for you. You'll hear stories pertaining to some of the leading scientists in the field. I read it and enjoyed it, but I am a genetics major in college, so I obviously like genetics. I would suggest that you read this only if you are already interested in the subject, otherwise you will be bored
