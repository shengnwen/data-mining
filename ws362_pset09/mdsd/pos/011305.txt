Jules Verne's "Around the world in 80 days" is a well-written novel detailing the adventures one man faces as he races the clock to journey around the world.  The main character, Mr. Fogg, is a wealthy Brit who lives a fairly anonymous existence.  People are intrigued by this air of mystery.

As a result of a bet, Mr. Fogg finds himself faced with the incredibly difficult task of this journey and a large sum of money (and his pride) on the line. Set in the 1800's, this journey shows the reader how different life was then. 

Now, being so used to instantaneous everything, you might expect the story to feel dated.  Not so.  Verne uses common language so there is not the expected difficulty of translating old english into something you actually understand.
The story is exciting, unpredictable, filled with interesting situations and characters.

This is an easy, enjoyable way to spend a few hours of your time
