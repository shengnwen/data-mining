Robert Wilson is at his best when he writes about Africa or Seville. Of the 2 books based in Lisbon, not this one but the other one (A small death in Lisbon) is better but the plot is somewhat unconventional so my suggestion would be to start with this one. Yes, it is yet another World War II story but the plot should keep you intrigued enough not to want to put it down.
If, after reading this one, you like his style then go and buy the other books as well. You won't be disappointed.
It really rates 4 stars and a half...but Amazon forces you to choose one or the other
