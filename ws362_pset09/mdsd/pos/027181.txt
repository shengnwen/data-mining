The Big Book O' Beer; the title says it all. I recieved this precious gem as a gift and I am proud to own this intelligent, witty, and surprisingly informative conglomerate of beer facts. For those who consider themselves beer fanatics to those who indulge in a few barley pops every now and again, I highly encourage you to get your hands on a copy of this book. The only thing that excites me more than this book is free beer. Cheers and happy reading:
