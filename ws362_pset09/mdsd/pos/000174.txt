The daughter of a friend of mine is a PhD student of Wrangham's at Harvard, which is how I was introduced to this book (I borrowed their autographed copy).   _Demonic Males_ is easy to read and fascinating, dispelling the myth that apes in the wild are peaceful; in fact they rape, kill each other for no reason, and have turf wars just like humans.  One exception, Wrangham points out, is the incredible bonobo, a species of ape which evolved differently and enjoys a peaceful societal communion.  The most interesting aspect of the book to me involved evolution: Wrangham describes how there was a cataclysmic event in Africa which caused chimps to split off into two separate groups.  One of those groups, because they had to become land-dwellers, eventually evolved into hominids.  An amazing book which helps the reader  to understand that we are biologically disposed to war;  unfortunately, because of this it is also rather depressing
