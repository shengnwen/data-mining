Anne Tyler is the master chronicler of the family; she has written about so many aspects of the family that it seems that some readers are tiring of her plots and characters.  "Back When We Were Grownups" is the story of a woman who frets and worries about all the members of her family that she neglects herself.  Only when she is middle-aged does she realize that there is no one to care about her.  There are no jarring twists of plot or dazzling characters in Anne Tyler's novels.  Rather, there are the simple, yet profound observations of family life and the unravelling of life's mysteries.  Tyler graces us with the gift of the expected in unexpected ways
