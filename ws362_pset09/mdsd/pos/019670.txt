Amy is the main character in the story.  Her family is moving way.  She doesn't want to leave her house, her garden and he friends.  She is sad when she first moves to her new home.  Soon she starts to like to her new home.  She meets new friends and she and her dad plan a new flower garden. 

The book has characters that young children could relate to.  If kids ever had to move they would be able to understand Amy's feelings.
I would recommend this to families who might be moving soon.  They can read this book and discuss the way their child feels about the move.
