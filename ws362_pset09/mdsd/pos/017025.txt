Miller does it again.  Only better.  Filled with copious sourcing and research, he presents an irrefutable critique of the current administration.  Well, let's be honest.  If you are a right-wing Republican, you won't agree with what he says, and there's really no reason to read the book.  It'll just make you angry.  Every one else- read it.  It is shocking how often this administration has flouted the law and grinned while doing it.  Unlike Miller's previous work, Bush Dyslexicon, this is short on humor.  While Dyslexicon attempted to use humor to make a serious point, Cruel and Unusual simply hammers home the horrific nature of the world we live in.  I look forward to 2008, but with a certain sence of dread.  Will he subvert the contstitution again, and somehow circumvent 22nd Ammendment, claiming exigencies because we are at "war"?

I'd love to give this book a full rating.  It's a must-read.  It could change your understanding of the modern world under Pax Americana (a Bush quote).  But that final chapter- a bit too much.  There Miller posits a shadowy group, the Christian Reconstructionists, and aligns the administration with them.  I have no doubt they exist and they pursue a rather evil agenda- I have no reason to doubt Miller's research on these points.  Rather, he uses similar viewpoints espoused by Bush & Company that are similar to those of the Reconstructionists to demonstrate the proposed link.  However, much as I disagree with most of the viewpoints, most of them are simply conservative beliefs- and some of them rather simply Christian beliefs.  Miller's arguments get bogged down in his final chapter.  Read the book for the rest of it
