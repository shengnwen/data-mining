Amanda Miranda by Richard Peck was a wonderful book.  The plot line was excellent and the characters were delightful.  This book is definitely for a person that likes twisting, romantic story lines.  It was almost as if there were secrets hidden in the pages of the book itself.  The book took so many turns you couldn't tell what would happen next.  A few things that I saw the same in the book and the actual sinking of the Titanic were when Miranda was on the great ship, she described the people that were on the ship in first and second class.  People such as, Molly Brown and Mr. and Mrs. Macy.  Another similarity was the description she gave when only a few people on the sinking ship knew that the ship had hit an iceberg and that they were sinking.  Some of the upper-class men and women thought nothing of it and did not bother to put on their lifejackets only to be the first ones escorted off the Titanic.  Amanda Miranda is both factual and entertaining.  I fully recommend this book to a young adult reader
