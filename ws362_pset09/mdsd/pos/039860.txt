This is a book with the book-on-tape, read by the author, enclosed.  I CAN DO IT is all about affirmations and changing your life with affirmations.  The spoken word on this CD is incredibly powerful.  Louise supportivly walks the reader (and listener) through a discussion on the usefulness of affirmations for several areas including health, wealth/prosperity, job happiness, relationships, self-esteem and stress.  She then gives sample affirmations for each catagory.  I listen to the CD when I drive, as suggested on the CD cover, and I feel empowered to create the life I want!  I drive around saying affirations out loud, including "I am totally adequate for all situations", so empowering
