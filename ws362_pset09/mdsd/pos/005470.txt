Dallas is at the top of her game with this novel.  The suspense she creates is superb, and this book makes for delicious reading.  In a break from her previous novels, she's moved this tale out of the 19th century, but the past can't be forgotten in this tale of a Southern family and the remnants of a society still clinging to the values found in the Old South.  This one successfully made its way around my circle of reading friends
