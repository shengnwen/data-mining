I was pleased to discover this book from a review in the Orlando Sentinel.  It explains why certain spaces in a home may be beautifully decorated, yet not feel right.  The author says, "feeling at home isn't about spending money."  Our bedrooms should reflect our private self and the living room our best self.  
This book makes you rethink the spaces in your home and tells you why some area work for you and others just don't have the feel you want.
