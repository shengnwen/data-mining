The book if fun to read.  Buy it.  All right, borrow it from your library.  This travel-food-olog mixes wild & interesting places and wild & interesting foods in about equal amounts.  Yes, Mr. Bourdain does write like a chef, but what the heck?  In his words, that's "pretty neat."

At all these wild places he goes -- Russia, North Africa, Vietnam, Japan -- one wonders how he survives both the places and the meals.  The answer is, he threw himself into both with a gusto and with good expectations.  This unintended lesson on life would be hard to improve on.  Readers will be pleased to note how Mr. Bourdain leaves all his hosts delighted with his visit.  This makes him the perfect guest.  Very likely the aged Vietnamese army veteran was especially so, ever after being able to boast that he drank an American under the table.

His hosts liked him because he liked them, without prejudice.  What a wonderfully entertaining book this is.  If this man can find the value, and the fun, in all that he ran into, you can't help but put the book down a bit more inspired
