My book was about a young boy name John. He was in a boat crash. Everyone died but him. HE was on a island. ON the island he saw some people. On the island his clothes got messed up his clothes so Simon gave him so. Simon is one of the peoples that he saw.
 The reason why I didn't like this book is because that it was not in California in wasn't about TUPAC in it didn't have me in it. My favorite seen was when John got shot. It was so funny. That's all folks.
