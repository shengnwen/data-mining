I really enjoy King and have read many of his books.  I almost gave up on this one (which I never do) around page 200.  I started thinking, man King could write 300 pages about a dime sitting on a shelf if he really wanted to (or a girl cuffed to a bed).  

This story really gets going around page 225 or so, and seems to me this first part of the book could have been edited down to around 50 pages. In the end King did not let me down... Stick with it, I think you'll enjoy it.  If you're looking for "top shelf" King, invest your time in the Dark Tower series - you will not regret it
