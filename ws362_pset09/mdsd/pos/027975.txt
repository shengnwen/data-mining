This is a very comprehensive compilation of the most important classic short stories as well as some newer stories from today's writers.  I thought the book was very well organized, especially with the case files and interviews that accompany several of the stories.  

There are a few omissions of some classics but nonetheless I felt it was a very good collection.

A must have if studying Fiction
