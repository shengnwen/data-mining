I was hooked on this trilogy after reading the first of the series.  I found the second book a bit forced, but really enjoyed the third and final installment.  I hate to say goodbye to these characters and their enchanting home of Harper House.  I was glad to learn the final resting place of Amelia and really enjoyed the ghost/haunting aspect of this romantic series
