I related to and thoroughly enjoyed this book. Conway's descriptions of Australia are beautiful.  She has written a follow-up book which I would like to read also.  And on second reading, I feel more and more that perhaps her mother had some chemical imbalance, because she changed so drastically.  Either that, or her repressed emotions after the deaths of her husband and her oldest son in the space of five years, led her to the bitter old woman she became.
