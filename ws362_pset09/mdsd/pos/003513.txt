Mark Gauvreau Judge has done a fine job of putting together the story of the Washington Senators in the 1920s and 1930s.  He has also, thankfully, shed some light on a very good player of that time, Joe Judge, his grandfather.  Through player development and some good trades, the Senators were built into an excellent team in the mid-20s, good enough to beat the Yankee (when they were bad in 1924) and when they were good in 1925.  They also beat back rugged competition from the Indians and the Tigers, who could hit but had pitching difficulties.  One of the more interesting aspects of that time was how close the players were back then, with general harmony in the Senator locker room.  A surprise in the book was what seemed to be a kind of bashing of Goose Goslin by the author; I always kind of liked Goose based on his interview in "The Glory of Their Times" and while I realize that he can have his moments like anyone else, there never really seemed to be anything good said about the man.  Be it a personal matter or my perception, it is a minor point to a book worth reading
