This book alone is very enlightening. In the first half of the book, you get a sense of Feynman's early beginnings and  how his fascination with science evolved. In his adolescent years, Feynman was influenced the most by his father. Although his father was not a professional scientist, he was stated as always having the right principle. In this autobiography Feynman recalls certain memories of his life, some not having anything to do with science whatsoever, but they all lead up to the investigation of the NASA shuttle the Challenger in the Part II. Feynman was appointed to the presidential commission that was in charge of figuring out why the dramatic and surprising crash of the shuttle occurred. There was no blatant evidence as to why the shuttle exploded, but Feynman had several ideas why it might have happened. He was presented with the idea that the solution to the problem lied in the O-rings in the rocket boosters. In this book he guides readers through his thought process and a first person description of his famous experiment with ice water and rubber clasps to prove his unbelievable theory. He proved that the O-rings do not work efficiently in cold temperature, specifically if it is 32 degrees or below. The temperature on the day of the launch was not in safe range. Feynman was right. His report was included in the appendix of the official document sent to the government stating the purpose of the crash. This report is also included in the book.  Many professionals in the science field doubted Feynman and his ideas. He was usually "brushed"  off and his opinions were never really taking into consideration during the public meetings of the commission. What readers will get out of this book is a true sense of how brilliant a man Richard Feynman was. He was truly an original and he wrote this book to show the public the way his mind works and how superficial people might be no matter how smart they are supposed to be.
