FOXFIRE by Joyce Carol Oates is a haunting tale of the relationships developed among groups of outcasts and "leftovers," marginalized by the established mainstream.  The subtitle is "Confessions of a Girl Gang," and that is exactly what is told.  The story is set in upstate New York but could be anywhere in American suburbia.  The group of girls gang together, at first out of circumstance, then survival, and finally love.  Despite the mostly pathetic personality of the characters, they become endearing and fit nicely into the world Oates has created.  I hesitate to recommend FOXFIRE to those unfamiliar with Oates' pastiche narrative style and penchant for (mostly mild) violence in her stories, but this did grip me and I considered it a "page turner."  

The movie version is only loosely based on the novel, with more differences than similarities.  Even with the successful cult following, which is at least partly due to Angelina Jolie's subsequent fame, the book outshines the movie's comparative mediocrity.
