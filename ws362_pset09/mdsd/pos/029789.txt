Miller exudes his passion for the game and his creative touch with it.  I really enjoy his uncanniness to give titles and such that add such fun to golf advocates, e.g. calling Seve "Golf's Greatest High-Wire Act" or likening playing Faldo to a python slowly squeezing the life out of its victim.

His passion pours forth in opinion after opinion about courses, players (notice Arnie not included), rules, junior golf, etc.  His concern over such as Tiger's swearing after a bad shot is admirable, and his overall enthusiasm for other players is refreshing.  

He was a terrific champion, and relates much of the foundation coming from his father, and his thoughts on parents applying it to their children.

A great read which is not diminished at all by a few overlooked editing mistakes
