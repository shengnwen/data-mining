It's the perfect calendar for people who love classic films, or appreciate the art of midcentury posters. I have beige cubicle walls at work, and this brightens up the space with its bold colors and great graphics. It also comes with a "bonus" - each month has a smaller movie poster image added to the page where dates are displayed, so you have the pleasure of seeing one large and one mini poster with every turn of the page
