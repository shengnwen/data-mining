Simple to read book explaining color management. If you're looking for a technical manual full of design specs, buy something else. If you're looking for an easy to read non-techy book that explains how human color vision works, how color management in the digital world is used and the how/why of applying it, buy this book. Given the low price used, it's a "must have" book for digital photographers. Once I read this, I finally understand what hundreds of technically written web sites failed to get across. I just thought I underastood what this book simply explains is normal plain english. Like I said, maybe a techy person would find this book wordy?
