Cynthia Rylant has once again distinguished herself as one of the world's premier writers for children. In her classic, A FINE WHITE DUST, Rylant skillfully delves into the soul of the misunderstood Pete. Rylant's use of the name &quot;Preacher Man&quot; allows the reader to identify with the wandering evangelist without being consumed by his charisma. And then there's Rufus! Who else but Rylant would be so bold to write about a youngster who claims to be a CONFIRMED ATHEIST? Pete's relationship with his parents, Rufus, and Preacher Man are beautifully crafted into a wonderful but heartbreaking story. Pete learns the hard way a basic fundamental truth that we all must learn sooner or later:People are not always what they seem. We read about a preacher who has flaws and feelings just like the rest of us. We learn that religion or lack thereof doesn't have to define our friendships. Every child should have the opportunity to read this touching story! Bravo to Rylant for daring to write about one of our so-called &quot;taboos!&quot
