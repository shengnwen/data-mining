My 16-month old would not sit still to read a book.  I have been trying for months.  I have to turn the pages very quickly and talk about the pictures so that we can complete them.  Once I showed him this book last week, he will sit and let me read the whole thing and then he likes to go back and re-read all of the pages and point to the balls for me to identify them.  
The flaps are a bit flimsy for his age-group.  But, if I help him, I know that they won't tear or bend
