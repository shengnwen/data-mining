Heir-apparent to the late Grover Krantz, Jeff Meldrum has become the main 'scientist' to support the existence of sasquatch. His expertise in the field of biometrics and locomotion is what interests him in the bigfoot phenomenon based on the tell-tale signs within purported authentic tracks. This book ties in with the "Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science" documentary (excellent in its own right) but is not a 'novelization' of the show as I half expected it to be. Instead we get a very interesting look into the limited scientific study that is going into sasquatch research. I also expected it to be too dry with a plethora of technical bone terminology but overall the book doesn't give off the overscience-y babble. This is an educated look into the field of bigfoot and is exceptionally well done (but then so is Daegling's 'Bigfoot Exposed', the other side of the coin).

The text is easy to read and quite interesting no matter where you stand on the subject matter. Of course I do have a few points against the book such as dependence on evidence put forth by Paul Freeman, a person that was not entirely trustworthy and purportedly fake many bigfoot related things, also wherever Freeman went - there was some sign of a bigfoot. There were two places in the book that did slow down but were interest holding enough to thoroughly read them.

Overall, possibly the best book released of late that supports the evidence for the creatures and done through 'scientific method'. But alas, until there's bones or a body, the matter will still be debated
