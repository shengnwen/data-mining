I read this book cover to cover and to be honest, I don't think I learned anything new. In fact there is surprisingly little time devoted to actually how/what to eat! It seems like most of the book is devoted to the idea that how you eat during pregnancy will affect your child's health later in life. So if you need motivation to reach for the veggies everyday, this would be a great book to read. But overall it's the same tips about what to avoid, eat from the food pyramid, etc. Having said that, I gave it four stars because even though the information isn't new, it feels good to get it from a reputable source since half the stuff you read, it's hard to tell if you can trust it. Additionally, there are some wonderful, easy, healthy recipes at the end of the book
