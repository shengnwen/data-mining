I had only bought this book for a course in university but we only had to do the first five chapters. I had to go on with it though. The cases are all extremely well written and did an amazing job of showing me how insane the corporate world can be. It's a great book if you're looking for something to change your perspectives on the ethics of todays business society and the major differences between "white collar" and traditional crimes
