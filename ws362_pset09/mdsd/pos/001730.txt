This is by far one of, if not the best book on dealing with fibroids naturally...the list is endless(and sometimes confusing) about herbal teas and vitamins...but definitely an eye opener in the world of choices..for those of us women who want surgery as an absolute last resort, and who want to shrink or stop growth or even prevent reoccurence of fibroids..this book details not only with holistic and natural approaches to dealing with fibroids, it also gets to the root of the problem, liver detox, hormone imbalance, ect..and explains how surgery is not always the answer as even after surgery fibroids can return...Dr. Warshowsky gets to the nitty gritty as to why the system(organs) are off balance as to create these little buggers in the first place...not saying this will be the cure for all but look into it and try some of these natural healing ways..
