I have not finished reading this book yet, so I can't comment on the ending, but I am so fascinated by Atwoods writing that I simply can't wait to review it... . I decided to give this book a 4 star rating.   Why ? Because the characters are real.  Allthough it seems easy to write about real people, Atwood prooves clearly that it is not.  To write with such accuracy and nuance, one needs a  thorough psychological insight.  I could find no clichés in this book, only a description of real, unpredictable, complex human beings in constant interaction with a lot of things: other people, themselves, images of the past, wishes for the future, and so on... .  Because of this the reader can recognise parts of each character , not only in himself but also in others.  This is a quality I value greatly in books. The last time I read a novel with the same level of human insight was with Peter Careys 'Oscar and Lucinda', although Atwood beats Carey as far as the realistic story is concerned. Why not 5 stars then ?  I had some trouble picking this book up for the first 30 pages or so.  Perhaps this was due to the gloominess of the story, perhaps it had to do with the English vocabulary I don't master as well as I wish I would.  Also, the story didn't really appeal to me at first, I found it hard keeping on track with the constant changement in perspective.  On the other hand, once I got through the first part, these changes of perspective started fascinating me very much. In short: I recommend this book to everyone who likes a  good psychological novel.  Dragging yourself trough the first pages is certainly worth the bother
