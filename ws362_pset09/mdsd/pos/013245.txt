Overall I'm quite satisfied with this book.  I like the way the author compares working in Photoshop with the way Ansel Adams worked in the darkroom.  I had always considered 'Photoshopping' a picture in a negative light, and the descriptions and examples in this book completely changed my opinion.  The techniques described are really nothing more than the digital equivalent of what master photographers have done with film for years.  The book has excellent examples of how to get the most out of any digital image
