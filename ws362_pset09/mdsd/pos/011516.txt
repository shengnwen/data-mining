very good book.. great pictures.. fun excercises that are alot harder than they look.. easy to follow along.. however, if you're looking for something to get your heart rate up, this doesn't always work.. i usually combine it with practicing dance and do this as a warm up and cool down.. very relaxing.. definately makes you feel elongiated (is that a word?).. i enjoyed it alot.
