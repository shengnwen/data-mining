This book is really awesome. It has a super-light text and very beautiful drawings and sketches. I just love Looney Tunes since I was a kid.

But be warned: this book is not another Animator's Survival Kit. It  is, really, for kids. The coolest thing in the book are the characters charts. Tons of info on how to draw your favorite Looney Tunes characters
