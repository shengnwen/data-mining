I enjoyed this book more than Max Allen Collin's second Dark Angel novel 'Skin Game', as I found Max's backstory quite interesting and informative. 

However I don't feel he's really got her character down pat, and there were certain elements to the story which I found difficult to chew. Such as the transgenic Seth, who also escaped from Manticore in '09 and winds up working for Eyes Only. Seth is never mentioned in the show or even counted amid the 12 escapees (turns out that he's the 13th) and personally, I find this transgenic a hard bit of 'canon' to swallow. It just doesn't tie in with what we know of the characters in the show. Would Logan really have kept Seth a secret from Max? Maybe so, but it makes him now seem incredibly ruthless.  I'm not the biggest fan of Logan but I still find it hard to believe he could do what he does to Seth, and still be able to 'use' Max once she comes along.  Actually, maybe he could... *shrugs*

Anyway, asides from that gripe I did find this book a good read. At times even a great read.  Although I still feel Max Allen Collins was the wrong writer for the job. 
I've read better fan fiction
