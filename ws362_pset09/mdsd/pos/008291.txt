These days, most war stories are from World War II, or the Holocaust. With many survivors and many horrific stories to tell, hundreds of books have been written on the topic and read by the public. "All Quiet on the Western Front" is a story about the "other" war, though, granted, it was written before WWII.

The book tells of Paul Baumer, a young man enlisted in the German army. Fresh out of school, Paul was encouraged by his teacher to enlist, and what he had thought would be a noble, beautiful thing turned out to be an ugly, frightening brush with death. As one by one he loses his friends and companians, and finds himself in various life-and-death situation, his views start to change, and he grows up.

Parts of the book are beautifully described and wonderfully easy to visualize. Everything seems so real. The writing about the war is very accurate, and very realistic. Remarque describes going over the top and fighting to such an extent that it is even frightening, and you know that someone (or several someones) will have died in the battle. 

There are, however, parts of the book that lag excessively. Sometimes there would be pages and pages of almost identical descriptions, or dull, pointless side stories that had nothing to do with character developement or the story itself. The beginning of the book is also rather boring, but that, thankfully enough, gets solved not much farther in.

All in all, a good book, even for those who are merely required to read it for English class. Though it can get boring and tedius at times, it's important to read, both for the psychological aspect as well as the historical side
