The best 122 pages you will ever read to inspire enlighten and give understanding to an artist life.  Not a text book on how to create art or a highbrow telling you what is and is not art.  Just pure down to earth truth of what an artist life is like.  I read this book in three days between classes and working 40 hour week.  As and artist reading Art & Fear I found my self speaking out loud in agreement with the text, which was some what funny in a public place.  Anyway read it if you are an artist or know an artist or just want to know more about artist life.   After I read Art & Fear I wrote this "When I in my studio and my work is following, the world is at peace, time falls away, heaven and hell are at my command until hunger and sleep over take me, then reality comes back"  from William Mizell. And that how it feels
