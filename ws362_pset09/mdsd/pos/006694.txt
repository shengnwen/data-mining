This is an excellent book on true team building. I have been a part of ropes courses and other team building activities. In my opinion, they are lots of fun, but in the end do little to actually build team. This book gives a practical and accessible guide for being able to build effective teams, and teams that work within the unique structure of the organization that you might be in. Principled and not necessarily prescriptive, there are many concepts and ideas that can be gleaned to make more effective teams within your organization. I also enjoyed the story style of presenting the concepts as they gave a real world environment in which to see the concepts played out. Excellent resource
