In search of a challenging read, and intrigued by the Italian locale of much of the story, I picked up this 500+ page book at the library one day during lunch.  Styron's vocabulary is immense, and his prose is quite enjoyable to read.  The 1st part of the book is pretty absorbing, but the middle part is so slow and drawn out that it makes getting to the fairly interesting end rather tedious.  The main problem I had was the inordinate focus on Cass' recollections.  His recollections of North Carolina and the South I liked, but Cass' actions are not particulary considerate towards his family, and he is not an especially sympathetic character (esp. given his own self-destructive tendencies).  I did not view Mason as some kind of evil incarnate, and ultimately the character of Leverett is not developed and fades into the background.  Finally, given the book came out in 1960, some of the cultural differences and clashes brought out in the book (e.g. Mason talking about the Beats) seem a little dated.  Nevertheless, the European setting and exquisite writing style compelled me to see the book to its (largely satisfactory) ending.  If you have the time, and patience, this book may well be worth your while
