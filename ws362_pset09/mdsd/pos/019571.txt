This book was so exciting and just another wonderful work of children's literature by Dahl.  This is the third Dahl book that my 5-year-old and I have read over the course of the past year, and all of them were hard for both of us to put down.  The fox is truly fantastic and is a hero to his family and the other "digger" animals around him.  He outwits three farmers and prevails with his cleverness.  The underground adventure that the fox takes us on keeps us on the edge of our seat.  What a great story for children
