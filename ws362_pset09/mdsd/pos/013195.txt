Alanna Nash let the tape roll on three members of the "Memphis Mafia," the coterie of friends and relations that were closest to the King of Rock n Roll.  There are a number of other recollections from family and friends as well, which blows the lid off the real life of Elvis, and what he turned into.

The stories seem a bit disjointed as the boys think back, but Nash has done well to assemble them and take us through a timeline of Elvis' early life, his career false starts, the rocket ride to superstardom and the tragic crash landing.

Elvis was indeed a talent, a great singer and performer and was indeed one of the pioneers of rock.  Unfortunately he was also all too human;  a small town Mississippi boy who never got rid of some of his prejudices, his love of southern food (and its odd combinations), his spiritual quest, and his descent into drug abuse.

Elvis like many great artists was an addictive personality--when he was into something, he threw himself into it, good and bad.  The insiders followed Elvis through his varied vices (many wondering how they lived through it), and all the other things.

There were indeed moments of great generosity and giving, but Elvis could also be notoriously mean, controlling, and violent.  His shooting out televisions was nothing, as readers will find.

Priscilla does not come off well;  she is depicted as an ambitious, conniving creature who cared little for Elvis, but lusted after his money and anything else she could get out of him.  Many relatives sponged off him, too, as did Colonel Tom Parker, the manager who enriched himself with what seems to be little caring for Presley's addictions and downward spiral.

The highs and lows are all here;  believe it or not, the stories tend to ring true of many who achieve stardom and are not ready to deal with it
