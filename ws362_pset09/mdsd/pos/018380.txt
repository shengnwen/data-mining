Having purchased this book based upon an Amazon rec, I spent the first chapter cursing Meghan Daum and Jeff Bezos.  It was EXCRUTIATINGLY true of everything I know about young adult life in New York City, and I hated having it served up to me in such precise, laboriously correct fashion.  However, I persisted, and was ultimately rewarded by much of what I read...finally succumbing altogether when I reached the "Music is My Bag" segment; as one bearing the viciously peculiar scars of an adolescent oboe experience, I laughed OUT LOUD during a morning rush-hour train ride, and forgave everything remotely unsatisfying that had come before.  Anyone who has ever had the burden of Eccentricity as Excellence imposed by a parent, for whatever reason, will both cringe and rejoice at this INCREDIBLY detailed accounting of what it costs to be too smart and unique for the flute (or its functional equivalent--name the field).  Congratulations, Meghan:  You finally put down that heinous 'horn' and its attendant reed making, as did I, and never looked back.  I fantasize that someday I'll have the privilege of recounting "The Horror of Interlochen (Michigan) All-State Orchestra 1979" to you over coffee...I thank you for giving voice to every over-achiever who's ever questioned the mission we were unwittingly assigned, and found the courage to defy the twin tyrannies of conformity AND its evil twin, The Subculture of Bagdom.
