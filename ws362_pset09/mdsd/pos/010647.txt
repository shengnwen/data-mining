I was surprised that I enjoyed this book. After the first few lines I though Uh-oh... Jungian dream analysis and fake native mysticism... this is going to be so pretentious I won't be able to stomach it. But, I kept reading - and reading - and reading. This is no simple biography. Nor is it mere navel gazing from an overindulged artist. It is most of all a love story between a man and a woman, woman and creation and the creator for the created. It was enormously interesting to watch the growth of an artist from first fumblings with technique and culture to a mastery of both the art form and the marriage between myth and creation (both art and ourselves). Somewhere along the way the craft of weaving became the art of creation and we are the lucky few who get to witness the process.

I learned about myth, culture, mathematics, art, discipline, color and form. I suspect I will never be able to create anything again without at least once mentally refering back to this book - even though weaving is not my chosen medium. The design process through reflection after completion is shown so clearly that It will influence me for a very long time
