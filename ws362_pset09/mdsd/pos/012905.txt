Dreamland is about Caitlin and her sister Cass runs away and Caitlin was always in her shadow. Cass runs away and Caitlin becomes a cheerleader which she doesn't want to be one. She falls in love with Rogerson and he ends up beating her up. I loved this story. I could see a little of my past relationship in Caitlin and Rogerson, (my ex never beat me) and I know how she felt. It is a wonderful story
