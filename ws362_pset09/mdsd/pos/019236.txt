I am studying robotics. I find this book very useful.

Chapter 6: "Kane's Method in Robotics" introduces KANE method to drive dynamics equations for robotics in detail with example.

Other chapters are well written with C source code. I have not tested these code carefully.

Highly recommend for grad students those have read "Introduction to Robotics" of John Craig, "Dynamics: Theory and Applications" of Thomas R. Kane and David. A Levison
