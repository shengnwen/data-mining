Prince Carrick of the fae (farries) is cursed to live without his ladylove, the human Lady Gwen, until three people can fall in love.

The first is Aidan Gallagher, owner and operator of the local family pub, and keeper of his artistic absent-minded brother, and lovably shallow sister.

Jude Francis is an American ex-psych professor who wants to write a book on Irish fairy tales. She moves into her grandmother's cottage, the very one Lady Gwen dwelled in, and where her ghost still haunts.

Aidan is a very fatherly character but still tall, dark, and sexy. Jude was hard for me to relate to (I read this when I was only 20) as she's a little older than most romance heroines (other ones about her age and maturity are usually widows falling for their husband's best friend).

Roberts creates very believable sexual tension without blinding conflict, just uses human frailties to keep you guessing about the fate of Aidan and Jude, and she interweaves a masterful tale of Carrick and Gwen. The secondary characters are rich, the scenery beautiful, and the set up for the next two in the series (Tears of the Moon, Heart of the Sea) excellent.

A sure fire page turner for every romance fan, and another smooth tale for Nora Roberts' fans
