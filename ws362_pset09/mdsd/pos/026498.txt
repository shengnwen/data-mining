Steve is a sixteen-year-old black kid who is on trial for his life.  He has been implicated in a robbery that went bad.  The owner of a drug store is now dead, killed with his own gun that he had for protection against robbery.  Other people who were involved in the robbery have agreed to testify against Steve in exchange for a lighter sentence.

The prosecution lawyer is calling Steve a monster.  His family doesn't seem to know what to say to him and may even believe that he is guilty of this horrible crime.  Prison is absolutely terrifying, with people wanting to hurt each other all of the time.  The case against him seems pretty weak, but will the jury believe Steve's claim that he wasn't involved in the robbery?

The style of this book is really interesting.  I like how Steve's personality comes through, and I like how he tries to make his script brutally honest.  I also like that Steve never says what part he really played in the robbery.  

The whole tone of the book was very sad, though.  Steve seems stuck in a desperate situation and he knows he can't do anything about it.  I felt so sorry for him as I read this book
