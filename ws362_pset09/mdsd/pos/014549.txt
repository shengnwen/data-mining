Clement Moore's "Night Before Christmas" gets an almost origami pop-up treatment engineered to be as sophisticated as it is adorable.  Magically designed, value-priced and thoughtfully executed it is sturdy but it really is "art" and not for very young children without supervision.

One of the best Christmas gifts for '04.
