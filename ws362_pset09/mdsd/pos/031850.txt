A really great book, and a great explanation as to why these ideas (from Buddha, Jesus, Moses) are so important to our lives.  Though technology has reshaped our physical lives, human nature has not changed, and we still have the same basic desires.
I had the opportunity to meet the author and speak with him (and to thank him for writing this book), and was thoroughly impressed by his scope of knowledge on these subjects.
This is the best book I have read in years, and has significantly altered how I look at my own life (a wake-up call you could say), and has allowed me to better understand the shortfalls of modern culture.  It has helped reignite and reinvigorate my interest in religion, and I am grateful for having read it in a thorough and focused (though we can all be more focused) manner
