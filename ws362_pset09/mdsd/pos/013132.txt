I read it at least once a year.  I love the story, the atmosphere, and the characters--including Andrea, the main character.  Many reviewers here have found her off-putting, and she certainly is at first.  She's selfish, opinionated and abrasive, not to put too fine a point on it.  But she evolves.  The sharp tongue doesn't completely go away, but she softens--love for Martin softens her, and although she doesn't submit to it willingly, it happens all the same.  There's a haunting incident at the end in which she recognizes and repudiates the way she's tried to control Jim (her brother), has tried to clip his wings, metaphorically speaking.  It sickens her, and she draws back from it.  Her personal growth is one of the reasons I like this book so much
