   Regrettably, I have not yet read this book as I have been too busy taking pictures. My photographs illustrate the cover and year dividers so I feel like I was as much a part of the production of this volume as was Ed Bearss.  It took a long time to get this volume out, but in the final analysis I like the way the book looks. My pictures in this book show only a few of the battlefields I have shot but these images are among my favorites.
