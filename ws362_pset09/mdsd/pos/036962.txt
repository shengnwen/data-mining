I decided to start reading as many baseball autobiographies as I could. In the book store I stumbled upon this book, hearing so much about it before. I got it right away even though it was a first edition and read it. While many think of Cobb as a horrible bigot, he did have some good excuses for his actions. Everyone is supposed to fluff up their lives when writing and Cobb did just that. However I thought that it was very informative and it gave a real slice of life from baseball when he was playing. He gives his opinions on players and gives tips on what "young men" should do to make the big leagues. I loved the book and it gave me quite a good idea of what the players might have actually been like. So...GO COBB!!
