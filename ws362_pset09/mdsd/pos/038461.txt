Fantastic!

After finishing reading the first two chapters, I already made up my view on this novel, which is quite consistent till the end of it (1000+ pages).  It was tough read, unless a reader has set his/her mind on finishing them all.

If you think you know about the history of England, then you should grab and read this novel.  The main events really happened (a fact), while Rutherfurd has skilfully put life into the facts by re-living the characters.  I have also never knew that England used to be a cape jutting out from the northwestern part of France in the past 10,000 years, which is quite recent by geological standards.  Before that, England was still a cape.

Each chapter was dedicated by the author to a certain period of time during the English history: neolithical times, stonehenge period, Celtic culture introduction, Roman invasions, Saxon culture intrusion, Norman conquest, the plague, and so on.  A the result of the breadth of subjects exposed, the author cannot dwell into details on each historical events, otherwise it will become a encyclopedia of English history written in fiction terms.  This, I suspect, was one of the flaw which many readers finally gave a 4-star review.

Anyway, I respect Mr. Rutherfurd's effort in condensing such a broad subject into just a little over a thousand pages of novel.  A five-star read for me
