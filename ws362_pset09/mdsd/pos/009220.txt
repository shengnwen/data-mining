The book is about a girl named Hilary, who is a neo-Nazi, which gets in a motorcycle accident and goes into a coma. In a coma she slips into a dream of someone else's life. The some one else is her hospital roommates life, hr name was Chana. Hilary saw into Chana's past, which was when Chana was a young woman who lived through the Nazi reign of terror and survived. Throughout the whole book you se through Chana's and Hilary's eyes.

	In my opinion the author did a good job making the book a page turner because of the conflicts and dramatic situations that occur throughout the story. It was very compelling and was able to draw readers of both genders, and all ages, into the book. The author uses a creative narration style. She goes from Hilary's mind set to Chana's. It is a good way to narrate the book with both stories going on at the same time. I was able to relate to some of the feelings that both Chana and Hilary felt during the book. With Hilary it was her hate and annoyance with her mother that I think I could relate with the most. I could relate to Chana when she goes through not understanding of why something is happening to her when she did not do anything wrong and she felt hatred towards god because of what was happening to her and her family. I think that if I had to give the book a rating on a scale of one-to-ten I would give it eight and a half because the beginning was a bit confusing when you are first introduced to the characters and all that is going on to them. The middle of the book was also a bit boring because the surroundings in the book don't change quite as often as they did in the beginning and the same thing happens to Chana day after day. I really recommend reading this book because it gives you both point of views, one of a modern day neo-Nazi and also what it would feel like to live through Hitler's reign of terror.
