The Longest Journey can be difficult to get into, but is worth the effort.  Set at the end of the Victorian period in England, it follows the character  of Rickie Elliot from his Cambridge days through various attempts to find  happiness and fulfillment in life. It helps to know a little about British  society to fully understand each character's actions. The fascinating thing  about the novel is that there isn't a single character that you can  pinpoint as good or bad -- like real people, the characters lie and put on  false fronts. It's fun to discover just who Rickie's friends and relatives  really are. Characters like Agnes, who Rickie loves, and Mrs. Failing, his  relative, make some great points about women in society. Although this book  is primarily a &quot;novel of manners&quot; like Jane Austen would write,  there are several exciting plot twists, including a surprise ending.
