Excllent book; I've read a lot about the French Revolution and there were facts here I'd never read before, or that had never been emphasized in other books. The only reason I do not give it five stars is that the author fell for that old urban legend about Marie Antoinette's hair going white from fright during her flight to Varennes: I'm surprised that a historian would repeat that old canard as if it were true (or even possible). Other than that caveat, I highly recommend this book.
