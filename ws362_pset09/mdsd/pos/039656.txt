I wish I could give this book 10 stars instead of 5. What an awesome follow up to his first book, River Town!!!  Having been a teacher in China, done business there and lived in China for as long as Hessler did, I can say that this book is the best I've read (and I've read a lot on China) on contemporary China - he really catches both the real China and what it is like to be a foreigner in China and the reverse culture shock one feels when coming back to America post- 9/11 (feeling like there is a 'hole in my nation's history' and how the more similar China and America were becoming with their double speak - 'Motherland' and 'Homeland').  I kept on saying to myself as I did when I read 'River Town' that this is EXACLTY what I experienced (the special English, living in China during the Belgrade bombing) or this is exactly what my students or my friends said or felt (their feelings about 9/11 or their reluctance in talking about the past and their focus on the future).  

He also did a great job of putting his true feelings into the book ( and with humor)- the love/hate relationship towards China, the fascinationn and at the same time the frustration towards the place and the people. It makes me want to go back there and live once again with it's warts and all.
   
I think that those who just read some of the negative reviews on this site and not buy the book because of them will be missing out on a lot.  Maybe for some the book is too negative or doesn't paint the romantic picture people imagine of China or doesn't portray Chinese as communist hating people who are constantly trying to overthrow their government.  But it portrays the true China and the true experience of living in such a constantly changing place.  And he does it with humor and irony.
