This is one of PKD's more obscure titles, and in some ways, this status is warranted.  Of all Dick's novels, I found Galactic Pot-Healer to be the most unconstrained and it is certainly not for the uninitiated.  Even though I've read almost all of his other works, the convoluted plot and the always transient identity of the Glimmung was very confusing.  But, as Dick's career attests to, just because it's unconventional doesn't mean it can't be successful in a quirky sort of way.  And I think because of this, Pot-Healer is one of Dick's funniest books.  I just love the part where Joe is trapped in the box and calls in to the radio talk show, asking where he is.  But the focus of the book is a very serious exploration of metaphysical interplay between the Glimmung and his (her?) antithesis the Black Glimmung.  Strangely, there was something about Joe's investigation that I found terrifying.  Even more than The Game Players of Titan, the paranoia is tangible and omnipresent, and it makes Pot-Healer a very dark book.  It is NOT light metaphysical comedy, and Dick never provides the reader with sure footing or any character that can truly be trusted.  I recommend checking out a few of the more straightforward PKD books (The Man in the High Castle, Now Wait for Last Year) before reading this, because, though it is one of his shorter works, it can be daunting for someone unacquainted with PKD
