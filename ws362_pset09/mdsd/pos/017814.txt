Suttree is an extremely challenging book.  I picked it up, read the first thirty or so pages, then put it down for two years before I finally dedicated myself to reading the whole thing.  The narrative occurs in elliptic little episodes, with no particular overarching plot.  Many reviewers here have cited this as a flaw, but McCarthy is breaking the ordinary traditions of narrative here for a reason - a life does not progress in neat order, nor do most people live to see some golden denouement that makes sense of all their previous decisions.  Suttree the character lives without this happy sense of order, and McCarthy has no desire to provide it to the reader.  As in life, some things happen, some more things happen, and then the story ends.  In the hands of a less skillful writer this could have been an appalling mess, but McCarthy's incredible gifts make it at once satisfying and heartbreakingly incomplete
