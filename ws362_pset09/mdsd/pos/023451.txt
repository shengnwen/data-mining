All these negative reviews by americans about one of the bad guys of the book need to get over it. i am an American myself and i love my country but for crying out loud it was a book and a fictional book at that. also lets be perfectly honest like the United States government would not do anything in its power if it had the chance to have total control of earth for a thousand years. we both know they would jump on that opportunity and probably would do a lot of the things that the book talked about. so its not an unrealistic assumption to write baout these thing
