I've read this series in order from the start and I have to say the first several books were pretty lacking and very dated but, I kept going and I'm glad I did. Starting with Night Probe (sixth in the series), the stories, writing, and characters, just get better and better. Cussler's writing was always more plain fun rather than classic literature but, his style has simply improved with each book.
So, we reach Dragon and it's quite the ride. The first hundred pages or so has aerial fights, lost atomic bombs, a nuclear explosion, an undersea base, and two undersea rescues. Far fetched? Unbelivable? Of course, it is. It's also the most fun you'll have "watching" some of the best action since Indiana Jones in Raiders. The whole book moves along at a near breathless pace and it's hard to find a dull moment. Some reviewers have said there are a bit too many anti-Japanese remarks and I have to agree but, in Cussler's defense I think this was suppose to focus on the ultra-fundalmentalist villian and his underworld connections more than Japanese society at large.
Regardless of this debate, the book is a swift, fun, action packed read that will have you ready to move on to the next Dirk Pitt adventure , Sahara. Kick back and enjoy.
