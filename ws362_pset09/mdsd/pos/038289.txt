If you want one lush, visually opulant but also well-researched book on  the Greene brothers and their unique accomplishments in the arts &amp;  crafts style, and money is no object, this is the one to get.  If it IS an  object, Makinson's earlier, smaller paperback, Greene and Greene:  Architecture As A Fine Art, will do nicely as a overview of their  residential architecture career, but be warned----eventually you'll  probably want color photographs.  If you've ever visited one of their  remaining houses that are open to the public, you know that the color  tonalities of the rooms are a considerable part of their charm, and you've  probably already bought this book.  If you havn't, don't wait 'til it goes  out of print.  This is THE Greene and Greene book, coffee table or  otherwise
