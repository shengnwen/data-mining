I loved this book and read it a few hours.  It gives a very quick biography or a dozen or so female pirates throughout history, accompanied with some great, colorful illustrations. I really like the pictures. It is not a serious or scholary book on the subject, but rather a fun and campy look at a bit of history.  I'm not so sure how accurate the accounts are, but it is an entertaining read none the less.  I would recommend this book for highschoolers as a way to introduce them to and spark some interest in interesting characters from the past.  The author includes a list of further reading at the end of the book if you find your are further interested in reading up on pirates
