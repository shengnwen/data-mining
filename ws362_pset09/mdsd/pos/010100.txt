Okay, it's a collection of Far Side comics, which is what I want, so it's awesome for that reason.  BUT, the actual final product in book form is a little disappointing.  First, all the comics are black and white.  Yeah, it's not about the art and you don't miss much without color, but come on, would a little color kill anyone (especially ones that were originally color)?  Second, it's pretty thin on strips, with 4 to a page most of the time (a good amount) sometimes 2 on a page, and even occassionally one comic on a single page!  It looks pretty silly with just one giant comic on a page.
