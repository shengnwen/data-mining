Have you been bombarded with news about the terrorist attacks on Israel?  If so, what viewpoint do you get to see?  Perhaps sympathetic stories about the terrorists and their families?  Along with explanations that the main problem is "Israeli greed?"   And Israel's "illegal theft of Arab land?"  And the horror of Israel permitting Jews to live in Judea?

If so, then I think this book is for you.  Its many essays tell, in dramatic style, how things look from an Israeli perspective.  There are a wide variety of articles about the effect of all this terror on Israel and Israelis.  Some of the essays that impressed me the most were written by Tuvia Grossman, Sherri Mandell, Elie Weisel, Natan Sharansky, Sue Tedmon, Laurie Zoloth, Efraim Karsh, Israel Asper, Jeff Jacoby, Dore Gold, and Ephraim Shore.  Near the end of the book, there is also an excellent article called "Fifty-five Ways to Help Israel." 

I recommend the entire book, and I think aish.com and the editors (Nechemia Coopersmith and Shraga Simmons) deserve plenty of compliments for their fine work
