Now in it's sixth edition, this book has become the standard text on the design and construction of buildings made of wood. While most wooden structures are residences, the book also covers multi story wooden structures such as apartment houses, commercial buildings with wooden roofs, and to a limited extent newer techniques such as glue-laminate beams.

The book is suitable for use either as a text for a course or as a reference for self study. The sixth edition of this book was promoted by five major developments:

1. Publication of new dual-format (ASD/LRFD) wood design criteria in the 2005 National Design Specification for Wood Construction. 

2. Publication of the new Special Design Provisions for Wind and Seismic (SDPWS) Supplement to the NDS. 

3. Publication of the comprehensive ASD/LRFD Manual for Engineered Wood Construction. 

4. Publication and increased adoption nationally of the 2006 International Building Code. ==5. Publication of updated load standards in the 2005 edition of Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures
