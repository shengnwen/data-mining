Sir John Gielgud must have one of the most well-trained, beautiful voices of any modern actor. His reading of passages from the world's greatest playwright (greatest author? greatest artist?) is a treat, one I've enjoyed  over a dozen times without beginning to tire of. Although Gielgud is simply  reading his favorite passages and sonnets with only minimal (and rather  lame) introductions and transtitions, the greatness of the material still  shines through. The lines alternately exude bitter sadness, biting humor,  intense excitement, and always an unmatched understanding of what it means  to be human. I'm glad that there are several passages from HAMLET, my  favorite play, but less familiar passages are equally memorable--Clarence's  recounting of a horrible dream foreshadowing his imminent death from  RICHARD III, Leontes's bitterly jealous rant from WINTER'S TALE, Cassius's  magnificent denunciation of Caesar from JULIUS CAESAR, and Prospero's  renunciation of his magic from THE TEMPEST. The last passage works on  several levels--as the resolution of the play of course, as Shakespeare's  symbolic farewell to the &quot;rough magic&quot; of writing, and as a great  actor's triumphant goodbye to the stage. Listening to Gielgud deliver these  speeches is as close as we will likely ever come to hearing the words of  the bard as they should be delivered, I can't recommend this tape too  highly
