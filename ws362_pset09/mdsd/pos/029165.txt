an amazing book, thoughtfully and articulately written, and filled with inspiration, wisdom, and depth. once i started it, i couldn't put it down. i recommend it to anyone - independent of your spiritual/religious leanings. it's the kind of book i'll (hope to) read 10 times, and continue to peruse over the years,  because the lessons for life are enduring
