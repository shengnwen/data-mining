Night Gallery was on when I was ten years old. It scared and delighted me at the same time. Later I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel. This was not the Night Gallery I remember. A very good friend of mine sent me the entire 2nd and third season on DVD, uncut.(I bought season 1 right here on Amazon). Here was Night Gallery again! This book is the definitive version of the story behind this wonderful television series,and it is the perfect companion to the show. I will go out on a limb here and say that Night Gallery (seasons 1 & 2) compares to and even excels Twilight Zone. A must read for anyone intersested in this very unique television show.
