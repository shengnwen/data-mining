I read Practicing Radical Honesty after first reading Brad Blanton's  popular &quot;Radical Honesty&quot;. I expected it to be more of the same.  Well, I should have known better. Brad connects with the previous book and  then takes off beyond individuality, through community, even beyond our  current existence. I found his style strightforward and clear. The content  covered the &quot;Great Work&quot; - as told by Gurdjieff, Erhard and many  others. I love his straightforward approach in explaining the synthesis of  these formerly hidden ideas for every day use. I have no doubt that if you  put Brad's ideas into practice,using his &quot;Workbook for Life  Design&quot; chapter in the book, you will be clearer about your life's  purpose and meaning
