The amount of research that has gone into this book is astounding. It seem as though every hour of Mao's life has been covered. If there was ever to be a concise book on Mao's life then this is it. If you haven't studied into the subject of Mao Tse-tung, then I suggest that you start from this book, everything else seems supplementary.  
I have read a few reviews that have stated the book is biased and is aimed at only demonizing Mao. Though this may be the case, I doubt the atrocities that Mao committed could ever be exaggerated. It always pays to keep your mind open to different interpretations, but overall everything has come from witnesses, not from the author's imaginations.

Excellent book, highly recommended.
