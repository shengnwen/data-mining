The best book on food, eating, etc, I have ever read. There are 18 chapters on 18 different subjects, ranging from tomatoes to ham to coffee to salmon. Each one gives a concise history of the subject, how it came to its modern form, what the best types are and how to order them (or grow them yourself and order the seeds, as appropriate), what the flavor components are, etc. For even a half-hearted gardener, just the chapter on tomatoes is worth the price of the book. This is a book that a foodie will deeply appreciate and re-read often, but even folks who don't take their food that seriously will like it, too.
