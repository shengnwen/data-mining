I have a long ride to work (an hour each way) and have started reading books on tape.  The adult section got boring, so I started looking in the kids section.  I stumbled across this story and fell in love with it.  I agree with a previous reviewer that it's probably best for 8 and up...the horse's death was pretty harsh.  It is based on Grimm after all.
Overall, great characters and story, I highly recommend it.  I'm definately looking for her other books now :
