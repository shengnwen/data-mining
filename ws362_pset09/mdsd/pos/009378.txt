This wonderful book used to consist of four smaller books describing the life of a tribe of early humans. I was lucky enough to come across a battered copy of Nora's tale in a used book store. After reading it I knew I had to get the other three books. The books were long out of print and I was unable to obtain any others until now. After rereading Nora's tale countless times, I was overjoyed to find a complete collection of the books in print. I was delighted with the story line which is an original historical fiction with a hint of fantasy. However, this book is by far Peter Dickinson's best. I was ghastly disappointed with all of his others
