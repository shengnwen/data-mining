To me, one of the biggest disappointments of 20th century American literature is the size of the Dashiell Hammett oeuvre. The saying goes, "Write what you know", and Hammett certainly knew his subject. He didn't have to be a former Pinkerton man to create his characters, but it probably didn't hurt.

Sadly, Hammett only wrote a few novels-- but "The Maltese Falcon" reveals him at the height of his powers. It's clean, concise, and intelligent. I've read the Hemingway library and I've read the Hammett library. "The Maltese Falcon" is as good as anything Hemingway ever wrote. It still jumps off the page. 

Just don't expect the closing line from the movie-- that came after
