Stories, Inspiration and Pragmatism...  The laws of success consolidated into a pretty thick book.  It's not the type of book that you just can't put down.  It's the type of book that you can't afford to not pick up.  Use this as a handbook, not a weekend read. Use this as a daily devotional, not a vacation enhancement.  That's my piece.
