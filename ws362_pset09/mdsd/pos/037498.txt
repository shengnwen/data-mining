I haven't read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women but I recently listened to the audiobook recording which was read by Jamie Lee Curtis and I thought it was a very good story and I liked the characters, especially Jo, Marmee and Laurie. Jamie Lee Curtis gave a wonderful reading performance and I would have liked it if this had been an unabridged audiobook intstead of just abridged but unfortunately she only recorded an abridged version but anyway I highly recommend this audiobook and I will have to look for the paperback book too
