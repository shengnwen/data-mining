Ok, yes, this isn't the next great American novel.  However this book is a great chick-lit to read when you're missing your best friend or if you just want to live the virtual life of someone on the NYC social scene.  Similar, yes, to The Devils Wears Prada but different enough to not have you guessing every beat of the book.

A worthy read for all fans of chick lit but if Hawthorne is your favorite writer you may want to pass
