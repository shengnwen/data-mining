Curiously, my local bookshop stocks this wonderful book in the &quot;Travel&quot; section. From the cover with the inverted Eiffel Tower to the hilarious &quot;hotel features&quot; icons, even the least adventurous armchair traveller can deduce that this is indeed a unique  tourist guide. It is a guide of sorts: taking the Parisians on at their own  game it transforms a city known for its absurdities into a whimsical  looking-glass world where nothing is as it seems. Bantock's incredible  illustrations and the feast of found images adorn the author's intoxicating  prose. She lets us peek at the acidic comments written in the guestbooks of  fictional hotels. Her cafes reek of gitanes and hallucinogenic  pseudo-reality.  Paris Out of Hand is a one-off classic, and my only  complaint is that the type fades far too quickly from the cover with the  inevitable constant handling. I've bought several copies and given them all  away as gifts. Now I'm getting one for myself
