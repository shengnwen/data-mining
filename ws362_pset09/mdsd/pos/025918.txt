     At first glance the Battaglia's marriage seemed like the stuff movies were made of. By the time their relationship was over a movie could be made out of their story, but that movie would be one of great sorrow. Mary met and married a guy whom she thought was so great, if she had only known about his past a little more she would have realized that he had a history of violence in his first marriage. When things went wrong between John and Mary, she learned first hand how out of control things could get so fast. In the end, their daughters were the ones who suffered the most. The crime committed towards Faith and Liberty Battaglia by their father, the person who was supposed to protect them from harm, makes me sick to my stomach.  John Battaglia found the ultimate punishment for his second wife.  He knew that by murdering his two daughters while their mother listened over the phone would devastate her more than anything in the world.  When John realized that he was going to be arrested for beating his ex-wife, he wasn't going to go down with out consequences towards Mary for reporting him to the authorities.
    
 This book made me realize that in an instant things can go incredibly wrong. I believe everyone should read this book because we can all learn from this lady's mistakes. All along she tried to get along with her ex-husband because she believed if she acted civil towards him he would not hurt her anymore. Everyone can learn from this that an unstable person doesn't care to please other people. This book would be really good as a required reading for people wanting to go into a law profession. By reading this book we get an inside view at how laws and judges go wrong all the time
