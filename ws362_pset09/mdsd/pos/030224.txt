Just beneath the surface of this lovely Southern family saga is an impassioned plea to halt the widespread development that is threatening to destroy the flora and fauna of South Carolina's rich Low Country forever.

The story of Sweetgrass, a typically Low Country estate that has been in the Blakely family for centuries, is rich and lush just like the land. But woven neatly within the chapters is another story: that of the women of the Low Country who have been making baskets from the native sweetgrass from time immemorial. Both their art and the grass that supplies it is threatened, and if the sweetgrass goes, so goes the timeless culture of this unique part of the country.

I admit to being a Low Country wannabe. I have never been there in person, so I read authors like Mary Alice Monroe and countless others who tell its story so well. But nobody is as impassioned as Monroe. Yes, the story of the family, the patriarch felled by a stroke, the prodigal son who comes home to heal both himself and his father, the matriarch hiding a painful secret, the embittered sister-in-law intent on selling the land to developers, all of that is a magnificently interesting tale.

But the story of the sweetgrass in danger is even more compelling, and made me want to take action--whatever I can do--to save it
