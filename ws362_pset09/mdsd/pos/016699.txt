Contrary to the comments a previous reviewer, I hope most will realize the value of this excellent and practical book and give it a try. The criticism of the &quot;reader from Texas,&quot; is INANE and inappropriate. FIRST of all, the author never pretends to be a writer.  He is, however, an accomplished Pro Handler with a track record of big show wins and real life experience to share about what to do (and not to do) in the show ring. SECOND, as for the comment about &quot;how many times he belittled the owner-handler in this book,&quot;  that too is utter nonsense. He is simply pointing out the kinds of behaviors that will NOT help you to win in the ring, and isn't that the ENTIRE POINT of reading this book??? Yes, showing dogs is a sport, but the reader is in La La Land if he does not realize that what &quot;the judge likes,&quot; and &quot;how to hide faults&quot; are paramount to successfully showing and winning with your dog.  The author does not pretend to be there to discuss &quot;important aspects&quot; of dogs. One presumes that the book will be bought and read to help the amateur handler understand how best to handle their dog in the ring. Ignore this reviewer and read this book! I found it to be extremely down-to-earth and full of little gems of wisdom and hints to remember and apply. I have bought a number of more &quot;professionally written and less judgmental&quot; books on showing and handling and they are too bland and so general as to be useless. They are NOT going to be the ones that I will refer back to and read again-- but this book will be read again and again.  It's aptly named.  It is indeed full of little secrets that are important to know in the show ring. It is an OUTSTANDING and entertaining reference in a gritty, no-nonsense way. I HIGHLY recommend it
