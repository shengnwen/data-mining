Dear Amazon,

Please correct the reviews of my book!  You have the same review repeated twice at the beginning of the reviews of my book by Gene Jewett.....Please drop one of them.  

Thanks, Mark Skousen....and one more thing:  could you please stop using "Mark's Store" when I open up my amazon.com website....It's very irritating, since you obviously don't know me, but act like you did.  Please, let's have some standard business courtesy, and use last names only.

Sincerely,

Prof. M. Skouse
