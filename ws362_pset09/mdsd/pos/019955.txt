I thought this would be an interesting geeky book on being an astronaut.  What I found was a funny, interesting, exciting ride of this man's life.  I felt like I was there!  I laughed out loud at some parts, and was touched by the realities of space travel.  What brave and necessary people astronauts are in our world.
