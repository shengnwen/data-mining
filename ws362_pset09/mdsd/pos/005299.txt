Overall, it was a good book, with a good story. My only complaint is the author. He trys to be like one of those "cool" writers, seeing the words he uses and such, but he's so not, if you read the "About the author" section, and look at his picture. Kind of like one of those 12 year old girls who try to imitate Hilary Duff.
