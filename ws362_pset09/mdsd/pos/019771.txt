I am sure that every hardcore ski racer in the USA will read this book or has heard of it.  But, as I read it I am realizing that it applies to anyone interested in pursuing a dream.  Some people dream of being a great runner, biker, photographer, or whatever.... The point is, Pete Vordenberg's book is about pursuing a dream and using all your energy to do it right.  It is a great motivator and gives insight into the world of elite aerobic athletes
