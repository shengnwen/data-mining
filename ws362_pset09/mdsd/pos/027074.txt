This along with the Autobiography of Malcolm X are the two most powerful portrayals of East Coast urban psychology between the castigated and demoralized black man and the white insitutionalized power-holders circa 1930-1950.  While both end in tragedy, this one perhaps is more demoralizing as the protagonist eventually becomes completely alienated from his neighborhood, city, and nation at large.  Becomming the victim of a witch-hunt and unraveling of the moral fabric of his neighborhood, the protoganist doesn't achieve freedom or enlightenment, but instead whithers away in despair. Very upsetting and scary portrayal of the effects of marginalized politics and socio-economic/racial polarization
