This book gives a nice rundown of different handbag styles, and designers. It's simple and slightly informative. I mainly wanted the book for pictures and inspiration, which it gave me. I enjoyed the section that goes over the types of handbags, just because I was clueless as to their names and such. Overall, I was pleased
