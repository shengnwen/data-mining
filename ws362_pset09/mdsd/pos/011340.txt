I've enjoyed Foer since stumbling across "Extremely loud and incredibly close". "Everything is Illuminated" is slightly different, for although it touches on another tragedy (the Holocaust versus 9/11 in "Extremely"), some of the chuckles are more nervous laughter rather than outright guffaws. Nevertheless, this is well written, partially borrowing from Elie Weisel, partly Mel Brooks
