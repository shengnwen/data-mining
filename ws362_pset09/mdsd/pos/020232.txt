My copy is older (1986).  I imagine there is a new and updated version out.

It is co-written by Dr. Vasant Lad.  Dr. Lad is the administrator at the Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque, NM.  

I have gotten much use out of this book.  It is based on the ayurvedic medical tradition.  Herbs, American, European and Oriental are all described and assessed according to the ayurvedic principals.  There are first aid treatments, English and Sanskrit glossaries and Latin appendix.

Ayurveda can be confusing to people who have little or no background in it.  The descriptions in this book are simple and easy to understand.  Connecting the herbs and their properties is easy with the charts and information included.  There is an excellent chapter on `how to prepare and use herbs according to Ayurveda'.  

This book is an excellent primer on using herbal remedies in the Ayurvedic tradition and also an excellent sourcebook on regular herbal usage.  Even if you don't ascribe to Ayurveda the information on the herbs is very useful
