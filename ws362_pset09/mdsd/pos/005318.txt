No spoilers

The Stone Monkey is yet another blazing and captivating read by Deaver staring Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs that has plot twists throughout it that I promise you won't see coming. I won't summarize the plot, but I will say that seeing as how this is the fourth book in the Rhyme series, I doubt anyone reading this is new to Rhyme, so having said that, if you've read the previous three books and liked them, read this now. While I wouldn't say this is the best book out of the first four (it lacked the "wow" surprise factor that the others had throughout the book), it's still a great and fun book. If you haven't read Deaver before, stop reading this review and go look up and buy The Bone Collector, the first book of this series

Bottom line: another fun and informative read that a Deaver fan will demolish is minimal sittings
