I could not put this book down.  To date, I've probably given about 10 copies away to different friends as gifts, and all have been more or less mesmerized.  The information (written by a British "evolutionary biologist"--whatever that is) tells us that every sexual move we make (whether with others or alone) is dictated by some primal and subconscious urge to put forth our very best genetic efforts for the creation of successful and prolific progeny who will then propogate other successful and prolific progeny.  It can get a little bogged down in places.  However...whew! After reading this (which I recommend), it will be impossible to just lay back and enjoy it ever again without wondering what subconscious game you're both playing
