Jane Kirkpatrick has been one of my favorite authors for over 12 years. She has the gift of being able to weave a story in way that brings each moment, each place, each person to life. Read this series and you can almost touch, taste and hear the life around Maria Dorian. If you are fan of historical fiction, you are in for a real treat
