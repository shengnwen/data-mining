The previous reviewer was disappointed in the product, but they are not using it for its full potential. Springhouse just put out the Maternal Neonatal Incredibly Easy book and that's what the previous reviewer should have purchased if they wanted supplemental info for classroom work (gee, didn't they notice the description said it was a CD-ROM?!). This product is EXCELLENT not only for those students getting ready for HESI and NCLEX, but it IS an asset to those going through their nursing coursework. The product has 1000 questions catagorized within the major units of the subject of maternal and neonatal nursing. Students can access those subtopics pertaining to the material they are going over in class to use as a study aid when preparing for classroom tests. I am using the Phamacology book and CD-ROM to help me survive through Pharm this semester. What an asset! The Incredibly Easy series (books AND test question CD-ROMs) are great helps to get you through nursing school
