This is an excellent introductory book on animal rights and the suffering of animals.  Every person should know where their food comes from and what happens to your meal while it is still an animal.  In addition, the on-going and useless experiments on animals are explained in great detail.  Once again - the general public is mostly unaware of these things and it is time we found more humane and effective ways to achieve the objectives of these experiments which cause so much unnecessary suffering on animals.  I have read the critical reviews of this work and think that the critics are trying to find a 'bible' for animal rights and that is why they believe this book falls short.  There are few mentions of insidious forms of animal exploitation like hunting for example.  The philosophical section is also not as robust as it could be.  However, to Mr. Singer and to most readers - it doesn't need to be!!  It is already obvious that animals are capable of great suffering and suffer needlessly at the hands of humans.  This fact alone and the examples in this book are enough for most compassionate people who don't need a scientific or philosophical journal that tries to prove that suffering.  

All criticisms aside this is a fine book.
