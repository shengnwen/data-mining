I don't have too much to say about Tree Crops---A Permanent Agriculture wrote by J. Russell Smith and the introduction by Wendell Berry.  Its is a summary of tree choices for US lands and there potential roles as a food  source for humans and livestock.  I was most intriuged by the information  on utilizing mulberry trees as an early season feed supply for pigs and  chickens.  I would recommend the book for any sustainable ag fans who are  very willing to think outside the box
