This book is wonderful for the student who is learning on his/her own.  My sensei also recommended it during my first college class.  I started using it a year before I started any formal education in Japanese.  Be sure to pick up the Handbook too!  It provides 3 different dictionaries, two of which train you how to look up kanji in kanji dictionaries.  Using the book will help the serious self-tought student and the ambitious classroom student to excell at writing.  The only flaw is that it isn't that useful for learning to read, but there are other good texts out there for learning to read Japanese
