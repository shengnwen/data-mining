Larry Heinemann is one of our greatest writers and this book is an intense and painful trip into the hell of war. I could not put it down. Heinemann made me feel fear, anger and desperation at the insanity of war. He uses words like paint, piling detail upon detail until you are inside the story with him feeling rage at the waste of people's lives. Read it and weep. But read it if you love good writing
