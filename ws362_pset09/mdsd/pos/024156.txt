Well written book. I used it and the SelfTest Software PK0-001 exam Prep SW (002 version not yet available) to study for and pass the PK0-002 exam in less than a month. Be warned though, like everyone says, this is not you normal techie exam. If you don't understand fundamental management concepts you will have a hard time with the exam. I have had a good amount of PM experience over the years but still found this book to be helpful in addressing some of my blind spots. This is a perfect book to prep someone with some PM experience (formal or informal) to PASS the exam
