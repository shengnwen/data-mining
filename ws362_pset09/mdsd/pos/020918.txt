Walter Kaufmann's study of Hegel is astonishingly erudite and highly-readable. It is not intended to be an overview of Hegel's thought; rather, it is a supplement to further study.

Kaufmann is mostly occupied with correcting previous misinterpretations of Hegel's thought, providing useful philological material, and interpreting Hegel's philosophy in the light of extensive biographical research. It is clearly the outcome of many years of intensive study, and one comes away with the impression that Kaufmann pored over every letter and monograph he could find. 

What the book does NOT contain is a clear, flowing exegesis or interpretation of Hegel's thought. Unlike Kaufmann's "Nietzsche", Hegel's development is looked at chronologically. It is difficult to get a clear sense of Hegel's overarching thought from this study. Bursts of commentary and exegesis are broken by long, technical digressions. A wealth of footnotes provides extreme detail about discrepancies in different versions of Hegel's texts and comments on their editors and redactors. 

If you are looking for a tool to assist you in reading Hegel for yourself, this book will make a valuable companion. As an introduction to the thought of Hegel, I recommend Charles Taylor's Hegel and Modern Society.
