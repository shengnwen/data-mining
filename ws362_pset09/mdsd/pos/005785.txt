What a lifesaver to be able to pick up a book for my son going off to college that was exactly right for his needs. He had no idea about cooking terms, shelf life for foods, how to shop, clean up or what equipment to use. I especially liked the idea that there was a list of how to fix mistakes, which we are sure will happen! Hopefully he will read about how to avoid wasting leftovers. This book is perfect, geared for anyone with no previous cooking experience, and is great for anyone on a tight budget or those cooking for one. He liked the minute meals, since he has no patience to wait for food to cook, and would naturally go for frozen or junk food. With this book there is hope he will eat something healthy
