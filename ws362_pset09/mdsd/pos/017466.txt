Susan Harrow writes a complete how-to for any woman (or man) to set up and run their own PR campaign. The chapters include:

1. Achieve your Goals and Dreams with Publicity
2. Begin a Publicity Campaign
3. Write Your Press Materials
4. Create a Campaign that Suits your Style
5. Prepare Yourself Verbally and Psychologically for Media Attention
6. Create a Clear Message
7. Keep and Sustain Media Interest
8. Integrate Publicity into Your Life

As you can see from the chapter titles, this is a very complete map for anyone embarking on a publicity campaign. Tidbits abound: my favorite--how to interrupt the interrupting interviewer (priceless.) Also related, how to deal with a raging bully. (use strong "you" statements like "You need to understand that...")

I can't think of any book I've seen that is more complete and easy to read for someone entering public life. While this is pitched to women, men could benefit equally. A real winner
