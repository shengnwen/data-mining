Ian Falconer has done it again and made us all fall in love all over again with Olivia - almost in spite of ourselves. Olivia's strong personality, her even more strongly developed sense of individualism and epressiveness make her such an endearing character - especially for those of us with our own little Olivia's to contend with.
The first Olivia book with a plot line, it is really well done, though less humerous than the never-to-be-outdone original. I really have fun reading this one to my daughters. Who went around the house saying "wooshee-gaga" for days!
