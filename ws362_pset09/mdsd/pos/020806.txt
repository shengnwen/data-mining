T.O. doesn't care what people think of him.  Whether you hate him or not, he's one of the best receivers of all time in my opinion, therefore Terrell Owens is a fundamentally selfish and cruel person (and great athlete) who can hide behind a wide smile and charming persona for short periods of time as long as the NFL keeps him in the league.  Needless to say, professional sports has changed dramatically over time in regards to accepting self-motivated, selfish, and arrogant athletes time and time again.  Ultimately, stop blaming T.O. for his stupidity when he's only trying to get paid.
