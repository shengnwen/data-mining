This is a collection of dozens of folktales culled from the Gullah tradition.  They are mostly from the mid to later part of the 19th century from the coastal lowlands area of Georgia.  The hundred + year-old tales are transcribed in a dialect, but they shouldn't be considered authentic renditions of the Gullah creolized language.  The book has a great introduction that explains how Jones came to compile the work and write other books on a range of subjects.  The dialect of the stories take a while to understand, but the glossary at the end of the book helps explain unfamiliar words.  The stories are really good ones, and it is great to see this important book in print
