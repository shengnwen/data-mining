My son and I met the author last night.  He is wonderful and very fascinating in how he writes and how the characters come to life for him.  If you get a chance to meet him, take it!

My son, who is 11, liked this book.  He gave it a 4 out of 5 stars with 5 stars reserved for his favorite series:  Cat Warriors and Edge Chronicles
