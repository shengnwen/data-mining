If you read and enjoyed the Millionaire next door this book is a great follow up for more of how the real millionaires think. I is basically the same and the before mentioned book however in this book the author makes a successful attempt to get inside a millionaires head by studying their behavior.

Examples:
They don't waste money on new furniture they reupolster when possible.
They think differently from the crowd.
They surround themselves with competatant people.
They find employment that allows them to use all of their abilities and talents.
They accurately judge people.
When marrying they choose partners that they are attracted to and are intelligent,honest, unselfish, and well adjusted.
And, much more.

This book is a wealth of information on how REAL millionaires think. It is a little long but the book will pay for itself in insights. These principles have brought me from poverty to a $175,000 net worth and I am truly just getting started.
