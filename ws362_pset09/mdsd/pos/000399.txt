I wouldn't say this book was the most comprehensive on fertility treatments, and it was a bit redundant with it's cute email-style writing, but if you are TTC (Trying to Concieve), you need to read it anyways.  I really identified with the authors and felt as though I was reading my own story.  It just felt so good to laugh, and to know I'm not the only one having these crazy thoughts and emotions while despirately wanting to get pregnant. 

This book helped me put things into perspective again with my husband (my secrets out...I've been manipulating him for his sperm) and my non-fertility challenged friends. Perhaps it has even saved a relationship with a friend who's conceived twice during my own efforts. 

It was fun to read and useful in its own unique way.
