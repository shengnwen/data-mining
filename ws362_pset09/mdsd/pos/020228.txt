If you're looking for a "first" Eleanor biography, don't start with this one.  Read it eventually, but not at first.

If you have read her collected writings, "No Ordinary Time"  or the biography(ies) by Blanche Wiesen Cook this autobiography is a much needed voice.   It may not be as engrossing or tantlizing as the others, but it offers a layered look into her history. I struggled with the Wiesen Cook books but ended up enjoying them very much and I would have to say that with out them, this autobiography would not have had such an impact.  What she shares in her autobiography is enlightening at times, but what is more significant is the specifics she leaves out or vaguely refers to in the generalist of terms.  

The best way to describe this book is comparing it to a long chat with a woman you've respected for a long time.  You knew things about her, you heard the rumors, but now you're sitting with her, listening to her tell you how she really felt things happened.
