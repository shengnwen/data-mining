Recipes are fairly simple, which greatly enhances the probability that the reader will actually use them. Also the recipes aren't so many, which is good since you just need a few good ones, not an confusing endless array of them. Food is put in a context in a humorous way, which is a nice bonus.

The charm of the book made it one of my favorite cookbooks after the first five (thick) pages.

I bought the book for mysel, but I think it would also make a great gift
