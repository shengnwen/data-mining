Bookfinds is about as good a guide as one can get to the used book trade.  I am a book dealer (three years on my own) and worked in a large independent store during which time I priced over a million books over the course of five years.  Yes, my hand guiding a pencil to physically write a price on over a million different books.  This book is geared at the book lover who wants to make their collecting self sustaining or even profitable.  I did not think his list of collectible books was worthwhile, but here are the topics in which the advice is most useful:

1) Where to find books
2) How to sell books (but his margins are optimistic)
3) His list of book references
4) Types of books to look for (what type of sports book, what type of theology, etc...)

But the most effective thing Ellis communicates is the mind frame of a book dealer.  This is how we think, how we calculate and how we make money.  I have a regular route, just like he suggests in the book.  I have explored and made money off of every venue he lists.  I have made small repairs to improve a book's salability.  I have both been helped and hurt by the Internet book market.  I take certain types of stock to certain stores in a certain order.  Instead of trying to describe what I do, I often recommend this book with, "This is basically right".  
This is not a how-to manual in the sense that it will say "Go to website x and put y books at z price online and make big bucks!"  Folks, the market changes fast and a book that gives the broad strokes correctly will be of much more use in a year than one that is precise today.  I highly recommend Bookfinds for the collector looking for tools to make back some of their investment.  But dealers and scouts might find some useful tidbits as well.
