I loved this sparse tale about letting go of that which really doesn't matter and grabbing hold of that which makes all the difference in our lives.

This book reminded me of MRS. DALLOWAY or THE HOURS with it's main character doing so much internalizing.  Her "interior" life was rich and full, even if her "outside" life was plain and simple.  I read the book in one sitting and was charmed.  

I'd like to read more by this author.  

Enjoy
