While nothing overly dramatic occurs in the story I still found it entirely interesting in that it is simply a second-hand account of a person's journey on the path rarely followed.   The writer, as narrator, occasionally speaks directly to the reader as though it were a private conversation which lends itself nicely to the reserved tone of the story.  The writer/narrator has a keen eye for detail so that the story becomes almost fascinating -- especially for those, like the secondary characters and perhaps the narrator himself, who tend to shy away from the mystical and spiritual.  One need not buy into these things in order to participate in and enjoy the yarn. 
I also liked that the story spanned several actual historical events, the impacts of which were incorporated into the lives of the characters
