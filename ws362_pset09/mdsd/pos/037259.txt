This is the 4th book in Flynn's series.  If you can, you'll really want to read them in order.  This one took quite a while to get going.  The first 80 pages were little else but recapping the prior three books.  I think some recap is fine, but this was way too much.  From there, I thought it still had trouble getting traction.  Finally, about the last 1/3 of the book took off and kept me page turning.

I love the serial aspect of these novels, they flow nicely from one book to the next.  I also like Flynn's mixture of actual history with his fictional world.

So, far of the 4 books, the 1st and 2nd have been the best for action, the 3rd and 4th were much more focused on Washington DC rather than "front line" action.

Appropriateness:  This book contains a fair amount of language... a word or two every 10 pages.  There are characters that are hurt and killed, but none are described graphically.  Sexual situations are eluded to, but are not in this book
