Beginner and seasoned card makers/crafters will all find items in here to spark the imagination and get the creative juices flowing. I am pacing myself and reading it a little at a time. It's organized by theme, though, so if you want to go straight to the Easter or Halloween sections, it's easy to do so. Best of all, it's not strictly about cardmaking; there are a lot of party throwing tips and other fun things to make up (gift baskets, mini albums, table decor, gift tags). 
     It's definitely a companion piece to PaperCrafts' Tips and Techniques book, which goes into more detail onto how to actually do the stamping/bleaching/cutting techniques often used in paper crafting. I'd say if you had the 2 books and weren't itching to try out some of the ideas and tips they contained, you should pursue a different hobby
