This book was both spell-binding and educational.  I read it to my 11 and 12 year old daughters. They could read it themselves, but I enjoyed it too.  It has a mature theme, but it is handled well.  It also has a subtle wisdom that is neither preachy nor heavy handed.  Love is the greatest of virtues.  Mercy is near the top, and hatred should be overcome
