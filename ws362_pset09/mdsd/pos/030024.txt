This book carried me into a merky afterworld that I normally would have been afraid to go- but was compelled to travel with Fishboy as his invisble  witness. Its hypnotic pros drew me into the novel as the journey of a soul  is never an easy one - but incredibley rewarding. Richard's voice is  similar to Angela Carter and Mikial Bulgakov but with a smokey southern  drawl. This book reads like a beautiful and terrible painting. If you enjoy  well crafted pros and are unhibited about exploring the darker  psychological side of human nature, I highly recommend Fishboy
