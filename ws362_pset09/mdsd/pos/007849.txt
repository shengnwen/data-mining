David and Tom Gardner's writing style seems to try to imitate their speaking style on their NPR show, but it doesn't always translate well to the page.  Some of their off-the-cuff humor is actually funny, but much of it just gets in the way.

Nonetheless, they've compiled a decent collection of all the things we boomers need to think about as we near the end of our regular working days.  They ask us to think about why we want to "retire" (while shunning the word as sounding too much like withdrawing, which is not what a good retirement is about); they help us figure out how much we'll need; they remind us about such topics as health care, long-term care, caring for our parents, and estate planning.

Although much of the information was a bit vague (mainly because no one book can describe the best plan for everyone), I found many useful tips and resources (I've bookmarked dozens of websites) in every chapter, including the chapter on saving for your kid's college education, despite the fact that I have no children.  (I do, however, have nieces and nephews, who might just benefit from one of the tips...)

If you read this book, you should make sure you read other financial-type books too (Suze Orman and Jean Chatzky are two authors whose books I've liked, and I have one from Money Magazine in my queue), as differing viewpoints will empower you to discover what's right for you in your situation
