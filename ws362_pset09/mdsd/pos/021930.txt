I'm 41 and divorced.  This book was not for me....  The audience is really the younger and non-divorced crowd.  An 18-year-old friend and a 28-year-old friend LOVED this book, so I thought I'd give it a try.  If you're like me, buy "I've Kissed a Lot of Frogs but My Prince Hasn't Come" (or something like that) by Kathleen Hardaway.  The "Frogs" book is much better suited for you, if you're a divorced and/or older 40+ single.

The book IS well-written. I agreed with all that Janet wrote, and her style is extremely lively and very conversational -- like she's talking just to you
