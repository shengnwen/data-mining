The Oregon Trail still stands as a classic of American literature and of a rapidly vanishing past.  Written as an account of a summer he spent traveling the Oregon Trail, Parkman captures the details of communal Native American life with no sentimentality, just hard reality.  Even though written in 1846, Parkman is amazingly precise in his estimation of the vanishing frontier and Native American way of life.  At times, he is rather callous toward the Native Americans, but this also reflects his times and environment.  Highly recommended.
