Israel Regardie's genius shines through, once again, as he uses his experience in the field of psychology to show us the direct connections between Magick, Spirituality and the human mind.  If you have a serious  interest in Magick, general Occultism, any form of religion or  spirituality, or psychology/psychiatry, this is certainly a book that would  help a lot with your studies!  And, yet again, the Ciceros have shown us  their wonderful understanding of Magick.  But this time, they've added  psychology to their accomplishments!  This book is a must-have for all  Occultists
