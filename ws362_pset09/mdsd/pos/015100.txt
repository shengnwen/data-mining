It is a story of a young guy named Cal who lives in the Land of Hate (Northern Ireland) where he can be beaten and his house set on fire only because he is a Catholic. He gave up his work in an abattoir in a week,  being repelled by its blood and atrocity, but became a driver in IRA's  raids that brought misfortune and pain to the ordinary innocent people. We  see what Hate can do with a person: it leads Cal's father to physical and  psychical collapse (victim); it makes a 30-year-old teacher an implacable  personification of Death and Destruction and a school hooligan a killing  machine (executors). Cal is lone in the world with father as his only  relative and music as his only friend, and they can't help him to overcome  a deadlock. But his love to a woman, whose husband he helped to murder a  year before, converts his guilt and sorrow into genuine repentance. At  least since the time of Shakespeare we know that Love is doomed in the Land  of Hate but it changes the Land in the end
