So, everyone knows that Harrison's is the Bible for internists and residents of internal medicine.  As a 3rd year medical student, I used the book to research whenever I had to give a presentation or wanted to know more about my patients.

As a pgy-1 in psychiatry now, I find this book more useful than ever, but in a different sense.  Being on psych rotations now, I often find that new onset psychosis might be the result of a general medical condition.  Although the interface between psychiatry and medicine has improved over the years, my colleagues in medicine of see in black and white regarding this kind of presentation (ie this person is crazy; psych should be treating him).  

Consequently, I want to remain not only diplomatic when talking with ER and Medicine residents and attendings, but also want to seem knowledgeable and tailor my thought process more to their speciality.  This is where Harrison's is helping me.  I read up on the conditions, labs, and treatments of my differential so that when I call, I sound knowledgeable and have a specific idea of how they can help me out.  Stating that you're reading from Harrison's lets others know that you're thinking about the patient and not just wanting to dump on another service.

Other reviews have discussed how this version is great with color and treatment boxes; I completely agree.  It's nice to have such a large text that you can actually read.

I recommend this book for any of the following:

1.  3rd year students on an internal medicine rotation
2.  Obviously internal medicine residents and internists
3.  Everyone else in medicine for the reasons listed above.  No matter what our specialties, we're all medical doctors and should have an excellent medical reference.  Harrison's has been and will always be the gold standard
