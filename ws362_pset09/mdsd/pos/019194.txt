&quot;Keep Talking&quot; contains over one hundred different  fluency-building activities for the language teacher to use either  directly, or with modification, in her language classroom. Each activity  has a well defined purpose, whether it be functional or structural, and is  categorized according to language level, skill and student arrangement,  stating clearly whether or not preparation is necessary, and how long the  tasks typically take. The procedural instructions are lucid and relatively  easy to convey to most groups of language learners, and there is also scope  for variation for many of these language games, along with helpful comments  on how make such activities fun and achievable. If one also includes the  importance of making notes, and obtaining feedback, which Kippel suggests  in the introduction, then it is clear just how useful this book is.  Although I was at first confused as to why the author grouped his language  learning activities under themes such as jigsaw task, interview, or story  telling, rather than according to function or structure, I think his point  is to focus on fluency and engendering a communicative atmosphere, rather  than to actually teach anything or practice something too specific. The  teacher's role, therefore, appears to be as a facilitator or classroom  manager. In any case, the indexes include language structure (but not  function) and level, making navigating relatively straight-forward.  &quot;Keep Talking&quot; also contains about sixty worksheets which can be  copied for use in class. Although I no longer use them in my teaching  situation, I borrow ideas from them all the time. This book is not suitable  for formal institutions, but otherwise, whether you are new to language  teaching, or a seasoned pro, I feel fairly confident that there is  something in this book for you
