As the foreward of this book says, daily Jewish prayers instill values in children.  When we say a prayer before we eat, children understand that it's important to be thankful for what we have, including food on the table.  When we pray before going to sleep for our safety, kids learn to be thankful for their lives.  The bottom line:  we love this book.  It has prayers for greeting the new day, and bedtime prayers.  When our beloved pet cat passed away this week, we opened the book to the prayer for mourners.  By coincidence, the page included an illustration of an elderly woman with a cat!  The words and illustrations are right on target for children, and parents will appreciate it, too.  I highly recommend this book, and plan to buy it as baby gifts for family and friends
