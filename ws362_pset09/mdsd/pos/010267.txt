No kidding. This book will take you places you don't want to go...and yet, all you can think about while you're reading it is how cool it would be to have gone. It's Huck Finn for a modern age (but better 'cause he actually gets the girl!) combined with a sense of maturity and social responsibility expressed in  the author's caring for others that makes this a permanent addition to the library
