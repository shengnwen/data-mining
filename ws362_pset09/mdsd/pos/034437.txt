I am a doctor now, but i used this book when i was a medical student and i thought it was great.

Some people may say it does not have a lot of detail.  But i thought the annotations were pretty detailed. And i had the 2nd Edition!

There is no way you can know all that is in this book and NOT get a good grade on your anatomy final!

The only down side, its a bit time consuming, all that colouring takes time. SO use it WITH your course work.  Dont wait till you are close to exams, because you wont have time.

To tell you how much i loved this book, i bought a copy of the 3rd edition for a friend of mine who is starting med school in september!

BUY IT!!!
