'The Woman in the Dunes' is my first Kobo Abe novel, and it is allegedly one his most accessible (read: least weird) novels.  While the book is well written (kudos to the translator) it certainly has an unusual if not bizarre story.  I am somewhat surprised at the glowing praises of the amazon.com reviewers.

As for the story, it is about the enslavement of a young man by villagers residing literally in the dunes of a remote corner of Japan.  He becomes the worker bee and companion of a widow whose house is literally enveloped by huge sand dunes. The young man develops a relationship of sorts with the woman, tries hard to escape from his imprisonment, and copes with the daily hardships of living in a sandpit. ... and that's about it.  Yes, there are some interesting moments from a human interaction perspective.  And Kobo Abe keeps the story compelling, although I'm not sure how.  It certainly isn't a book I'll forget anytime soon.


Bottom line: clearly a surreal story worthy of being considered a classic.  Big points on originality but the entire reading experience leaves a somewhat bad (sandy?) aftertaste
