Well, I was anxious to get this book... in 2003 when it was supposed to be released.  A lengthy couple of years and my enthusiasm turned slightly into dread that it would never come out.  Finally, it made it past whatever hurdles had so delayed it.

I confess that I was a fan of Green Lantern in my youth, and I am woefully ignorant of the current setting.  Thus, while some other reviewers have noted the severe divergences from the comic story, I cannot provide that (much like how some people love movies based on books when they haven't read them, but the people who have read the book are outraged at alterations -- I am typically among the latter by the way). 

The book does a fairly good job of telling the story of how a young man inexplicably and randomly ends up with a Green Lantern ring and the immense power it gives its wearer.  Kyle is a down and out artist with no confidence and no luck.  He gets the ring in a back alley after losing out on pursuing a girl, and life takes a big turn from there.  

He gradually learns how to use the ring somewhat subconsciously or from the ring itself, or so it would seem (the actual mechanism is a bit iffier but is explained).  He meets up with the Justice League and pretty quickly falls into their poor graces by being a typical flaky young man with personal concerns and no desire to be a hero.  When the Justice League disappears mysteriously, save for Kyle and Batman, Kyle is tasked with the quest to recover them.  What follows is some outlandish coincidences that affects the very nature of reality and all the beings living in it, which only Kyle and a couple alien helpers to save.

The characterization is good, and the book flies by.  I was left wanting a bit more, as Kyle essentially becomes a new man after his hero quest.  While this is not the best of the JLA books, it is a decent read, at least for those like me who have not kept up with the comics for over a decade
