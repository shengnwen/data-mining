This is a great book. I think Puryear did a great job researching for this book. He draws insight from many 4-stars throughout the US military and packages it nicely. There is a lot of history in the shaping of the American Military discussed in this book. Plus there is enough information to make it a good collection to anyone in upper management in the business world. 

I decided to read this since it was on the CSAF reading list. I have found it to be insightful. I now understand the shaping of the AF, can see how the PFE and other leadership documents have focused on the great leaders of the past and present.
