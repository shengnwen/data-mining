Sue Grafton continues to keep the reader entertained in her alphabet series with H IS FOR HOMICIDE. Her unique writing style is more like someone telling his/her favorite story and you only have to sit back and enjoy the tale.

In this book Kinsey Millhone is hired to investigate the death of a claims adjuster and uncovers an insurance scam in the process. The trail leads into Los Angeles on her pursuit of a violent individual who may be the murderer. Kinsey is not afraid of following the suspect through the seedier side of LA and even into a bar adequately named "The Meat Locker" (gee, can you guess what kind of bar this is?). This is the fearless Kinsey Malone that we see in this saga.

Yes, this is the insurance world's underground and Sue Grafton leads us through it with humor and a very biased opinion. Who else could come up with a singles bar named "The Meat Locker" and get away with the reader chuckling about it? Her books show her very funny sense of humor and nothing is immune to her wit. 

In H IS FOR HOMICIDE, Grafton shows us that no one is protected from corruption and does this in such a way that not only do we find it funny but disgusting at the same time. As always, her characters are, well for lack of a better description, characters. They continuously encompass a wide variety of people from every walk of life that is one of the reasons people can submerse themselves into Grafton's books. 

Her continuing books revolving around Kinsey Millhone are interesting reading and not the type of books that are a cerebral exercise, but more of a story being told by a master storyteller. They are definitely books to be enjoyed.
