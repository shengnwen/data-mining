If you live in a city without English in its bookstores, what do you read? Well, odds are you encounter a Westerner from time to time and exchange books you've read for books you haven't. You never know what you'll wind up with. It's Book Crossing, taken to a much higher level. 

And so it was that I found myself looking at a battered copy of MORGAN'S PASSING, with no memory of who gave it to me or what book(s) I gave up in return. Pages brown and falling out, cover falling off, blurbs that make it sound like something I didn't want to read. But, a desperate junkie in need of my reading fix, I gave it a shot. 

And, at last, the review. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story of how I obtained it is much like the character of Morgan himself. He just kind of appears -- you don't know why -- but you're glad you met the memorable eccentric. This book is witty, original, and well worth reading. Ignore the [...] on the cover about "the love story." The book has one, but it's incidental. Some marketing bozo didn't know how to describe true creativity. 

Okay, time to go broke ordering more Anne Tyler books from Amazon. All the way from China. There's even a Putlizer Prize winner in there.
