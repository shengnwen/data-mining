This Audio book is very similar to his regular book called "Set Your Voice Free".  Although this book seems more geared towards speakers while the other seems more geared towards singers.

A lot of information about developing your voice (breathing, overcoming undesirable vocal traits, finding your middle voice) was also in his regular book called "Set Your Voice Free".  There are a lot of passages that are copied word-for-word.  A lot of the vocal exercises are identical. I found that information very helpful.  

Some information, that is not in "Set Your Voice Free", deals more with pyschological mumbo jumbo about developing a postive mindset.  Like overcoming your fears by telling yourself "they want to hear me.  They love me".  Or overcoming your nervousness by simply being prepared.  I don't know whether this information is useful or not.

So if you get one book, you could probably just skip the other
