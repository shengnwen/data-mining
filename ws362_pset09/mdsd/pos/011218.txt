Other reviewers have gone into details on the actual plot.  Comments on some of the pieces that make the book so interesting:  the description of life along the docks in England was gritty and riveting.  Grimes had us walking the docks with Monk, seeing through his eyes--almost like a televison camera --how people lived and struggled daily to survive. Hester's work with ill prostitutes is also presented in a very realistic manner--there is nothing sugarcoated about the lives Grimes describes. 

Monk is presented as one of the more liberated men in literary works: he understands when his wife is working long hours and respects what she's doing. Grimes has delivered a good mystery here along with an interesting wife-husband relationship.  A book worth reading.
