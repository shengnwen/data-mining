There are certain people and particular pieces of literature that belong to the fabric of man's truest nature. This book, like &quot;Leaves Of Grass&quot; and &quot;Walden&quot; and Emerson's essays, belongs in that category. This is one of those books that are for those quiet moments when the inner space within needs nourishment. Carpenter is the type of man I long to talk to. He understands the fundamentals of the human experience. He is very different than W.W. yet very similar. W.W.'s poetry is more to my liking but Carpenter's temperament and perspective makes W.W. more poignant and relevant. Very powerful lives and natures entangled in the cosmic dance of life. They compliment one another. This is a book to be sipped and savoured in the quiet moments at either the beginning or end of one's day
