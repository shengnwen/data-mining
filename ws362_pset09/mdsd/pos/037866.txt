I bought this book for my girlfriend who is going to Guatemala for an 8-week field study for her master's degree in anthropology. The pictures are in no way artistic photographs, I would classify them as documentary photos. There are a few that have some drama or depth to them, but most are simply documenting the Guatemalen culture through thier famous colorful weavings and how they use them.

My girlfriend and I wish that the pictures had lengthier captions to explain what we were looking at, as most of the images only have the name of the city they are from. There is a brief and simple introduction at the beginning of the book about Guatmalen culture, the weavings and Mayan history, but the rest of the book is all pictures.

I gave it to my girlfriend to get her excited and motivated for her coming field study, and in that respect I guess the book was a success
