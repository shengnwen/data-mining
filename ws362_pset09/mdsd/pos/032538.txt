I read this book and am delighted with how well the author has captured the essence of Faith.  I agree with most of the reviews, it is a easy and well done read that any Buffy fan should add to their collection.  This author is very imaginative and I love his portrayal of Faith.  I don't know what book the one reviewer who didn't like this book was reading, but the one I read was EXCELLENT
