When you pick up this book, don't think that you are going to learn everything you want to know about the 4 majors. This book focuses solely on the stories in 1998. With O'Meara winning the Masters and the British and Vijay Singh and Lee Janzen winning the PGA and US Open respectively, in comparison, it wasn't that exciting a year. Don't get me wrong, there were some interesting storylines and it was well written, but if you are a golf fan who knows some of his/her stuff, you will not learn too much. One thing I did not hear before this was that Rae's Creek is dyed blue every year. There are a few other interesting tidbits, but not too many. All in all, it was well written, but not too difficult to read. Very easy to follow
