I bought "Automatic Wealth for Grads... And Anyone Else Just Starting Out" for my daughter's 19th birthday.  She read Automatic Wealth a year ago and loved it!  (Even though she said that Mr. Masterson sounded too arrogant.)  I told her that he was only giving out advice that worked for him to build his wealth.  So... when Michael Masterson published his book for grads... I just had to buy it for my daughter.  I gave it to her a couple of days ago and she told me last night that she was getting more out of this book than the first.  I have to admit that I snuck a peek at her book before I gave it to her.  I thought it had more detailed information than his original version.  He breaks down his information in easy to follow steps and descriptions.  Now I will have to buy it for my library!  She said that I can not borrow it... she is stingy with her library collection
