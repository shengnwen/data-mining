I understand the reasons for the negative reviews. This book is slightly incoherent, and randomly touches on topics (the strangest being the whole chapter discussing a hedge fund based on a time traveling Wall Street Journal). Bizzare, I admit.

But those reviews miss the point of this book - Barton Biggs has a great personality, which comes across well. He relays stories you would never get to hear unless you were already a friend (in which case you are already fortunate) or met him in a bar for drinks (in which case your recollection of his stories would be too hazy to be reliable).

This book doesn't really give investment advice in the typical sense. He relates his attempt to launch his own fund, and in doing so he touches on investment related topics from Keynes to investment banking to prime brokering. In a scene worthy of F. Scott Fitzgerald he describes being invited to a fund raising party straight out of The Great Gatsby, with all the smiles and insincerity you'd expect. And with his name tag and fund raising pitch at the ready, he unabashedly admits how desperate he felt there.

That type of personal honesty is refreshing, and is rare in financial stories. Anyone with experience in this industry will relate, and admit to having been on both the naive and the not-so-innocent side. As Mr. Biggs promises in the beginning of the book, while names have been changed, everything in this book is true (besides one obvious chapter). And it is that type of honesty which more than makes up for the other flaws in this book. I recommend it.

As far as that time travelling WSJ, I am doing my best to track it down. Where are those astro-physics quants when you really need them
