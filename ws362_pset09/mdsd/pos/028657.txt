 As an I-Banker at a regional firm I always enjoy reading books such as this.  This is a mixed bag.  Knee starts the book discussing his internship in London, what a "rookie" does, what he did well, what he did not do well, and why he didn't want to do this forever.  But, after an MBA and a short career with an airline, he's back at it again, and with success.  He "accidentally" fell into a role and used his wit to carve out a successful niche.  This is where this book is at its best and an excellent, fast read. 

Unfortunately, it's not quite a full book and Knee feels the need to regurgitate a past history of Goldman Sachs, the excellent firm for which he works.  This is where the book slows down and is totally out of character with the title.  Given I had just read "Goldman Sachs: Culture of Success" written by Lisa Endlish to whom he refers liberally, this was really of no interest to me.

Finally, we're back to his career change to Morgan Stanley in New York and now have a new problem, the total collapse of deals where bankers earn their money.  This is quite interesting also.  As I-bankers will attest, the business becomes ruthless with inter-fighting as everyone grabs for the few crumbs of income, people must be let go and mansions and egos must be protected.

Overall, I love the book and I'd rather he had shortened the book and stayed on subject instead of spending 30% of time on a history lesson before jumping back to his career.  So, be forewarned, it's good with a twist.
