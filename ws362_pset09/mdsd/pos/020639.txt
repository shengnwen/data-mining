The excitement I got from reading this novel reminded me of the first time I read a book by Cormac McCarthy, or Garcia Marquez, or even early Steven King.  It's just unforgettable.  Like the writers I've mentioned, Canaan's Tongue creates a world that looks a lot like ours, a world that convinces completely but at the same time is deeply strange and unsettling.  I read in an interview that Wray wanted to write a book that commented on America today--sort of like a fairy-tale, but also like a political cartoon--and maybe that explains the bizarreness of some parts of the narrative.  Except this book is way too creepy to be a political cartoon.  I read it in about two days, and I really felt somehow altered when I finished the last page. Unbelievably powerful writing
