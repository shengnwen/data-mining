When at first picked up this book i was a little anxious thinking it would be difficult to understand. the first exercises begin with cubes and shading. yet when i did them they made alot of sense. it tells you how to draw things in proportion and where the shadows belong. 
also it provides excellent examples of the diffrent views one must draw. (from above and below for example) and it also includes diffrent character designs and what there role would be in manga. yes, i found it valuable, and woulds suggest to anyone who wants to learn or just go over something to buy it
