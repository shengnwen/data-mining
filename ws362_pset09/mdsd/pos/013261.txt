In thinking about how I'd describe this book, I was influenced by a previous reviewer who found fault because there are no pictures in the book. I would counter that by saying this book has hundreds of pictures, the only difference is they are mental pictures shaped by the evocative writing style of Pete Hamill. 

What I think Hamill has created is a book that vividly describes past events, people and places the way most of us would remember events in our own lives. Our memory doesn't function like a photo album, it functions based on visualizing partial images with emphasis on the subject at hand. I think that's what Hamill has done. He doesn't describe in minute detail Battery Park, he describes it in glimpses that evoke a sense of the place. Providing pictures of Times Square would help in the detail, but it wouldn't fit with a narrative offered by someone remembering the place as it was for a 10 year old child.
