The essence of Salinger is his ability to take a static situation and run with it.  I found the first of the two stories to be the most effective.  Don't expect Catcher in the Rye here, and the way Salinger slows down the pace, describing each character to a tee, getting the reader to concentrate on the energy of the characters, and not merely a premise, is why this book is so wonderful.  The story almost has a "slow motion" feel to it, and in my opinion, that is what makes it so genius.  Readers who quickly dismissed this book, likely don't have much patience, and are more proned to reading supermarket varieties
