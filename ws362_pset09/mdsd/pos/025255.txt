I loved this book.  After reading The Rising, I couldn't wait to read this book to see what happened next in the series.  I havent read the rest of the series because I plan on reading them in order.  Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins do a wonderful job with this book telling the lives of its characters switching back and forth between each point of view smooth and efficiently.  I can't wait till The Rapture is released so I can finally read it and then read the twelve remaining books of the series
