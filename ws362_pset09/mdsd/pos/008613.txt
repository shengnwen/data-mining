I absolutely fell head over heals for Orson in Fear Nothing, and, I really like Chris, Sasha, and Bobby, too.  So I made a bee-line for part two - Seize the Night. 
Once again Dean's heroes are complete - funny, thoughtful, and ready to go the distance for each other no matter how scary it is.  The problem is, if you are listening to these books on disc/tape... Dean does way tooooooo much catching you up on the history from Fear Nothing.  More than once I fast forwarded and more than once I growled, "What about Orson!?".  No worries though, it all turns out as it should and is a great story...  I want more!
As always the imagery and Dean's ability to pull you to the edge of your seat are extraordinary, and the reader (Keith Szarabajka), though at first may not "sound" right, is perfect.
