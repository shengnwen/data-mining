The plot of this book is as described elsewhere.

Whether you read Radclyffe's series books, like the Justice series or the Honor series or the Provincetown series, or you read one of her stand-alone romances, you can not go wrong.  

I have been reading lesbian fiction for many years, and can honestly say that I have never come across a writer that has so affected me.  Her characters are strong, intelligent, and romantic.  Naysayers will say that Radclyffe's characters are too perfect almost never flawed - either in looks or character.  That may be true, but aren't you tired of the genre's penchant for ordinary?  Radclyffe's characters are always enchanting, intoxicating, enticing, and intense.  The stories, particularly in the series books, are all first class.  Most of her series books are page-turners.  And in two of the books, I actually turned to the last page to make sure that the main characters survived - something I never do.  

Radclyffe let us believe, at least for the duration of each of her books, that the grand passion, the true love, the happy-ever-after are all possible.  She lets us believe that being a strong, intelligent woman does not mean that we will be alone and/or isolated.  

The only caveat I have is to read the series books in order.  And if you enjoy watching a writer grow, then read the non-series books in the order they were written and watch Radclyffe's talent grow before your very eyes.
