This was a lightning-quick read; there is not much particularly challenging about this novel, but it was a lot of fun.  Maupin successfully evokes a very specific time and place (1970s San Francisco) and interweaves multiple storylines.  Some important social issues (homosexuality is a big one) are dealt with in a non-judgmental and entertaining way. 
Tales of the City features several characters who rent apartments at 28 Barbary Lane from one Anna Madrigal, a mysterious woman in her fifties who has a sketchy past.  Mary Ann Singleton fulfills the role of naive Midwestern newcomer who falls in love with SF while vacationing and decides to relocate, only to have significant trouble adjusting to the completely different social mores of her new home.  There are, of course, many other characters, each with their own storylines.  I am looking forward to reading the next installment of the series
