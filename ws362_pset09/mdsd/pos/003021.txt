Safe Strategies is by far the most comprehensive book on financial management I have ever read.  If you want a better understand of trading, a realistic analysis of your financial position, a plan to eliminate all your debt in years instead of decades, effective tools to increasing your own personal wealth, or just an overall understanding of your financial option beyond your day job, I strongly recommend Safe Strategies.  Van Tharp's online newsletter is an incredible resource that compliments and expands upon many of the concepts in his book.
