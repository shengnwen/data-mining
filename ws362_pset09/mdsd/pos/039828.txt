This book is a 5 for awakening of what was Harlem NY and for a sociological book, but a 4 because it is not something you will enjoy reading 2x.  It is deep, complex, and if you are a young person reading it or someone unfamiliar with the mentallity of the oppressed being an oppressor in a unfeeling world...you may have to stop for a second and take a breath.  The book is well written from a sociological and anthropological perspective and it will go from your heart and mind to the pit of your stomach, but it certainly is a wake up call to the social changes and conditions of poverty, drug use & abuse and the people sucked into that world
