In the last six weeks I've bought six knitting books.  All but one, "Loop-d-Loop", are recently published.

I looked at "Loop-d-Loop" at least a dozen times before I finally bought it.  I read about the author, I looked at some of her patterns on line and in knitting magazines, but I didn't buy the book.  I'd pick "Loop-d-Loop" up everytime I went to a bookstore but I'd also put it back down.  It's a beautiful book, well photographed, well written, clear patterns, interesting notes by the author but for some reason I couldn't commit.  What was the problem I asked myself?  Then I realized what is was about the book.  The book looked a little too challenging for a person who had just started knitting to relax.  Somehow the book seemed to look down its nose at me, an average knitter who had just start to knit garments.  

Could I knit these amazing items?  Would they frustrate me to the point I would stop knitting? (That had happened before.) Well I bought it and it is now one of my favorite books.  How did I get over that hump?  Well, first of all, I had to started thinking all patterns are just knitting and purling.  That may seem simple to you but for me it was a hugh revelation.  I also had to start thinking of myself as a knitter and not a want-to-be. 

I'm telling you this little story about my book buying issues because I hope you won't let the same sort of thing effect you.  Buy this book because this is the kind of book that will enrich you and make you want to take your knitting to the next level.  "Loop-d-Loop" is a great book to pore over while sitting sipping a cup of tea.  The more you study it, the more you will learn.  Once you buy "Loop_d_Loop" and spend some time going through it, you'll find the patterns are not that complicated; the end result just look amazing. I just cast on the "yoke vest" and I can't wait to see how it turns out.  Happy knitting
