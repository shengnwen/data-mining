This was a top start to the Inspector Rebus series. Ian Rankin wrote an excellent little book that I found to be highly interesting and readable. 

It was the kind of book that one can read and while you know it isn't a masterpiece in the vein of a Michael Connelly or James Lee Burke, you can see that the author has all the makings of being a top writer.

Highly recommended
