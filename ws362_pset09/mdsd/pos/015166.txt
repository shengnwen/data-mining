The book has all of the good aspects which other reviewers have given it, but Smith should have given it a re-read before publication. It reads as though he rushed through it to get it on the market, and re-used material from his other works. (He says as much at the beginning and at the end.)  I am pretty sure that he knows that the word "Christ" comes from the Greek, not the Hebrew, (as the text says), and that most New Testament scholars think that Paul did NOT write Ephesians as his very clever illustration on p.24 says. These appear to be mistakes made in the haste of writing. Still, this is a very helpful book, even though it is not quite up to the standard of C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity" or even Marcus Borg's recent elucidation of the essence of Christianity. His critiques of both fundamentalism and the modern religion of scientism are on target, and worth the price of the book
