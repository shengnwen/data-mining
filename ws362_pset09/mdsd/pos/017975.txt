blake has a sincere and vivid imagery, with empathy as portrayed by his characters.  the portrayal of what real violence is, has to win Blake some kind of award.  his characters are real, and they react as normal men (and women) would react under similar circumstances,anger, loss of a sibling, or, just trying to survive in this world of the 1840's.  in the author's heart, there is a certain compassion, as seen in real men under real and violent circumstances---and the acceptance of one's fate.
cormack mccarthy sees the forest of violence, blake sees the leaves in the forest--a destiny to which the main characters are condemned.  i wonder what war blake served in, or does he see true visions as his namesake the artist and poet (edward blake) saw violence in his poetry and art.  Blake  sure knows how to describe violence with reality.  this book will stir your emotions.
