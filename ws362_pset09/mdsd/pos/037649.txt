De Botton makes the case that what makes bad anxiety is wants placed upon us that are really not our own but stem from other sources wishing to command us like commercialism and the message the ruling class wants out there, as to what success is; the ruling class always possesses the keys to what is most publicly aired and accepted as the standard. De Botton asks his readers to get in touch with their own feelings as to what is the essence of a good life, and to hold those feelings as being important. He also gives some clues on how getting in touch with our true feelings about life has been obfuscated or hijacked by others with ulterior motives who are none other then liars and crooks, often parading themselves as legitimate model citizens, and thought of as such. De Botton then gives some examples of ulterior ways of looking at the world. 

The first fourth of the book was tight and well thought out and strict to what the title claimed to cover. In the latter part De Botton seemed to wonder a bit in an ambiguous opinionate way; but in a Ruskin/organic sort of way that recognizes that some things can not be spoken of in absolutes: namely how to best steer an economy. De Botton also seemed to want to wrest Christianity back from the hands of the American plutocrats and express that societies lose a lot when they are not more egalitarian; or rather that societies lose something when its peoples feel that they can not use the same public transportation.
