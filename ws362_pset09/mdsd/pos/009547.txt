Gary's book is the right book to learn the principles for building your business, no matter what your business is or what size it is.  

Gary's book is truly about vision -- about seeing truly what the landscape is about and what it could be, and developing the right path that indeed turns that vision into reality.  Isaac Newton once remarked "Innovation is tough to sell."  Isaac Newton was a vicious optimist.  Beyond optimism is entrepreneuriality, as it takes steel-jawed resolve to create the future.  Gary's book is nothing less than a manual for creating the future.

There are great books about business philosophy, and there are great books about business execution that are very rubber-meets-the-road.
