This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn more about globalization and how the world economy is moving to a new age of information sharing.  Most of the old regimes will change as borders open up and people are able to use the internet to spur economic progress.  Thomas Friedman has a very entertaining style of writing so I recommend this book quite highly
