This review is for the revised Bantam paperback edition, August 2001.  SACRED SINS was on the USA Today top 150-bestseller list in August and September 2001, peaking at position eight.

SACRED SINS is a suspense thriller with a touch of mystery and a romantic subplot.  Dr. Tess Court, a young, attractive psychiatrist, is chosen to assist Detective Ben Paris, a handsome unattached detective, in finding a deranged serial killer.  Paris doesn't think a psychological profile of the killer will be helpful, but he finds the physical profile of Tess irresistible.  Throughout the story, the push and tug between Tess and Ben examines the treatment versus punishment of criminal dementia.

In SACRED SINS, the author switches amongst multiple points of view without separators, occasionally having two points of view in the same paragraph.  At times, I found this confusing and difficult to follow.  Otherwise, this story is well written and engaging.
