I struggled a little with the first part of this book, finding it a bit slow and technical. However the action really hots up when 'we' reach the Dordogne region of France in the mid 1300's.
It was exciting with engaging characters and plenty of twists and turns, keeping me glued to the story until the final page. 
Well worth a read.
