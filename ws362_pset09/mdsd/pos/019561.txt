Very good introduction to visual stargazing, and a required orientation to the night sky. I used to recommend the Rey book first for beginner's, but after reading this one, I'd have to give it the nod, although the candor and increased detail in the Rey book make it worth owning as well. My only gripe with this book is the liberty taken with presentation of the constellation legends, where the author felt that he needed to &quot;remove violence&quot; from the stories! A little arrogant, I thought..
