great book.  a look at love stripped to its bare essence.  Told thru the eyes of a narrator of unknown gender.  Interesting idea, and you find it doesn't really matter.  

Love transcends gender.

Many great philosophical meditations.  Do not be afraid of love.  Without it life is like a broken poem. 

the best line is about the distinction between passengers and customers.
