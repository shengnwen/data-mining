I have read several books on personal finance and investing.  However, I have never read the classic a Random Walk Down Wall Street.  I picked it up in the book store one day and realized right away it was too technical and dry for me.  Then I came across this beauty (based on the classic) and it takes the same wisdom from that book and makes it easy for people who hate the technical stuff.  I have been very successful in personal finance and it is a big hobby of mine.  I love reading these books.  This one is simply one of the best on the subject.  However, if you are one of those people who hate the idea of an efficient market and like the thrill of day trading, you will hate this book.
