Not only do I love this book for its subject--trilobites--those fascinating relatives of horse shoe crabs and wood lice--but for the gorgeous and precise language the author uses to describe everything from the murky seas that blind trilobites used to inhabit to the vast sweep of certain strata of the earth's crust with its dents and bifurcations and crenelations indicative of ice ages ancient when the dinosaurs first came into being, and strange events that wiped the evolutionary slate clean when the earth's atmosphere itself was in its infancy. Fortey takes a close look at the mechanics of trilobite vision and lets us know not only how they saw, but what kinds of things they were witness to. He also gives us a quick and easy guide to the anatomy of the trilobite, and he starts it all off by quoting from a Thomas Hardy novel!
 
 Makes you wish that Fortey was your next door neighbor and that those fascinating trilobites were still around in the back pond or in the parlor fish bowl to inspire yet another level of commentary! 
 
 All in all, a rich repast and perfect for summer reading
