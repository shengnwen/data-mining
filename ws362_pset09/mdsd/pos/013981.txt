I love watching Alex Anderson's show: Simply Quilts. I enjoyed reading the book but found some spots a bit harder to crasp the concepts than I would have liked. I figure I will try to read it again soon and with more quilting under my belt, the information will make more sense to me. I enjoyed learning more about a quilting. I have not done as much quilting as I want to. So a beginners book is a great tool for me.

Thanks Alex Anderson and your team
