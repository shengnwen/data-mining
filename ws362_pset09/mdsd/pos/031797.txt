I've read 3 Elmore Leonard books. Out of Sight,Rum Punch,and this. Every novel by Elmore Leonard i've read i'd seen the movie.This is no exception. I loved the movie so I thought,
why not read the book.The book is a little bit different from the movie but not incredibly so. The story is about Chili Palmer. Chili is a loan shark from Miami who goes to LA to collect a debt from a guy who scammed an airline and also from campy horror movie producer Harry Zimm. While talking to Harry,
Chili pitches a script idea (which Harry loves) and begins to get the low down on the movie business. Now Chili is trying to be a movie producer,and trying to convince superstar Michael Weir to be in a movie Harry wants to make called "Mr.Lovejoy".
Weir is also the ex-husband of the "love interest" of Chili,
Karen Flores.Ex-horror movie scream queen. Overall the book can drag at times and I don't really like the character of Bo Catlett but other than that this is a good book.B+.
