This is the best book I've read so far on composition. Poore doesn't deliver anything that you wouldn't find in any book on painting, but to have it all in one book is superb. Most "how to...." books on painting provide a chapter on the subject, typically a brief introduction. In the 95 pages Poore is able to delve much further covering virtually every aspect of what makes a painting look good. Topics include:
a) The importance of balance and the various things that can affect it. 
b) Entrance & Exit - getting in to and out of a picture
c) Circular observation and composition
d) Angular composition 
e) composition with one or more units
f) how to use light and shade to balance the painting
The examples are well chosen, although there were one or two that, to me, didn't get a particular concept across. The writing style is a bit dry but certainly rewards perseverence. I've given it 4 stars in the hope that the bible of composition is out there somewhere. Well worth the money and if nothing else it provides an excellent checklist for you to follow in your art.
