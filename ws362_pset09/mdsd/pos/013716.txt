After being overwhelmed by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler, I was relieved to be introduced to this fine little book that was used along with D'Inverno in my first relativity class. The accessibility of Schutz, given the advanced nature of the subject, is second to none. Each chapter includes many problems that are of a calculational nature that help you get a feel for the subject. I was really impressed with his chapters on vectors and tensors, where Schutz gives you a good feel for tensors in general and one forms in particular. His description of the covariant derivative was also very nice. Later chapters, such as cosmology and gravitational waves, didn't strike me as good as the earlier chapters. Nonetheless I definitely recommend this book to get you started with the subject.
