I have found this book to be a very helpful reference guide. There is a chart that summarize first year developmental milestones, a chapter that includes detailed information about the signs, symptoms, and treatments for the most common illnesses that babies tend to develop, advice on getting breastfeeding off to the best start, helpful advice on what to expect in terms of newborn behavior (sleep, crying, feeding patterns, etc.) The author's tone is friendly and reassuring. If you enjoyed the previous book in this series (The Mother of All Pregnancy Books), as I did, you will likely enjoy this book, too
