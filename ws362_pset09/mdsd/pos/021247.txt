My kids love this book!  They enjoy the parts where the child hugs the parent and says, "m m m . . . that's feels better."  When my 21 month old daughter sees this, she hugs the book.  Whenever I say teeth are not for biting, my five year old daughter says, "ouch, biting hurts."  My kids remember this book well and want me to read it over and over.  Your kids will learn biting hurts, what they can do instead of biting, and feel comforted receiving hugs from mom and dad.
