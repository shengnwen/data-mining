Margaret Coel has said she has her characters face great challenges in order to see what they're made of. In "The Ghost Walker," her second mystery in a series, Father John O'Malley and Vicky Holden definitely get put through the wringer, which was a bit torturous for me to read, since I have already come to care about these characters so much.

But Father John and Vicky rise to meet their respective challenges with dignity, grace and humanity. Vicky struggles to save her drug-addicted daughter from a group of men who could be killers, while Father John combats plans to shut down his beloved Jesuit mission while wrestling with his own feelings for Vicky and his alcoholism.

As far as the mystery goes, Coel once again makes it clear who the bad guys are early in the novel. Normally, this would kill any suspense, but Coel has a gift for making you want to keep reading even when she lets you in on her secrets. You want to see how all the pieces will finally fit together, and you want to further probe the motives of the villains who bring such chaos to other people's lives.

"The Ghost Walker" wasn't just a page-turning mystery. It was a top-notch, character-driven novel with two protagonists you really want to see triumph in the end
