I picked this book up at the bookstore about three years ago for my oldest son who at the time was 4 yrs old. He loved this book then and still does now.  Also his younger brother who is 3 enjoys this story. I read this to them a few times a week and don't get tired of the story myself either. They think some of the pictures are hilarious.  Would highly recommend.
