I absolutely loved this book from beginning to end. I have never read a book that I couldn't put down. It was given to me by my maternal uncle at a time when I was in need of some healing. No author has ever been able to make me see things so clearly before. This book made me laugh and cry. Ms. Altea is a very telented writer with a knack for storytelling
