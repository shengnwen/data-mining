This book is an excellent resource for Church Education staff. This book covers some basic principles (or laws as he calls them) regarding teaching in the church environment.  The law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch, as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment.  This is so true and often followed in higher education, but perhaps not very well followed in church education.  The sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning.  But according to Henricks a student must study, must come to class on time, and must be interested in the material to proactively learn.  

There is much more good stuff in this book.  Grab it its a great read
