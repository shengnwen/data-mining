is that it made me actually stop and think about all the stupid things we people sometimes do to ourselves that make us go crazy for no good reason other then our own over-exaggerating thoughts.  If we only learn to alter the way we think, the world would be a much much better place to live.  You can definitely learn a lot from this book...especially for young adolescents, this book can the teach the young very early on in life how to prepare yourself for the inevitable as they get older.  For example, I thought about this book one day while I was driving with my family on the highway during Thanksgiving Day.  There happened to be some crazy driver driving almost 90 MPH and swirving dangerously among the other cars.  All of a sudden, I made a witty remark stating, &quot;Geez, that driver must really be in a hurry to eat some turkey.&quot;  Once I said that, everybody in the car started laughing.  Instead of getting mad at the crazy driver for driving so carelessly, &quot;I&quot; chose to reinstate my thoughts about him and reaasure everybody that even an annoying situation such as that, should not bring you down unless you choose to let it bring you down
