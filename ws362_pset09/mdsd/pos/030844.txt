Capitalism improves the lives of people more effectively than any other economic system.  But the underlying principles of capitalism, efficiency and the bottom line, are too widely applied says the author.  We are exhorted nowadays to run everything, even our personal lives, like a business.  The problem is that the mandates of your life, and even many industries, like healthcare and social services, fall outside the basic structure of capitalist economics.  Capitalism can provide wealth and comfort for people and institutions, but it cannot provide a meaning to their existence.  People want more than money, says the author, they also hunger to make the best of themselves.  The answer is to become "properly selfish."  To be properly selfish means to reach beyond economics and find a true purpose to your life, to satisfy yourself by helping others, and building a legacy you can be proud of.  

Charles Handy has the following advice for those seeking to add true meaning and richness to their lives:
 Know when to say "enough."  Eventually, more wealth doesn't add value to your life, it just accumulates.
 Create the sublime.  Make room in your life for things that lift your spirit like music and art.
 Reach for immortality.  Find a way to leave something positive behind for the generations that will come after you.
 Help employees achieve their dreams.  Give them a vision, a reason to feel passionate about their work.
 Treat your employees as citizens.  Today, companies are more often a collection of people, not things
