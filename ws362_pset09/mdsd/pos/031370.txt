	The Golden Compass is probably one of the best books that I have ever listened to. I am listening to it on a CD, and what's so unique about it is that there isn't one narrator. There is a cast of people that play different voices in the book. The Golden Compass is a story about Lyra, niece of Lord Asreal. Lyra is troubled because her uncle is always having adventures in the North. Lyra badly wants to go there with Lord Asreal, but she is still too young. Read the book to discover the Aurora Borealis, Dust, and dimensions beyond our own
