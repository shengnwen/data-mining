This book was funny because there were a lot of characters who had silly names like Roliopolio and Snivelwurst. 

I liked when Charlotte found a wooden head that she named Herr Woodenkopf and carried it around everywhere. It tricked people into thinking it was someone's head and that was funny. 

I really liked Charlotte and Max and Eliza. They were the good guys. I did not like Zamiel the Huntsman, he was the bad guy and so was Count Karlstein.

I liked that everyone in the audio book has different voices so it is kind of like listening to a real show
