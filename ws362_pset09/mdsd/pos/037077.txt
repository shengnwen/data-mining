This book is for those that really want to COMMUNICATE -- not simply write or speak well. It includes over 1000 (yes I said one thousand) tips taught in 23 situational lessons. I found Booher's writing style to be conversational and easy-to-follow. After reading the book cover-to-cover, I also find it a straightforward  reference where I can &quot;look up&quot; how I might handle &quot;special&quot; circumstances. There's also a full list of all the tips in the back that I used to highlight a few goals that I want to put in practice in my professional and personal life
