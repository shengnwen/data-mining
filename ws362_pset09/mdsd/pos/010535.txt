If you are looking for a very good beginers book on african grey parrots, this book is for you. Gives great information about food, ilnessess, etc etc. I just wish it gave more information about the size of cages and other cage stuff. The pictures are great, and the book is very easy to understand. Up-to-date information is inculded which was very nice. I would recondmend this book to people who are interested in buying an african grey parrot
