This is a great book for starters for Hillary Clinton's run in 2008. Susan has transformed herself on Fox News in recent years from the flaming liberal to a sensible speaking woman. I am a conservative and I know that Hillary has a great chance to become the first woman president of the United States....mostly because most of us women...ESPECIALLY after Bill Clinton was president...are READY for a woman in the Oval Office. No one should underestimate Hillary's chances. We Republicans don't seem to have an alternative besides Condi Rice to run against Hillary...and Condi keeps saying she won't run. We don't have anyone with the name recognition. Susan Estrich wrote this book on the cutting edge of time to sell a book like this...and noticing the make over she displays on TV...she seems to think she might have a chance in a Hillary campaign and administration. Watch out all you fellow conservatives! The book makes a good case for Senator Clinton..
