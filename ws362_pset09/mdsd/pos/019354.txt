Its a whole book of colour photos throughout showing details on the 1964 1/2-65-66 model Mustangs and even Shelby Mustangs too.This is an amazing reference book for owners and enthusiasts of Ford Mustangs.

If you are thinking about restoring your mustang to its original factory condition this is the first book you should buy.This book maintains the very high standards that this publisher are known for.Finally the long awaited Mustang book is here.And it was worth the wait.
