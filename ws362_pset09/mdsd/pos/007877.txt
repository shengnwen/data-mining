This is a well written book.  Its basic theme is that democratic societies may have to, from time to time,  suspend certain rights and freedom in order to deal with threats to their citizens or their very existance.   The key presented is that these suspensions be limited by their scope in time and ultimately subject to review by the judiciary, democratic process, the public and the press.
 
   The subject of torture comes up but what I found most interesting was the discussion of how we might have to react to the threat of nuclear or biomedical terrorism.   As the cost of these technologies comes down it becomes more possible for society to be threatened by small groups or radical nations acting directly or anonymously through surrogates who would not be deterred by the threat of mutual self destruction.  

   Overall the message is that these are ethical issues that we must, even imperfectly, need to work out.  Ignatieff's book does a good job of laying out directions of discourse.   We may not get it right and we may have to even choose to do wrong for the greater good but the fact that we struggle with the question makes us a better society.
