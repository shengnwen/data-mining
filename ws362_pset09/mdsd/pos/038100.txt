I first saw James Ellroy when he was being interviewed about this book by Catherine Crier on Court TV. My heart both broke and went out to him: his mother's murder, although 10 years' after the Black Dahlia, has some similarities. This book is about his re-opening the investigation of her case, but it is more about his coming to terms with her and her murder after many years of his being lost and floundering, and his attempts to reconcile many conflicting feelings and memories of her. But most of all it is about this bravely emotional, heroic man who, despite rock-bottom suffering, faces life honestly and dead-on and reacts to it in a way that is uniquely raw, visceral, powerful, affirming, and fiercely intense, like his writing style. Unforgettable book and writer
