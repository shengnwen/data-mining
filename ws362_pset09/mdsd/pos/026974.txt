There is so much information packed into this work that it is difficult to imagine how the author and illustrator pulled it off.  This is the story of the life cycle of the loggerhead turtle.  The illustrations are beautiful and actually quite accurate.  The text is simple and very, very well done.  It follows the illustrations perfectly and is just overflowing with good information.   This book, while great for kids to read on their own (this is one of the more used books in our school library), it is also great to read to the class as a whole as it never fails to bring on good questions and good discussions (better know your turtles when faces with a bunch of third graders).
