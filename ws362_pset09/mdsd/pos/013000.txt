Yann Martel wrote a book, prior to the Life Of Pi, had trouble getting it published, eventually decided it was a terrible book, slipped the manuscript into an envelope, wrote an unknown address on it's cover -with no return address- and put it in the mail. Then he wrote the Life of Pi! An incredible book based on true events. I remained incredulous throughout the book because it seemed so far fetched, but I'm glad I held out and finished it, because it all made perfect sense in the end. One of the best books I've read in years, next to: The Long Walk, A Fine Balance, A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius, The Curious Incident of The Dog in The Night Time and A Long Way Down.
