Here is a book that I keep going back to.  It is filled with so much knowledge and wisdom.  System thinking and learning is so critical to our growth...I can't say enough good things about this book!

I own it on tape and in book form.  

This book should be required reading for everyone involved in any kind of leadership role (government, education, business, religious, etc.)
