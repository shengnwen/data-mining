The third (of 20) in the Aubrey/Maturin series of the Napoleonic wars, this novel tells of a voyage to India by Captain Aubrey and his spying friend Dr. Maturin. Along the way, poorhouse refugee Aubrey looks for a rich French prize to ease his troubled finances and Maturin's mind is fixated on an inconstant woman he anticipates finding in Bombay.           

This is the first of the Aubrey/Maturin seafaring books that I have read and I'm a bit equivocal. The character development is superb; the writing is excellent -- albeit obscure in places for this landlubber; humor, drama, and action dot the pages.  But my standard for naval adventure is the Hornblower series and I'm not yet ready to concede that Aubrey/Maturin is better. The narrative is hard to follow and the characters and incidents go by with blinding speed, leading me often to wonder: who (or what) was that? Reading the series from the beginning would help with the comprehensibility problem, so do that if possible. 

Is Aubrey really more interesting than Hornblower? Maybe he's more endearing in his blundering incompetence in everything not connected to seamanship.  And what is Maturin about on this voyage?  You can't do much spying when you spend months and months at sea.  All in all, "H.M.S. Surprise" intrigued me.  I'm inspired to read another in the series to see if I can get into the characters and the story.  I can see the possibility that I might become an Aubrey/Maturin fanatic.  But I'm not there yet.
