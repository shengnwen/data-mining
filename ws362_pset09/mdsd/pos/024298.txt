This is one of my favorite books by Nora Roberts. Setting is her specialty. She really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure. You really come to care about these characters, and it's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep-sea diving for the very first time in your life! This one earned its 5 stars!
