Swim Lessons, by Nick Irons is one of the most motivating books I've read in a long time. His fast read about his 1,550 mile swim of the Mississippi River was rejuvanating and inspirational! His easy steps to make any dream succeed are easy to use in daily life sitiuations like the work place, home life, and personal goals. Adventure, struggles, and amazing accomplishments help keep you glued to every word.  His message is awarness about MS and I can't wait to help. I LOVED IT! Great job Nick
