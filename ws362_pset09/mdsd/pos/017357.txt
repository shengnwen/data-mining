This is one of the funniest novels I have read in a while - but with black, black humour, which does seem to dilute as the story unfolds.  The first half is marvellous as Mantel cuttingly describes the primitive  village.   Fludd remains enigmatic but perhaps that is the point and I didn't think deeper about the alchemy implied.
