Every celebrity has his/her own outside and inside and we never know the last one. The "Walk this Way" is an interview book, where you can actually read the thoughts of musicians and their feelings about their lives, careers, each other and people around them.

Rock admirers will find the book interesting as it also touches upon other bands; begninners in the music will find it as their study book so not to follow the mistakes. It is not  detailed, however. Looks more like a newspaper
