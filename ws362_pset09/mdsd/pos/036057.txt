As a young reporter, Roger Kahn got to cover the Brooklyn Dodgers for two seasons.  In this book, he tells us about those two years, then goes back to visit the players several years later, describing their lives and hardships after baseball.  The sad part of the book is that the players seemed to have more than their share of bad luck after leaving the game.

It's an interesting look at the Dodgers in the early 1950's and an even more interesting look at the indiviual players as people after they retired from the game.  It also tells us a great deal about how the team was dealing with integration a few years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier
