This book is powerful--and distressing.  The Arab-American author had spent time as a journalist in Iraq before and after the invasion by Americans and British.  His fluency in the people's own language allowed him to speak with people and get first-hand experience of what Iraqis were thinking.

The primary lesson seems to be: The United States had a shot at making the successful overthrow of Saddam work, but could not pull it off.  Lack of understanding of the Iraqi cultures, inability to get electricity back on line, committing acts against the Iraqis that inflamed passion against the troops all contributed to a deteriorating situation.

Today, the United States is desperate for an exit strategy, partially as a result of a near complete misunderstanding of Iraq and its people.  What makes this book unique in comparison with others that have explored what is happening "on the ground" (e.g., Cobra II, Squandered Victory, and The Assassins' Gate) is the intimate portrait of everyday Iraqis by an author fluent in their language and conversant with their culture.

If only the American government had had the sense to bother trying to undertand that culture beforehand rather than assuming that "shock and awe" would lead to being greeted as "liberators". . . .
