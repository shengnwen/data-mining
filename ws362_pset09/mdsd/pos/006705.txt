I find myself nearly unable to read most romance novels, because the characters are just too predictable, and the writing style unoriginal.  But this romantic tale was a pleasant surprise.  I enjoyed the leisurely (but not boring) pace, the setting (early 1800's London) and especially the characters.  Please do not be put off by the ridiculously absurd cover art, because inside lies an enjoyable story about two people who love one another
