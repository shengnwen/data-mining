The Stepford Wives is a funny novel - everybody knows of it, most people have seen the movies, either the old version or the newer version, and some poor people have even heard of The Stepford Husbands, a movie which was a spin off of the older version.  Even the term, The Stepford Wife, has entered our language.
Yet how many have read the book?  At only about 123 pages it doesn't take that long to absorb.
It is interesting to watch the world unfold from the point of view of the main character, Joanna Eberhart, and to see it as a mirror image of our society.  After a few chapters you start to wonder if you are seeing the town as it is or as Joanna sees it.  Is her reality cracking or is she really in danger?  Is this science gone crazy?  Is this culture sucking in the new comers and changing them?  Or is this the beautiful American dream, the final goal of having a ideal family, the stable and stale happiness that all people wish for?
Get it used or new.  Read it at least once
