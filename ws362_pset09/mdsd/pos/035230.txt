Have been going to hot yoga classes 4-5 days a week for the past three months, so you can classify me as a novice.  What I have noticed is this book really helped me attain better form as I incorporated it into the verbal instructions given in the class.  One area I think that could be improved on, however, is all of the pictures are taken from a side view and clearly a front/back view of the positions would help.  Also, some of the text instructions are hard to decipher when it comes to understanding a position.  Overall, this book has helped my practice and I refer to it often
