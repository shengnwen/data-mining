A favorite YA author of this reader since picking up her terrific Walk Two Moons, this is the third or fourth of hers I've read.  It's a short, sweet book, but what makes it sweet also makes it not easy to understand.  That's by design.  A boy is visited by ghosts. The one this story focuses on is his uncle, not his first choice of ghosts since his father passed away not long ago.  Anyway, the ghost uncle had a stroke before dying and has not overcome the barriers of expressing himself since joining the hereafter.  He has quirky speech, consistent, but only to himself, and slowly to his nephew.  It is a paradox for the reader, too.  What DID he mean by that?  The nephew takes on helping the uncle with three requests.  He also deals with a bully who has his own issues, and the deceased uncle's wife, who has a new romantic interest  It's good, pleasant, and I'd recommend it, but it's a far cry from Walk Two Moons' wonderfulness
