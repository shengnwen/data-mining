Andrei Makine adds another laurel to his impressive writing career with the release of Requiem for a Lost Empire.  In this short book (250 pages) Makine surveys the past century of change in Russia from the fall of the Czars and the rise of the people, through Stalin and World War II, through the Cold War with its ominous KGB into today with the undercover lives of common men striving to retain the promises of Communism.  Makine does this seemingly incredible feat through the eyes of one family - sons and fathers who lived through the various phases of critical change that Russia (empire, USSR, etc) has undergone. In nonlinear fashion he draws multifacted, complex characters with flashbacks and flashforwards in a way that makes this less a  history book (though it is valuably one) than the novel it is.  And as if that weren't enough, Makine writes with a grace and poetry that suffuse his tale with lasting visuals and ominous grit.  That the author left Russia to live in France and has written all his books to date in Frence means that we are also experiencing the work of a master translator.  This little book is a gripping masterwork - highly recommended reading
