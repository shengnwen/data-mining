In this short, readable book (in part an update of Tournament of Shadows), Meyer first provides some background on imperial competition among the British, the Russians, and the Americans in Southwest and Central Asia.  Subsequent chapters describe recent history in Iran, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, and the Central Asian republics that once were part of the Soviet Union.  Meyer's writing is clear, lively, and well-informed; events are placed in context, and are illuminated with sharply observed detail.  While the discussion of issues is relatively light, this is an eye-opening introduction for those not already knowledgeable about the region
