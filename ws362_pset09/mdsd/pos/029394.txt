This is not the be-all and end-all book insofar as early Dylan photographic documentation is concerned - the recently released "The Bob Dylan Scrapbook - 1956-1966" probably deserves that award. But it has some nice, intimate photos of young Bob in his early years in the Greenwich Village folk music scene. Accompanying text provides appropriate context. Plus, my copy came with a rather nice surprise - an individual print of one of the famous Dylan-at-the-typewriter-in-his-apartment photos. Nice touch
