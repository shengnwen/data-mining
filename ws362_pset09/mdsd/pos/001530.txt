This is a brilliant, deeply thoughtful, open-hearted book, one of the ten or twelve most important studies we have so far of the culture of the United States.  Those who take the time and make the effort to read it carefully will learn a lot not only about American history and society, but also about their own private thoughts and fantasies and the background assumptions of their everyday lives.  The dismal state of American education is the main thing you can learn about in most of these reviews.  This book has limitations.  The most obvious: it's about white/Anglo middleclass Americans.  But the only sensible response to the book is still gratitude.  If you haven't read it, read it.
