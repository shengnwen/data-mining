If you live in or around the prairie areas of Oklahoma, you probably know about the diverse conditions we have and how difficult your gardening can be. Well, here's the answer. Given to me by my landscaping brother at Christmas, the Oklahoma Gardener's Guide : The What, Where, When, How &amp;  Why of Ornamental Gardening in Oklahoma has been very helpful to me, a  novice gardener at best. Full of ideas about trees, shrubs, vines and  flowers, it helped me decide what would work in my landscape.  &quot;A-Ha&quot; was my expression as I quickly discovered why things I had  tried in the past had failed. Easy to understand and accompanied by  full-color thumbnail pictures, it gave me a blueprint to go by. I even  carried my bookmarked copy to the nursery when I picked out new spring  plants and trees. The bottom line... it works. Now I'm planting with  success. This Oklahoma author has done his homework. You should benefit  from it
