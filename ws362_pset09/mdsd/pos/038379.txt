A vital part of understanding the end of the Cold War.  The book is at its most vivid and engaging during it's description of the events leading up to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification of Germany and the Gulf War.   Bush and Scowcroft tag team throughout the book and complement each other  well.  Bush's knack for incorporating anecdotes and his personal  relationships with other world leaders serves him well here.         However, the book is lacking in some areas, and I couldn't quite bring  myself to give it 5 stars.  While billed as a major part of the book, the  section on the Tianamen Square uprising in China was not particularly  detailed or illuminating.  The book could have benefited from Bush and  Scowcroft's perspective on the Panama Invasion, Somalia, and especially on  the crucial decisions on US policy towards the breakup of Yugoslavia, which  began on Bush's watch.      Still, this is an amazing book and it was easy  to feel swept up in events that many did not believe we would see happen in  our lifetime, myself included.  On par with the great books of  international relations such as Kissinger's &quot;A World Restored&quot;  and Acheson's &quot;Present at the Creation.&quot
