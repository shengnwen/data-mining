In this book, Baudrillard develops his own theory in various fields from sex, Freud, Kierkegaard, to politics in the theme of ÅgseductionÅh. Probably, this book is written to be seduction. At the same time, we can  see BaudrillardÅfs general attitude toward his works including this book:  Prediction, warning, and seduction. He seems to learn a lot of things from  KierkegaardÅfs works. In the first part, he maintains his own theory on sex  against Freud, which is different from feministsÅf theory based on sexual  difference. It is interesting that he almost predicts todayÅfs situation of  sex, which is why his works always seduce people. Moreover, I am impressed  by his comments on Japanese striptease and by his idea that Japanese sexual  culture is different from Western one. Through chapters, his point that  seduction is fatal to itself appears continuously in his skillful rhetoric:  The style of this book is similar to his ÅgSimulacra and SimulationÅh,  which is a good guidebook to read this book
