If you can get past all the extraneous material (such as the highly negative introduction and footnotes) which seem to be working overtime to make sure you *don't* like this book, you will find it to contain many truly inspiring pieces of political wisdom, put forward with a rhetorical flair and energy that keep you turning the pages, even if you may not agree with everything he states. There's nothing "tortured" about the prose at all (try reading Spengler -- there's some tortured prose for you.) Of course, Hitler was writing as an ordinary, self-educated man: he makes no claim to be an academic or even a professional writer. We must remember that this was written in 1925 while he was imprisoned for political activism. He had served bravely in the disastrous Great War of 1914-1918, was severely wounded, no doubt saw many of his buddies killed on the front lines -- only to come home to economic and political chaos and despair. That would be enough to make any man highly angry and bitter. But Hitler didn't just sit around and mope, he did something about it; he became active in politics and put forward a philosophy that, though it has its detractors, is still "controversial" eighty years later. And despite the hypocrisy of those who publish this book (repeating how badly written it's supposed to be), it's still a worldwide bestseller, so *someone* must be reading it. And the publishers don't mind cashing the checks either -- if they were sincere they would put it into the public domain and wash their hands of it. BTW: go for the new black cover edition -- it's a huge aesthetic improvement over that really ugly old orange edition
