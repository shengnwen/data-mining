The problem with this book is that it simplifies and doesnt crasp some of the true lessons we could learn from Alexander. 
However, the book gives a excellent account about his life and battles. I think that you should buy this book if you are intrested in alexander from a learning standpoint. I learned a few things from this book! But if you want to learn alexanders leadership style, then try find another book
