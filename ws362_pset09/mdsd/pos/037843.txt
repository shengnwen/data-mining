This book really saved my but when it came to spanish. I was a senior and going into spanish 4 and I was very behind on EVERYTHING. I had just moved to a new school and met a real spanish teacher who could teach and I learned that my old teachers where stupid in comparison. I was about to drop the class when my mom got this for me. I learned so much. Not just the regular stuff like present, future, and past but all kinds of tenses that you use in spanish. It also doesn't just show you it, it gives lots of details on when and how you use those tenses and also practice problems with answers in the back. AND on top of all that it teaches you HUNDREDS of useful verbs and vocabulary that are used every day in spanish and things like how to say "I am hungry" Now to most english people that seems simple. You use the "to be" verb and add on hungry but that isn't how you use it. FIrst off in spanish there are 2 verbs for to be and you know what? Neither is used for that. You say "I have hunger." Many people mess this up including me but I known Know the right way and havent messed up yet. Trust me it teaches you hundreds andhundreds of stuff and I PROMISE YOU you will not regret this book
