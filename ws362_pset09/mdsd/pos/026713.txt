This book is about the tale of Salamanca and Phoebe, with their disappearing mothers. Salamanca tells her grandparents about this tale when she was suck with them for 6 days to visit her mother. I like this book as it has suspense, creativity and consistent. This book should definitely be published.
I think that the author is able to engage the reader and make the reader have suspense. The author tells the story bit by bit, stopping at the appropriate time and returning the reality. This is so as she wants the reader to want to continue reading.
I feel that Sharon Creech is very creative as she manages to effectively put two different lives together, making the story more interesting. Using this method, she is able to let the story have comparison between how Salamanca and Pheobe felt when their mothers left them.
The author is very consistent as throughout the book, she portrays Salamanca as a stubborn and a person that values love and friendship, while she portrays Pheobe as a worrywart and a person that is very defensive of her family.
Again, I recommend you to publish this book. I believe that many people will enjoy reading this book. I would like to read the book again if I have the chance to do so. I enjoyed every minute of reading that book.
