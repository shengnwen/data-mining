I originaly came across Goose Girl  and loved it so i decided to see if there was a sequel and there was, Enna Burning the book is about one Isi's best friends, Enna, and what happens after her mother dies and she has to deal with her brother. He some how gets the power of learning the language of the fire and suddenly dies in battle. Now Enna has the fire language and while spying gets kidnaped. Once she is back in the casle with Isi and Geric, Isi says that she must jorney to land of the fire speakers and learn how to control her fire. So Enna and Isi go not telling Geric that they will be gone over 3 weeks. In the end Enna learns how to control her fire and also that Isi is expecting. So they must jorney back to the casle before the baby arives (Geric doesn't know that Isi is pregnant) the story ends with Isi and Geric's baby being born
