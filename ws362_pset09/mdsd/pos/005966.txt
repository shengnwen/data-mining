This book was so quaint because it talked about life on a mountain farm back 60 years ago.  The  characters were interesting-some were downright gross; others you had to completely feel sorry for-like Ma Kettle.  The writer did an outstanding job vividly describing the wild animals, farm work, and entertainment of these remote areas!!  I found the ending to be a surprise though.  The book is nothing like the Ma and Pa series of movies, however
