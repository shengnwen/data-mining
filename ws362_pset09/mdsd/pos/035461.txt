I enjoyed this book.  Yes some of the normal vampire myths didn't apply and I would have liked a little more explanation to that, however I enjoyed the overall heat and excitement between the two main characters.

If you like this book you will also enjoy "The Silver Fang" By Tamara Gray.  Another Fantastic Rea
