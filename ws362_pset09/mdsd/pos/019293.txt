Being a huge fan of drive-ins, I really looked forward to reading this book.  The only criticism I have is the sequence of the actual chapter text of the book, and the information inserts that the author has throughout.  It is very &quot;chopped&quot; up.  Reading the chapter, then turning the page to find there is information pertaining to something else on the next page. The chapter text starts a couple of pages later in some cases, breaking up the continuity.  Other than this, it makes for a very interesting read for those who enjoy nostalgia and want to be transported back to a more simpler and fun time
