The authors did an incredible job on getting the information for the book--I salute them, but I am kind of disappointed in the book.  The magic used is not to me so magical, but more like prayers, actually (it seems to me, but someone else rightfully might disagree with me).  I am not a practicing Christian magician, so that might influence how I feel about the book.  The book, however, makes a great collection item for my magical library.  I say go ahead and buy the book at least to get a good idea of christian magic
