Elizabeth George is a prolific writer. Her series featuring Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner, Barbara Havers has been made into a television series.  It was for this reason that I read her latest in the Lynley-Havers series.  It is certainly the best so far. This is a long book, but it never gets bogged down.  Lynley and Havers, along with newly promoted Detective Sargeant Winston Nkata, investigate a serial killer who kills and mutilates adolescent boys.  Nkata deals with a reluctant love interest, Havers with a deepening friendship with her neighbor, and Lynley with a family tragedy while pursuing this high profile murder case. George has woven this all together into a moving, beautifully written story
