This volume has two wonderful aspects, it contains the primary philosophical thought of the most important modern European philosophers (excepting the British Empiricists, such as Locke, Berkeley and the  incomparable David Hume), and it is published by the Modern Library.  This  book is hardback, well binded and printed on good paper that stands up to  underlining and margin scribbling.  For a real hoot, read Kant's serious,  calculated, sober and nearly incomprehensible philosophy, and then read  Nietzsche with all his ! 's at the end of virtually every sentence.   Wonderful
