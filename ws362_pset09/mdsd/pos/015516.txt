As Eva records in her writer's notebook she believes she has nothing to write about.  Her colorful neighbors, however, prove this to be quite far from the truth.  Each rich character offers sound writing strategies that  Eva applies to her writing.  A lonely retired actor encourages her to look  for the details all around.  The prima ballerina who never smiles invites  Eva to stretch her imagination.  Mrs. Martinez advises Eva to add spice to  her writing as she does to her Mexican soup.  Mr. Morley suggests she ask  herself, &quot; What if?&quot;  All the events add up to a story that Eva  has recorded for all to enjoy.   An additional benefit is the new business  created as a result of hilarious circumstances.  Writing teachers will  return to this delightful story again and again to encourage children to  try the same stratgies in their own writing
