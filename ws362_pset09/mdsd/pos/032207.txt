I was surprised that no one has written this book before.  Everyone knows some know-it-all who just HAS to have the last word in any conversation about music.  

Like Dean, this dude who was my shift supervisor at the AutoZone.  I remember putting "2112" on the tape player in the garage, and Dean lectured us for 10 minutes about how Ginger Baker and Mo Tucker were better drummers than Neal Peart from Rush (which is total b.s.), and rambled on about some "brilliant" Syd Barrett solo album that no one ever heard about.  And whenever "Teenage Wasteland" came on the radio, Dean couldn't help himself from making sure we all knew that the song was really called "Baba O'Reilly".  We were changing the coolant on an Impala one day and the owner had left "Metal Machine Music" and a Captain Beefheart CD on the dashboard, and old Dean just about went nuts.  When the Impala owner came to pick up his car, you would have thought Dean was meeting his long-lost twin that the hospital separated at birth.  

Anyway, there's definitely someone like Dean who was your annoying freshman roommate, a chick you used to date, or you, so this book is awesome.  Especially if you spend a lot of time on the can, since this book is broken down into bite-sized nuggets and doesn't require more than 2 minutes of attention at any given time.  Rock on.
