This is my second Hard Case Crime novel and I'm hooked.  These short, easy to read novels are full violence, sex and gritty murder mysteries.  This novel is from author Ed McBain, written in the 1950s when $10,000 in life insurance was worth killing over.

Matt Cordell is drinking himself into the grave over the adultery committed by his ex-wife Toni.  A childhood friend asks Matt to lookover some thefts being committed at his Tailor shop.  At the shop, they find the dead body of his partner.  From their, Cordell, an ex PI tries to find the killer while negotiating the underside of NYC and staying one step ahead of the police.

This is a fun novel where the women are hot and sultry and none of the men can be trusted.  I'll definitely check out more HCC books in the future
