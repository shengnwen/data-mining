Treasure by Clive Cussler was much better then the other Dirk Pitt novels I read. However this would probably not be the same opinion of the others who read this book because I liked this book better because it focused on an earlier timeperiod then the other books I read.

This story revolves around the US trying to stop radicals from taking power of Egypt (by an Islamic extremist) and Mexico (by someone who wants to bring the Aztecs back in power). Dirk Pitt must stop this while looking for a stash of secret scrolls that were taken from the Library of Alexandria before it was destroyed.

I enjoyed the history lesson in this book and couldn't put this book down. I would suggest this Dirk Pitt book to people who enjoy a mix of action and older history
