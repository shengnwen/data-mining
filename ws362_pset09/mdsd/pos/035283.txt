"A Time to Kill" is definitely Grisham's best novel.  It's interesting that it was Grusham's first novel, but it was rejected for publication until after some of his other novels were published.  The story deals with a number of issues that all intertwine seamlessly.  Racism, murder, justice, revenge, law and order, etc.  The story will hold you from start to finish.  Most of Grisham's newer novels are simple, predictable stories that bash attorneys.  That is not the case with "A Time to Kill".  It will grip you, tear you and entertain you all at the same time
