I just finished the extremely stressful process of taking SATs and applying to college. 

I wanted to review this book and post my thoughts online in an effort to help others going through the same thing.

I really liked this book.  It didn't try to teach me anything i didn't need to know.  It was very straight forward and provided excellent example tests that really helped me practice.  All these standarized tests are just about learning the question types, and the only real way to do that is to do questions over and over again.  The more the better, and this book definitely gives you enough to work with.

After using this book, I got a great score on my SATs.  Coupled with my excellent admissions essay, I got into my top choice schools.  ( I had my essay edited by EditorExchange.com )...

All the stress is over now, and I can't wait to start classes next fall
