Claire Cloninger and Laura Barr have written a powerful &quot;little&quot; book about being &quot;Faithfully Fit&quot;....I began reading it each day  and 17pounds later I continue to &quot;reread&quot; it....just wish it was  for 365 days of the year.  I learned so much about how to change my  thinking.  Not only on the foods I choose but also how God looks at us as  &quot;whole&quot; people - body, mind and spirit.  I highly recommend this  book for motivation and &quot;correct thinking&quot; in acheiving the  &quot;Temple&quot; God desires for us
