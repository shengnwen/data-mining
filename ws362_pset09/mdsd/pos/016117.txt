very short book....takes about 5-6 hours to read...the CD forget it...its crap...so hard to use and unclear...and if your using this book for USMLE 1, the CD is useless...but the text will help consolidate some of the facts in FIRST AID...the depth of the material is appropriate for usmle 1...over all its a good inexpensive book...and cleared up a lot of stuff i ddin't understand in my neuro course...
