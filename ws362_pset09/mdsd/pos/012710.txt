A well-written book examining the controversial gay movement and subsequent religious right movement in the 90s.  The authors write in an anthropological style, representing both sides without displaying their personal disposition.  This style of writing is very helpful when trying to establish a position on this controversial issue, or when examining the stance opposing your own position.  For a novice in the issue of the religious right versus the gay movement this would be a wonderful starting point.  A reader that has an established position on the issue, they may like a more pro-stance work
