This, like Rash's other books, was a great read.  Through the characters in the book, readers not only get a great story, but a real insight into the region as well.  It's like taking a backstage tour into the life of the characters.  I would recommend this, and any other of Rash's books, to people who like more than just a great plot, you get the whole story.
