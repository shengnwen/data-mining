The World that Jones Made is an early book in PKD huge production. In its frame there are resonances from Sartre and Kerouac. From the first, the deep and frightful knowledge of human acts futility: everything is written and immutable. From the second the angst that pursue many intellectuals in the late Fifties.
 PKD constructs a disheveled post catastrophe world that imposes its fearful traits upon the reader. On this background the story of Jones, a foreseer that evolves from a fortuneteller to a religious messianic leader, is seen from the eyes of Cussick, a security agent that tries to stop him. Cussick represents the new establishment: the Relativists. They are trying to create a new utopia, but as many other utopist of the real world they are molding an universe without freedom and creativity. The answer that PKD gives to this is nihilism.
A dark yet captivating novel from a great writer that is trying his own mettle.
