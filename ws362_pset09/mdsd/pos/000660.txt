An absolutely superb book. Good for anyone already in a Shamanic path or for someone who knows nothing about it.

Hank and Jill's explanations of the material are first rate. 

The accompanying CD and suggested exercises are very useful.

I would recomend this book to anyone wanting to know and/or experience more of Shamanism
