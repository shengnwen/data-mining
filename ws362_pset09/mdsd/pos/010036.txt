I am not sure how I should classify ON WRITING. It is part memoir, part guide or manual, and part autobiography. As a reader, this book entertained me. As a writer, this book empowered me. 

In a conversational tone, King gives lessons and encouragement to beginner writers and struggling writers in this book. But he manages to do so while telling his incredible story of hard work, disappointment, success, and his tragic and almost fatal accident. This is a book not only for aspiring writers like myself. It also a book that any King fan must read or anyone that appreciates a good story.
