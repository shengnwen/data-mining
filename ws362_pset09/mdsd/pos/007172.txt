  The Grim Grotto has Violet, Klaus and Sunny aboard a submarine where a crazed Captain is obsessed with finding the sugar bowl before Count Olaf. While Klaus starts getting close to the Captain's stepdaughter Fiona. She's a book a worm too, well when it comes to learning about mushrooms. One of the funnier parts has has her stepfather alreday planning their wedding and having the two blushing. While saying "and Violet can marry my stepson once we find him again, Aye!". The book has it's slow points but it's still one of the best of the books since it has some surprises. Plus when Sunny gets poisoned by a deadly mushroom, Klaus and Violet have to figure out how to cure her and get away from Count Olaf at the same time. 

   Olaf is surprisingly about as whacky as Jim Carrey played him this time around. He introduces many new goofy laughs and is harder to take serious this time around. The books had a better and more sinister Olaf than the movie until I read this book. He seems to get more and more annoying as the books go on anyway and he's certainly his most annoying here. The book is still creative and the most intriguining enough for me to strongly recommend it. I honestly liked it more than most of the books.
