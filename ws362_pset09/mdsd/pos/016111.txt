The story of Abraham marks the emergence in human history of monotheism, and idea that represents a major shift in human consciousness. For believers in a single deity, it's an idea whose simplicity gives it an integrity that is self-evident. Three thousand years later, the complexity of not one but myriad Abrahams confounds understanding of the one God he believed in. 

Feiler's informative book gives us in broad brushstrokes an account of how that transformation took place. His search for common ground between competing belief systems takes him on a perplexing journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land, where he interviews men and women who have devoted their lives to study of God and the descendants of Abraham. The answers he gets to his questions illuminate his subject and raise even further questions.

At first I didn't think I was going to like this book. I expected something scholarly, and this seemed more like magazine writing - breezy and superficial. Then as Feiler wades into deeper theological and political waters, the subject became compelling and full of unexpected surprises. I recommend this very readable book for readers with even a passing knowledge of Abraham, the ancestral father of three world faiths, and who wonder at the current ferocity of religious beliefs that haunts our days
