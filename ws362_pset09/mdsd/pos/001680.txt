I highly recomend this book to readers of all ages.  Not only is it one of the funniest books i have ever read, it also contains many good methods to sleep better, relax, and most importantly, have fun.  The book is true to its title, there are many safe and healthy ways to get a rush of  adrenaline, or, just the opposite.  There are several full chapters and  several partial chapers dedicated to learning how to reduce stress, which  is definitly something that most of us need.  Another feature of this book  is that it tricks kids into learning new things and encouraging a good life  style without the feeling of a textbook.  I would highly recomend this book  to anyone looking for a good, educational, fun, and most of all,  entertaining read
