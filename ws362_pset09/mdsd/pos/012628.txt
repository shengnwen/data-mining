Rick Steves' phrasebook was my best friend during a recent three- month tour of Europe.  This book is perfectly written for the budget traveler with clear pronounciations and slices of Rick Steves' humor that his readers have come to love.  The book even includes a bit of a &quot;script&quot; for reserving a hotel room over the phone by including the exact phrases in the logical order.  Thanks to the book, I was able to eat well in Nice, sleep cheap in Provence, chase the casanovas away in Florence and much more.  Overall, this book is probably not essential for those who are only traveling in major cities where travelers are apt to find plenty of English spoken.  However, this book is a bible in small towns where no English is spoken.  In addition, the book helped me to show most locals that I was taking an interest in their language and not making the assumption that others could speak mine.  As a reward, I believe that people were more helpful, more likely to carry on a conversation with me and, when applicable, more likely to respond in English.  This was especially true in Paris
