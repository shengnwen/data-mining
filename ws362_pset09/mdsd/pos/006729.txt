The Haunting of Hill House has to be one of the best written books I have ever read.  The prose alone makes it recommendable reading.  It is clean, economical and yet certainly artistic.  The story is compelling and keeps you interested all the way through.

This novel, like many other Shirley Jackson titles, explores the themes of alienation and loneliness.  Eleanor, the main character, has lived a life of privation and the first nice thing that happens to her is that she gets invited to Hill House for a summer of paranormal exploration.  I think the novel hinges on Eleanor's search for a home.  She wants to belong somewhere.  In the end, she finds a scary way to remain at Hill House that you will just have to read about for yourself
