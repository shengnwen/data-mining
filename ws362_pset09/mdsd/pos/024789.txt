     The book Next Man Up by John Feinstein is an awesome book.  It details his journey as he spent an entire year in the Baltimore Ravens locker room.  He cites specific details that make the book so wonderful.  He touches on specific players, coaches, management, relationships, and personnel decisions.
     This book appealed to me immediately because it is about my favorite sport, football.  I would like to hold a position in an NFL team's management someday; so for me, this book was both an entertaining read, and a future wish come true.  This book, which most of his books do, reaches out to a broad audience, football fans.  I found out about this book through reading his otherf popular books.
     Overall I think I would give this book an 8.5 out of 10.  It was a great read and I plan to read all of his other books, even though this was not his best work by far
