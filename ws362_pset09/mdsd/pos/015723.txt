David Copperfield has ever remained a Best Read and it reflects Charles Dicken's own Life. It's a simply great story, romantic but also realistic and believable. It excites all emotions, from rib tickling laughter to tears of pity. Most of the qualities like modesty, frankness, trustworthiness, honesty, goodwill are the ones we admire and his frailties are understandable and endearing. 

If Charles Dickens was alive, he would be pleased to know that a story which shows, "the principle of Good surviving through adverse circumstance" has remained so popular. Charles Dickens Books are great Picks especially to gift to kids in February as Charles Dickens Birthday falls on 7th Feb
