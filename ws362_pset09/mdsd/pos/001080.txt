I must say that the New Hermetics is a really fantastic Book. It's a shame that some people seem to mistake simplifying the mysteries with being too basic or even confused. This book is anything but basic. It teaches you all the necessary steps to take on the inward journey to enlightenment in a clear and concise way. I recommend it completely. So many other books waste time with verbal mush and arbitrary non-essentials. The New Hermetics cuts through all that and just delivers the specific mental strategies for getting to transcendent consciousness and balancing your life along the way. This is the soul's journey, laid out in an easy to understand way. If anyone thinks these exercises are too basic, they are probably looking to create confusion and complexity for themselves, rather than real self-discovery
