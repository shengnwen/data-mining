This is style that is not that hard and due to stovetop adaptation, one can have the healthy benefits as well as unique smokin' flavor.  This aid and recipe collection will aid that immensely.

Styler was on FoodNetwork showing this off, caught my eye and appetite.  He has great recipe breath here: even scrambled eggs and soups and salads, to what one typically associates with smoking: ribs, sausage, chicken, fish, etc.  Favorites thus far include: Smoked Salmon Pate; Phyllo Pastry Tartletts with Smoked Shrimp and Spinach Filling; Turkey-Mushroom Barley Soup; Tea-Smoked Duck with Asian Slaw; Tea-Smoked Shrimp and Asparagus Stir-Fry.

Only way to make this even more exceptional and useful would be "sources" listing and color photos.  The latter would certainly heighten the price
