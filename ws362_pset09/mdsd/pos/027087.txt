This book would be best described as a quick, fascinating read. It is a historical book, showing off one of the less flattering periods of world history. It's well written, interesting, and draws the reader in quickly.

I won't say the plot, because quite frankly, it can't be explained. I can only recommend it wholeheartedly and hope that you realize that this is a book worth reading. The whole historical aspect mingled the with interesting characters and the good writing makes this book worth even more. The characters are interesting and though they are not exactly characters you fall in love with, they're characters that leave you with a sense of curiousity and intruige. They are almost characters to watch. The story rushes along, and there is no "boring" moment. 

It's a four and not a five for two reasons. The first is that I had trouble understanding who was who at the beginning. It got a bit confusing when people were just referred to vaguely and not directly. The seconod reason is that the sense of frustration I experienced at the end of the book. I wasn't entirely sure that I was sure of what had happened, and that was a little annoying. However, ignoring these extremely small points I find myself inviting you to read this great book. Buy it, check it out from the library, borrow it from a friend... I honestly couldn't care less about your method of obtaining the book. All I care about is you reading this cool "tale" and being introduced to one of the most interesting (and bloody) classics of all
