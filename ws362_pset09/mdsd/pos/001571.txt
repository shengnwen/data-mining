Kershaw may just have risen to the arena of one of my favorite authors. I will wait until I read another of his books before finalizing that statement. However, this book really enamoured me to him via his writing style.

I am not a reader who picks apart military history for acuracy and the like. I want a "feel" for the time and events. I read for the enjoyment of the content and the author's writing style. This book scores well on both counts. Kershaw tells the story of this group of soldiers and the events that unfolded around them during the lead up to Battle of the Bulge. It reads much like a novel and I blew through this book in two nights! It reads that easy.

I have read every WWII book written by Ambrose and he is my favorite author of this genre. However, I must confess that I enjoyed reading Kershaw's book even more than Ambrose's and that is saying alot coming from me.

If you want an account of the Bulge and susequent prison camp experience from the perspective of an individual group of soldiers and want something that you can read easily, then this is defintely a book you will enjoy. You will get a good sense of what it was like during  this time from the soldier's perspective. I liked it so well that I am now ordering his previous book "The Bedford Boys" without even bothering to thumb through it at my local bookstore as is my habit prior to ordering a book
