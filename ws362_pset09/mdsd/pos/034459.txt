OK, for me the story itself here was at best, OK - something that one could have dreamed up by sitting in a hotel lobby one winter day and making up stroies for the people you observe passing by.  It reminded a bit of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway in style.  What impressed me was Ali Smith's gift for writing.  At times the book reads more like a poem than a novel.   Her observations of the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings that her characters undergo is breathtakingly realistic.  You can literally see/hear/smell/feel it in your mind as you read.  Her musings on death and on life as a series of frozen moments is bound to send the reader into long periods of contemplation on finality.  Her characters seem like people we know or have seen.   She is a truly gifted writer
