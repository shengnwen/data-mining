One copy is at my bedside.  One copy is in my study scrawled with notes, quotes and notations!  I found the second copy at a bookstore bargain table! I didn't even blink, it was bought by me.  I knew a second copy would give me one to share.  This book is what Kabbalah is.  An amazing book. Simply, amazing
