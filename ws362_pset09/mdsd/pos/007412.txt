The author's enthusiasm for crazy quilting is quite apparent as she writes with great passion.  This is not your ORDINARY crazy quilt book.  Most embellishments are machine stitched and the fabrics used are bold and vibrant.  The projects shown are purses, lampshades, throws, and more.  What is especially wonderful is the gallery.  My favorites - the crazy quilted window treatment, the upholstered crazy quilted chair and the dog bed!  The author's instructions are very clear. Her pictures are wonderful! I am very happy with the book and would recommend it, aside from the great projects and patterns it also makes for great eye candy
