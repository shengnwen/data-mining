This imaginary guide to Paris is full of surreal imagination that will just make you smile.  Helpfully divided up into sections on hotels, restaurants, the nightlife, sights, etc., you'll read about places and services you've never dreamed of!  What a shame, they don't really exist!  Peppered thoughout the text are helpful French expressions translated into English such as &quot;Do you have a ladder so I can reach your airmail clerk suspended from the ceiling?&quot;  You can read some guest comments for the hotels which of course, are also bizarre, and learn about special services such as a kidnapping service or a food tasting service (so you don't get poisoned).  The book has some quotes from real people too and the lavish artwork gives it an other worldly feel.  It will transport you immediately to a wonderful alternative reality Paris
