This book, "How Networks Work" is a basic overview of how a typical computer networking apparatus functions. As everything goes online these days, computer networking has truly become a way of life. And, there are fewer better ways to get initiated than acquiring and dissecting (the contents of) this well-written book.
Beginners are its primary audience. Hence, it is understandable that advanced learners are often pissed-off by its rather elementary lacklustre approach to relatively complex issues. Still, this seventh edition did a good job in explaining how high-speed networks are revolutionizing businesses and entertainments.
Using easy-to-follow presentations and narrations, the author of "How Networks Work" unmasked the mysteries shrouding both client and server hardwares. The same treatment applies to network operating systems, LANs and WANs, as well as DSL and ISDN connections. It also dealt with all the basics of business/enterprise network requirements and maintainance: including broadband, routers, integration, encryption, and security concerns.
In a nutshell, this book parades all the essential ingredients, which any newbie would need in order to gain solid foundation in computer networking and security
