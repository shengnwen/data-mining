The plot has already been mentioned. So I will just give my impressions on the quality of the book. This is so much better than the some of the  books by Grisham, Crichton, Clancey et al that I was reminded of Forsyth and Le Carre. At the same time it strangely felt like the series 24 (which also I enjoy).

The book is strong on the plot and doesn't rely on ridiculous twists. The characters do not constantly wisecrack. Although there is some stereotyping, we also are presented with what each character thinks, and that helps sketch a complete portrait.

There is no constant action, our hero doesn't get in impossible situations at the end of every chapter and escape miraculously. It's a smartly written novel that grips you and forces you to finish it quickly. The plot slowly builds towards climax, much like a Le Carre novel. The mental chess games between the characters are nowhere near Le Carre/Forsyth level, but the tempo is similar. Along the route there are detours where the author gets a chance to showcase his insightful research or takes time to introduce a person and makes the book more interesting. Again not at the Forsyth skill level but very close in style.

There are weak points. I really wish there was no romantic angle between Exley and Wells. Pacing was a bit uneven. But I think the negatives are minor and very much ignorable.

There are many lines/observations that will make you chuckle as they hit right home. Berenson writes like a seasoned author. This is a fabulous debut. Reading this is time well spent. I am definitely looking forward to next book by the author
