After reading some of her latest books, i.e., Impossible, and being EXTREMELY disappointed, I reluctantly picked this one up, hoping for the good old Danielle Steel books that she used to write.  Thank goodness.  Malice is an excellent story.  Grace went through so much and yet held her head up.  From prison life to fighting off the creeps she would end up working with, she never lost sight of her goals and made it through.    Unlike the book, Impossible, I easily finished this to the end and enjoyed every page.  I just wish Ms. Steel would still write books like this one!!  I definitely recommend it!
