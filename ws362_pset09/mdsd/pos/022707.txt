It has been a very long time since I read this book, but I remember loving it as a child.  I don't think I have read any other novel in my life as many times as I have read this book.  I remember when I was really little, my mom would read it to my sisters and me at least once or twice a year.  As we got older, we read it on our own.  The copy we have at home is in such bad shape that I am sure not all the pages are even there.  I plan to get a new copy.  This will be a well-loved book.  I can guarantee that
