Hersh does a commendable job with his research. He certainly doesn't lack for sources, and the evidence gathered DOES show that JFK and company acted questionably on any number of occasions. However, his treatment of Kennedy is a bit one-sided.

I'm very much a "Warts and All" person when it comes to Presidential evaluations...and JFK obviously had more than his share of those. My problem with "Dark Side of Camelot" is that one may get the impression that Kennedy never did anything for reasons outside of personal gain, at ANY cost; that he and his administration were completely incompetent and unethical, and that whatever "successes" were achieved were done so through random "dumb luck".

I've never subscribed to the "Camelot" view of the Kennedy Presidency. However, Hersh paints JFK, his family and administration as a mix of Stalin, Machiavelli and Caligula. 

Again, it was an excellent read...just a little too biased in my opinion.
