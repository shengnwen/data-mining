This novel opens in 2296, about a year after Kirk's death/disappearance.  Spock is now captain of Intrepid II and is summoned to assist an old friend, David Rabin.  The two had met many years before on Vulcan.  The novel jumps between to two encounters which have many similiarities.  

The action is intense throughout the book, depictions of both the new and familiar characters is handled well.  For Spock fans (which should be just about everyone reading this book) it is a feast of background information on his teenage years and decision to enter the Academy.  

The main flaw, in my opinion, was that it drug on a bit.  I think that it would have been better if it were about 50 pages shorter.

The same authors also wrote VULCAN'S HEART two years later, which contains references to this novel
