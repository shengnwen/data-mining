While the story starts out rather conventionally, the wee free men are a wonder, and the world you are drawn into is far more interesting, delightful and sophisticated than I expected. 

This is not simple fantasy, it is a brilliant adventure in a consistent magical alternative world with a young resourceful, brave, wise girl assisted by impish companions she does not fully understand. 

My ten year old daughter and I are enjoying this beyond measure, and can't wait to read more.  Highly recommended
