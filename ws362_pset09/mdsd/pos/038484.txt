this is the first hiaasen book that i read and i was impressed. most lines were witty and hiaasen is one natural satirist :) even though there are plenty of characters with intertwined lives, i never got lost and i believe almost all of them were given enough space for the character to evolve. i have acquired more of his books here in Manila and i can't wait to read them
