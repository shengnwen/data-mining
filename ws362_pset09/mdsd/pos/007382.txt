Have you ever wondered what will happen during and after the rapture? Well this book takes a look at the rapture through the eyes of those who are left behind after God vacuums up all the righteous people with an 800 horse power whisper quiet shop-vac. 

The main characters include an airline pilot, his daughter, a journalist, a flight attendant, and a new world leader with devilishly good looks and charm. The main characters are all intelligent people who are trying to figure out what happened to there loved ones and what that great sucking noise was right before a third of the populace vanished. The people left behind theories seem to include alien abduction, spontaneous combustion, and God. But since all the righteous religious people are gone they are a little fuzzy on the god theory.

The book is entertaining enough, but it is mostly build up with no satisfactory release; a bit of a tease if you will. For my money I want something a little more satisfying, like a manwich or a 16 oz steak of a story. In the beginning there does seem to be the promise of steak but all you get in the end is a tiny greasy vegetarian appetizer and a bill for $ 14.99.
