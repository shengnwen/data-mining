The Dollhouse Murders is an excellent book for upper elementary/early middle school readers that provides mystery, chills and some real life lessons.
The book is a very fast easy read at about the fifth grade level and has characterizations, plot and atmosphere worthy of an adult book.  There are wonderful subplots about dealing with a mentally disabled sibling as well as the burdens of guilt.  The title may turn off male readers but if they give the book a try they will be rewarded with a story more spine-chilling than anything a certain "Goosebumps" series offers
