After raising three children and hoping you did and said the right thing along comes a book that would have made it easy to have those talks.  I now have grandchildren and helping them by sending this book to their parents will make life a whole lot easier.  I can remember one son at the age of 12 asking about masturbation.  I don't remember my response but having this book back then would have opened up a meaningful dialogue.  Kudos to the authors
