Doctor Zhivago is a dramatic tragedy that, in a world of disaster and misfortune, reminds humanity of its' most enduring traits and precious ability to endure through catastrophe even when survival may be bleaker than if it could simply put an end to its' endless cycle of futility. 
Pasternak's work covers a genre that has been lost in our society's infatuation with apathy for the human condition and sacrifice of self-insight for the comfort of purely optimistic media. The art of tragedy that was so important to our understanding of our selves has been lost in contemporary literature. It is extremely healthy for humanity to be reminded of and critically reflect on tragedy, for it is in catastrophe that humanity reveals its primordial characteristics. Pasternak wonderfully explores this human tragedy by following the life of Yurii Zhivago through the calamity of the Russian revolution. It is a story of a man desperate to hold on to his loves as the world brutally tears them from his grasp. Through relentless misfortune Zhivago loses comfort, home, and love, left bare to confront his changing life but fervently clinging to his past, ripping his soul and dying of a broken heart. 
The disaster of Doctor Zhivago makes this novel a tragedy but it is tragedy's tendency not to suffocate humanity but to encourage its' best. Zhivago is survived by his three daughters; the promise of survival, they are the life that springs from tragedy; destined for futility but forever hopeful. Humanity harbors an incredible ability to endure tragedy, and in its grimmest state, not only to survive, but survive with hope. This hope, however foolish, preserves humanity and lets it continue stumbling not forwards, nor backwards, but simply stumbling on. Doctor Zhivago rekindles peoples' love of tragedy so civilization can retain a beautifully romantic faith in fortune's wheel
