Behind You is a book that is depressing, yet one of the most happily written books I've ever read. The story of this marvelous book begins with a young teenage boy Jeremiah seeing his dead body from the after-life after being shot by two cops when they mistake him for a criminal. A lot of people know Jeremiah, and every one of them is affected by his death in  different ways.
 Now normally, I would take my time reading a book like this simply because of how depressing it becomes, but not only will you keep reading Behind You, you will read it about five times. The book has a way of sucking you into the atmospheric world that Jacqueline Woodson has created, and even when it feels like there is no reason to go on, you'll still keep reading because of the hope you have that something good will happen. 
There are a few flaws like how the author takes you through the perspective of multiple characters. It's a good idea, but you never really get to know each of the characters that well. Also the book is pretty short. Besides that, this is a must have for those of us who find every day life dull. Treasure it, take care of it. It's smart, it's original, and it breaks your perspective on how life works. It, in short, is a masterpiece that makes reading worth reading. The book isn't the best thing out there, but it comes pretty close.
