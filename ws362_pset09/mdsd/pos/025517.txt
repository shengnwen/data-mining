This book was long but I am pretty glad I read it. Although it was long it was well done. There are long stretches of conversatation or internal monolugue that put me to sleep then there were scenes that were so heart wrenchingly beautifully written I almost couldn't breathe. Also, the ending is great, it really tied up nicely. The characters were real and believable, sad and complicated. I feel as if I have an understanding of Army life after living with this book for so long, not that it interests me much, but Jones did a great job of drawing the picture
