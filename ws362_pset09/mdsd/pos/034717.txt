You will find here an ingenous legacy...I mean the translation as a gift, and a bridge, a well done bridge between old Russia and America. Nabokov's creative translation is something more than ...being Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin for a while. This a not little chance to get a green card to the  treasury of the russian country. This is simple a ticket to Russia for  everybody, and of first class, which think that the more You read the more  You are happy...until the last page
