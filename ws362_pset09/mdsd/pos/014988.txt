I really like this book because it doesn't just list &quot;Elizabeth&quot; and the name's meaning. It also includes something of the history of the name, who has used it and when and then the author includes an exhaustive list of pet names such as Elise, Elisabeth, Lillibet, Betty, Bettina, etc. Good names and good bits of information to go with them. I still want more names though, but I'm difficult
