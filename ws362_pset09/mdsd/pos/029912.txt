Like all of the other reviewers here, I absolutely loved this book.  It is a must read that grabs your attention from the very beginning and holds on tight to it until you finish.  Which won't take you too long as you will find yourself unable to put this book down.  The only drawback that I see is in waiting for the next book in the series.  I truly recommend buying both books together so you don't have any down time in between.  Kudos to Vali for her vibrant writing
