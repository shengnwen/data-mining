This book is wonderful!  As an Early Interventionist working with 0-3 year olds I was looking for a resource that was very parent friendly.  This book address many of the issues parents of toddlers face and gives practical family friendly advice on how to handle it.  I think parents and professionals can benefit from reading this book because it is fascinating to learn why toddlers do certain things.  I loved this book!!
