This book was a lifeline for me during my last pregnancy.  Although it was my 4th time expecting a baby, being over 35 does change the way you react both physically and emotionally to pregnancy.  The book is meant to be personalized to your particular pregnancy, with spaces for you to write the dates and record your emotions and physical feelings each week. The author is an over 35 mother herself and she discusses her personal history of loss and infertility just as if she were a close personal friend helping you navigate your own pregnancy.  The analogies to help you picture what your baby looks like are especially innovative (she uses food items as examples of weight and length) and really gives you a peek into what's happening inside you when you can't actually see it yourself
