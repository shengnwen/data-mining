This book characterizes the Italian immigrant experience in coming to America as a loss of values in trade for a new life. It describes exactly how one loses the old culture, and the old ways, and thus is assimilated and often destroyed, but how endurance gives one the right to live this new life. I found it an exceptionally vivid description of two generations of life in the New York slums as an Italian immigrant family, and while it was heavy on the drama (deaths, violence, failure) its dominant trait is its complex view of the primary characters. They are both not heroic, and yet stalwarts, and impotent, and yet keeping what they can of a value system alive in a country that tears it apart at every turn with money. I like this book the best of all of Puzo's that I have read, and would recommend it to anyone as simultaneously more literary and more real than his celebrated offer-you-can't-refuse bestsellers
