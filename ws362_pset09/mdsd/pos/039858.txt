This book defines a connection game and proceeds to analyze them.  About half the book is a catalog of all the connection games that have been invented, most in the past 20 years.  I had no idea there were so many.  This book will give you a taste of all these games and how they are "connected".  It also presents ways of analyzing connection games, and has some tips on playing.  Still, this is not a book that will tell you how to win at Hex, I think the author has another book for this.

My book came with a short note on a separate piece of paper noting this error.  I found it frustrating looking things up in the indexes, although you soon become pretty good at converting.  For a fairly expensive book, this is rather sloppy publishing, and should have been caught
