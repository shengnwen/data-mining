This book was very good, but I didn't write a review to praise this book, only to coreect &quot;Tiara&quot;'s misconception.  Gwynne doesn't end up with Donovan because of alcohol.  Do you know why she had to tell herself, &quot;I can do this, I can do this . . .&quot; She is a lesbian who is in love with her best friend, and she feels betrayed when Darcy hooks up with a guy. Gwynne obviously isn't ready to tell Darcy how she feels, so when Darcy hooks up with Donovan's best friend--Gwynne decides to play it straight, so to speak.  I missed this the first time I read it, along with other themes in some of the other stories
