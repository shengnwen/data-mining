Wow! What a fantastic book if you want to learn about how Schuerholz runs the Braves. He does discuss the tough choice of leaving Kansas City to join the Braves when they weren't popular choice amongst baseball, but he couldn't have made a better choice. Some interesting views on steroids, certain ball players and the daily responsibilities of running the powerhouse Braves. So much better than Moneyball- a great read
