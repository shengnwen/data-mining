Talese's history of the sexual revolution in America reads like a Jackie Collins novel or plays like a Robert Altman movie where all of a sudden, the characters stories have crossed paths and their lives after were  irrevocably changed. You will read the page turning account of how Hugh  Hefner came to create Playboy Magazine--a story which indeed has been often  told, but not like this--interspersed with various obscenity cases of Screw  Magazine publisher/editor Goldstein, the coming of the age of Larry Flynt  and Bob Guccione, and the story of our gal Betty...Talese outdid E!  entertainment by two decades. It is a great rendering from one of our most  talented writers
