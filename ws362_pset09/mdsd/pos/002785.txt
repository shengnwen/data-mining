Jean Houston is a gifted writer and speaker. In this book, Jean reminds us that our myths have power within them. They reveal our soul and ways we manifest ourselves into daily living. In so doing, our divine and human  qualities merge into a sacred human path. -- Samuel Oliver, author of, WHAT  THE DYING TEACH US: LESSON ON LIVING
