This is a book that is 2/3 about philosophy and 1/3 about The Simpsons.  The fact that the book goes to great lengths to informing the reader about philosophy is one of the benefits about the book.  If this book did not inform the reader, many readers would not understand the philosophical references when applied to The Simpsons show.  

Not all of the essays are of equal value.  Some are not worth reading (although, thankfully, the editors were wise to add these essays to the end, where they belonged.  Thank you, editors).  

I always knew that there was a lot of depth to The Simspons.  Each of us had our own reason for believing that there is something that is impressive and fascinating about the show.  However, this book provides the philosophical context from which we can enjoy the show.  The Simsons teaches us a lot about ethics, morality, politics, American civilization, and history.  To gain a deeper bond with this show, I would highly recommend reading this intellectually stimulating book
