This study showed a new liberalism that developed at the begining of the American Republic.Ms.Applby shows how the Jeffersonian Republicans rejected the old&quot;country party&quot; ideology of their English ancestors and  developed a more libertarian and socially liberal view of society.She shows  how the Republicans rejected the old ideas of order,deference,and class  that shaped colonial society.She also points out how the Jeffesonians  rejection of mercantilism began an &quot;american&quot; ideal of free  trade,low taxes and sufferage for the common man.The study points out how  the Jeffersonians combining of diverse elements:merchants,tradesmen,and  wealthy plantation owners were bound not by an egalitarian ideal of  equality,by by an ideal of equality of opportunity within the new american  nation.Overall an excellent study
