DROWN by Junot Diaz spoke to me like no other work of fiction that I've read in many years.  It was the first time where I saw myself in the characters and felt that I knew them intimately.  They were like my own family, brothers, cousins, mother and father that I could almost feel that the stories were right out of my own childhood.  

Diaz's stories about Domincans in the Dominican Republic and the U.S.  The stories perfectly capture the struggle with poverty in the characters' native country as well as the United States.  But these stories are not didactic pieces but rather human stories about family, love, and loss.  With characters so real, that the reader will wonder when they will see them again
