Rethinking the Wineskin is, quite simply, one of the first places anyone should begin when examining the peculiar genius of Jesus and his earliest apprentices in orienting and growing organic, indigenous church communities.  Frank balances fresh biblical exegesis with a broad range of scholarship and church history.

OK, so why did I only give it four stars?  Well, I think it could use an edit, reincorporating some of the style of the earlier printing of this book.  Also--and this might be more my "fault" than the author's--I feel a growing need to address matters of justice and solidarity with the poor with regards to the communion of saints being Christ's hands and feet in the world.  I say supplement this with Steve Chalke's "Lost Message of Jesus" or Shane Claiborne's "The Irresistible Revolution," and you're getting pretty comprehensive.

My bottom line: read "Rethinking" for what it is, not what it isn't.  It is an excellent book for reimagining supple wineskins to contain the Holy Spirit's move in the twenty-first century.
