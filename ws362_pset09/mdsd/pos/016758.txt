I loved Terry Jones book "Who Murdered Chaucer", and really enjoyed the series for "Medieval Lives". And yes, I still watch the reruns of Monty Python. This book is fun and interesting, making it clear that our idea's of the way people lived in the past, based on Movies and Television, are incomplete and incorrect - at least in some cases. I think most individuals interested in the Medieval ages would find it interesting as well
