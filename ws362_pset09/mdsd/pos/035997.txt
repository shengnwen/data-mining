I agree with the other positive reviews on this book. I believed people could be possessed by demons even before I read this book, but even more-so now. I liked how the author explained the basic concepts of diabolical possession, obsession, and opression. I was horrified several times during the book, realizing  that I had many of the symptoms for diabolical opression, and the fact that my family has been in conflict for several years now. I am still somewhat weary to go to a priest and ask for advice because of the fact that the book pointed out: many priests don't believe in diabolical forces anymore. Very moving work and made me realize I need a stronger spiritual life
