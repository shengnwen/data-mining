As a professional disk jockey for a rock radio station, I absolutely LOVED this book. It's the Bible to some DJ's I know, myself included! Jim Ladd, the author, pretty much spews his autobiography here while telling an enchanting true tale of the rise and fall of free-form radio. If you've ever wondered why when you call a radio station, they won't play your request, this is where to find the answers...and you will be shocked to find out how things really operate in this, the age of the major corporation. He takes you thru the very beginning of rock radio in the California of the 60's and its emergence as the alternative to the scream-at-you style of the pop-music format. With quotes from his actual radio broadcasts and detailed interviews with such legends as the Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, Alice Cooper, and, especially, the elusive John Lennon, Ladd relives the era in an easy-to-read page-turner spiked with radio antidotes, including a tale I found particularly amusing in one of the first chapters, where he rewards himself for being able to pull 2 shifts in a 12 hour period of time by smoking marijuana on the fire escape only to lock himself out! I also enjoyed his tales on getting his listeners to flood the White House phone lines with complaints about an herbicide being sprayed on marijuana, his experience hosting one of the few live performances of Pink Floyd &quot;The Wall&quot;, and his revolt against corporate radio policies that eventually gets him fired. This book is an absolutely increadable read--it is a must for anyone who works or has worked in radio, and makes for good insight into this industry for the average radio listener. Pick yourself up a copy...you'll be delightfully surprised at its content
