A fascinating and great read about the work of SEALs in Afghanistan and Iraq. As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, the SEALs seemed to have their share of detractors in the war on terror. Therefore it was nice to see viewpoints from the SEALs themselves and a few of their missions. Compared to the other spec op units the SEALs' missions in Afghanistan and Iraq have not been as well published or publicized.

Due to op sec many operations, particularly those that ocurred in Iraq, will not see the light of day for a while, and that is one of the minor weaknesses of the book. However, the SEALs successful mission in finding the largest training camp/munitions dump in Afghanistan post 9/11 made for exciting reading.

Also fascinating are the mission planning and training tactics used by these elite warriors, and in these one can see the differences between SEALs and other spec ops units. You will be impressed by their stories of avoiding collateral damage and unnecessary use of force.

All in all, a great read and hopefully in the coming years more stories in all their unclassified glory will be revealed
