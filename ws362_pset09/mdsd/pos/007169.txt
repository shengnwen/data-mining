The Staircase was a great book. Elizabeth (Lizzy) Enders and her family were on their way to California. They were heading there to see if they could find some gold from the mines for some money. On the way Lizzy's mom died of the putrid fever. Bishop Lamy was paying the family to bring back his niece, Elinora, to The Sisiters of Loretta. It was in Santa Fe. Lizzy thought she was very annoying. Since Lizzy's mom died her dad knew he would have to get himself established first, which would have been really hard to do with Lizzy there. When they arrived at the church Mr. Enders left her there, without any goodbyes. It just so happens that she is forced to stay in the same room with the annoying Elinora. Lizzy was very sart mouthed, so she was breaking rules left and right. She was forced to have many chores. For one, she had to escort a woman called Mrs. Lacy to the cemetery everyday. Lizzy was happy because she got to leave the convent for a few hours. While she did these chores she made many adult friends. She made friends with all the nuns and came to learn her way around Santa Fe when she walked with Mrs. Lacy. There was one huge problem. The Bishop just had a choir loft built, but the carpenter took his money without making a staircase. The girls at the school prayed everyday to a novena to Saint Joseph expecting a miracle to come. Of course Lizzy didn't believe a miracle was going to come, so read The Staircase and see what she decides to do. Will she be able to go back home? Will she get a carpenter to finish the job without the girls being mad because their miracle didn't come true?
