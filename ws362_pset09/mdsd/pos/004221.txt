Pearl Buck describes the simple life of a village family in China before and during World War II.   She follows the lives of each family member, the daughter &amp; her husband who cooperate with the Japanese, the sons who  escape to the hills &amp; join the Chinese resistance, the youngest teenage  daughter who is sent away to avoid rape, the simple aging farmer &amp; his  wife who stay with their land at all costs.  While the village &amp; nearby  city are never named, it is evocative in some respects of the new book,  &quot;The Rape of Nanking.&quot;  I've read this book twice
