I was looking for a book that would give me some new ideas for my cocktail party.  This book came through with flying colors -- lots of unique recipes ranging from simple (spiced pecans and roasted red pepper feta dip) to difficult (homemade tarts).  This book has some great menu recommendations that suggest items based on criteria like &quot;make ahead&quot; or &quot;informal&quot; or &quot;impressive&quot;.  This book has been well worth the money spent on it
