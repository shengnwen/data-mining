The book is terrific. I think it has to be read with a bit of humility, though. In my view is the only way we can recognize our own flaws, to give it a shot at correcting them.

The book presents several psychological traits that most humans, in one way or another, present when reacting to money decisions. Some of us tend to have more of one than another, but I think we all have some of each.


The authors present simple real-life dilemmas that we all encounter at some point . We are not talking about how to pick the next hot hedge fund or whether to sell an option short. Then they ask the reader what their reaction would be to those dilemmas. Making it an almost interactive book, without getting you to exercises like "get a notebook and right the top-ten...". I do not like those exercises other books have since I tend to read in places where I cannot write, at the airport, in my bus commute, in bed.

I am a very avid reader of personal finance books, I'm also a CPA. The nice part about this book is that it was beyond the technicalities of money decisions.  And puts them in a perspective that is very helpful, and also that any human being can relate and understand, without needing a financial background.

I consider myself very unemotional when it comes to money decisions, so starting to read the book I was a bit cocky about my expectation. You know, I thought to myself "this might be a book for all those people that go buy stuff, just because is on sale, not because they need them" and things of that sort. To my surprise I found myself guilty of many of the traits that are part of being human. This I found, thought me a lot of lessons. I will not say the book has "fixed" me. But it certainly has made me more aware of my thinking process, which ultimately helps on getting a better perspective.

I'm typing this review several months after having read this book. I just stumbled over it here at Amazon, and thought that it was worth of my first ever review
