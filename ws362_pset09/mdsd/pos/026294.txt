When I reviewed this book &quot;Sweets&quot; I said to my daughter.  Ms. Pinner must be a relatie of ours.  The recipes are so familiar.  Not only are the recipes familiar but the pictures and the memories are familiar also.  I will be using this book quite often.  She even had the old fashion &quot;Nana Pudding&quot; receipe that was used before they starting using instant pudding.  You Go Girl!
