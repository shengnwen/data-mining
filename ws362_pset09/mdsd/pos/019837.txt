This book was a very impressive memoir and handbook written by the mother of an autistic child.  Having been interested in Autism, I picked up the book expecting it to be very medical and difficult to understand, but I was soon proven wrong.  The book is a quick read that makes the information plain and simple to understand.  She approaches dietary intervention and how it affected her son's progress in overcomming Autism, as well as accounts from other mothers of autistic children.  This book is excellent if you are the parent of an autistic child, or if you are just interested in the subject.  Definitely worth reading
