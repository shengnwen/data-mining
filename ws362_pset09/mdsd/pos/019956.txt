Just finnished reading this book.  I'd say it is unbias.  It is jam packed with facts and Historical refs about The Medici family and their impact on the Italian Culture, Catholocism and European Politics.  The book is a good historical overview, partly slow going but a valuable read for those wishing knowledge on the Italian Renaissance.  I doubt that the Medici were as powerful during their respective times as the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers but the Medici was most deffinately the most powerful, or one of the most powerful families in Europe, if not the World with more direct influence over Culture, Politics and Religion. Very good book.  Worth the read and a good addition to any library.
