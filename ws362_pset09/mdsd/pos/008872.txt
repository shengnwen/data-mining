I love Ms. Roberts books so much because of all the magic she brings into them...but this time,the magic is so literal--no pun intended.  

The characters were just exceptional.  I loved watching Nell blossom in very page.  From being so scared and broken to becoming a strong woman/witch and taking life into her hands.  I loved that Zack took Nell for what she was and helped her become the woman she became through-out the books.  

The characters of Mia,Ripley,and Lulu were very entertaining as well.  I read the rest of the novels and enjoyed them as much but Nell and Zack's story will always be the most special to me.
