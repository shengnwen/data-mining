This book had such great informiation!!  A lot of information on breastfeeding while pregnant (I wish I had thought to buy it then!)  Nonetheless, it had a wealth of information on nursing two, including a many position suggestions.  A great book for Mom who wants to keep nursing the "baby" when the new one arrives
