This book is quite amazing. Many books provide a great deal of information on a particular subject without putting it in an understandable format. This book is extremly easy to read and will give you a good understanding of how steam heat operates. On top of that, the book is written in an entertaining fashion. I am currently upgrading the steam boiler on my house and feel this book gave me the knowledge I need make decisions regarding the upgrade
