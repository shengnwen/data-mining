This is the first of the M. Reilly books I've read and the best.  The books are definitely ones that do not require you to think.  If this book were a movie, the special effects would be non-stop and amazing. The hero, who is a college professor in ancient languages, turns out to be an incredible athlete.  Right.

I recommend this book if you want to just escape and not to think
