  Not in the "must read " class, but a good informative personal account of Thomas Freidman, the New York Times middle east journalist.  The book contains his observances of the factional fighting that took place in Beirut and the larger Lebanon, Israel conflict in the 1980s.  The  book has interesting observances of these complicated situations.  This is a good book for the 21st century where it appears Lebanon   is again descending into chaos, and Israel has once again tried the tactic of invading southern Lebanon.  Freidman does a good job making a chaotic situation interesting while providing new insights
