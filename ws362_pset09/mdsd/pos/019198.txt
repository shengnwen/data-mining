Desmond Morris has created an extremely provocative and challenging book that forces one to question "humanity's" everyday and all-time reactions and motivations. It challenges one to analyse and understand whether we are as intelligent as we think.  This book is as valid today as it was when it was written 40 years ago.  Our arrogance in seeing ourselves as being intelligent beings is exposed or at least called into question.  The Naked Ape, used well, forces one to continually re-assess and measure society's and one's own behaviour
