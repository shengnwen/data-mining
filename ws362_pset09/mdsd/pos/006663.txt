This is a beautiful book, an important factor to consider when attempting to interest a child in working with numbers in general  and solving equations in particular.  The illustrations are eye-catching, the colours are bright, the paper is thick and glossy, and the book is a nice size for parent and child to read together at bedtime.  My child has no interest in math, and I found that appealling to her more imaginative side as this book does sparked her curiosity.  The method the  author has used to pique children's interest in solving basic mathematical problems is creative and engaging.
The reason I have given this book 4 stars rather than 5 is that after going through the book twice or three times and, more importantly, solving the problems, the book no longer held my child's interest.  It has been sitting on the shelf untouched for months
