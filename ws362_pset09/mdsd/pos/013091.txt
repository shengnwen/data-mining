This is an awesome book containing so much pertinent and vital information on preventing and treating heart disease.  Dr. Sinatra presents information in an easy to read fashion...explaining technical medical terms and functions to the lay person in a way we can understand. I also appreciated his use of graphs, tables and charts.  

This is the first book I have ever read of Dr. Sinatra's. Prior to reading this book, I had only read his monthly newsletters.  In the book, I thoroughly enjoyed all of his examples from his practice along with his personal history and journey that has led him to this point in his career.  His exceptional care and heartfelt concern for people are rarely witnessed in this often sterile, cold age of increased technology and information. 

It is very obvious from reading "The Sinatra Solution", that Dr. Sinatra has a passion for health and longevity and compassion for people.  He's a REAL doctor.  He is always learning, always reading, always asking questions and seeking...never giving up! 

I highly recommend this book for anyone with heart challenges or a family history of heart challenges.
