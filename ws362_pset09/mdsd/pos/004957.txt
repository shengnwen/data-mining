I'm enjoying this book a lot.  I wouldn't say I was interested in the concepts in The DaVinci Code until I read it.  Once I read it I became interested in the facts behind Dan Browns fiction.

Previously I read a couple of books that positioned themselves very much against Dan Browns interpretations of history and while the viewpoints were interesting, I felt they were a bit combative.

Enter "Secrets of the Code" by Dan Burstein.  This book really digs in depth on many of the mysteries in the DaVinci Code.  Most importantly it presents well balanced discussion from both sides.  It doesn't sway one way or the other and just provides information from experts on the topics being discussed and how those concepts relate to the DaVinci Code and history in general.

If you are going to read a book before the movie, make it this one.  You won't be disappointed
