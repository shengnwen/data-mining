If you're just about to start reading to your baby, you might want to get this book because it has all the core ingredients to captivate a baby's attention. It's pretty short (10 pages), has very simple text with huge and colorful illustrations. But, if you have long started reading to your child, this book might be a bit of a frustration. It's just too simple. Once you have engaged your child into the daily reading activity for quite sometime, you can actually hold her attention for a good 5-10 minutes. To me, make full use of that time by reading books that have a bit more text than this one
