As indicated by the title, this is a collection of angelic messages, one for each day of the year. The idea is that of having an inspiring message to read each day, so as to stay on track and spiritually on target, by starting the day with a positive and inspired outlook. However it can also be used as an oracle. Think of a question or issue that may be on your mind and then open the book at random and read the message which appears. I have found it very useful in this way, as the messages seem to almost always be on target. As usual when working with Doreen's material, the energy of the angels is palpable, whch is what makes her books and products so worthwhile, as it allows so many people to easily connect with this very pure angelic vibration. A good book to consult whenever in need of an extra boost of faith and trust in the divine order in all things
