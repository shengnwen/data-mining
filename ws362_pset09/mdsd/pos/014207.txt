I learned a lot from this book and enjoyed the tone of it (although "Idiots' guide to..." would have been too much for me.  I can recommend this book to somebody who is just starting out.  I think this is perfect for somebody who is working out with a multi-gym machine or with no machines at home.  Actually the parts I enjoyed most were not the Exercise sections.  I chose "Teach Yourself Visually Weight Training" over this initially because that one shows and explains exercises precisely for more machines that are in my gym.  I found it helpful to know common mistakes and appreciate resources on books, videos and Internet sites.  I generally like Dummies series and I intend to buy "Fit over 40" one next
