While this biography is very self serving it is a good look at an interesting company. With the rise of Krispy Kreme and starbucks it is easy to forget about the largest donut chain in the country.  Rosenberg talks about his days and his focus as a coffee shop.  To Dunkin donuts the donuts are simply a side business. This mentality is fascinating and for small business trying to decide on a mission this would be well worth reading.  The book is fairly well written and it is hard to find books on this subject so if you are interested it is worth reading.
