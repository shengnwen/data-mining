Well I ran into another Ace classic pulp edition of LO! and found it not only worth a third read (that in itself says it all) but a book profoundly liberating.

LO! takes on Einstein by detailing peer-reviewed, academic, empirical studies which contradicted Einstein's theory.  Back when Fort wrote LO! such "walking the plank" manuevers by any writer would be considered unfortunate at best.  Today though, with the upsurge of Modified Newtonian Dyanamics (MOND) to account for the missing 96% of the universe (of whatever) Charles Fort has finally come into his own.

The man was a genius because he runs the gamut of possible explanations for his "damned facts" but does so in a writing style that competes with Beckett or Joyce.

Those damned teleporting whirlwinds! With quantum electronics repeatedly verifying faster-than-light signals (not just "after the fact" randomized superliminal information that was correlated) Fort's teleporting whirlwinds are now in the lab!

If anything, for those who find Fort's conjectures hard to digest, he at least recreates the grand wonder of discovery, showing how essentially humans are puny little nodes in a vast network of self-organizing complexity.  But then that's what the top science research states as well, although most of the "real" scientists are psychologically not able to handle the new power laws of network theory.

That's why LO! should be required reading for all "serious" scientists.  

Why limit ourselves
