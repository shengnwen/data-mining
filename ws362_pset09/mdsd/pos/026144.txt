First off, I must confess that I'm not a Jew. I can't speak Yiddish and the four semesters of German 101 that I took didn't help me much here. However, I have since added a lot of Yiddish to my vocabulary -- and that causes a lot of confusion when delivered with my native Texan drawl.
I'm not sure what first attracted me to this book -- the New York Times review or the cover picture of the cranky kid, but this is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in the past 10 years. Wex's humor is incredible and insightful, and he draws upon American pop culture references that even a Goy like myself can get, mixing them up with Jewish culture and history into a big, tasty Kosher gumbo (I realize that gumbo probably isn't Kosher, but I enjoy mixing metaphors here). I think I learned more about what it means to be a Jew from Wex than I ever did from Elie Wiesel, Isaac Bashevis Singer or Barbra Streisand. His jokes are certainly funnier
