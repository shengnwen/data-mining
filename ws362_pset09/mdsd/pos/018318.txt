 This is my first Julian Barnes novel as well.

 As a Sherlock Holmes fan the premise was interesting but somehow I found only the plight of George and his family to be the most interesting. With Doyle I think I was given almost too much information-just enough to wonder if I really liked the author as a man.

  I read the book in under two days on a trip and despite the misgivings I had when I started it, it did turn out to be a worthwhile read-an interesting look at the times and the foibles of the English legal system at that time
