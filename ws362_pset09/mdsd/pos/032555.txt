While I agree with the reviewer that the rhyme is not quite as smooth as Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, pre-reading a couple times to smooth that out takes the flaw out completely, leaving a wonderful read aloud. I teach younger children math, and they would listen to this as many times as I can read it, with great enjoyment.
