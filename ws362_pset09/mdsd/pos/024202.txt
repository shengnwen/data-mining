Deadman's Bluff closes the story begun in Deadman's Poker about the World Poker Showdown at least insofar as how the tournament turns out and how the fates of many...but not all...of the characters created therein are decided. You really do need to read the first book before wading into this one.

Gloria Curtis seems destined to appear for at least a while in any future book as she and Tony Valentine have personal issues to work out which will probably be very entertaining. One hopes that Rufus Steele will show up again if for no other reason than to show those of us who have had a sheltered upbringing how an aging gambler that smokes like a stove can beat a Kentucky Derby type race horse in a one hundred yard dash; how one can hyponotize a fly to land on one of many sugar cubes, etc., etc., with the result always being that Rufus announces..."I win."

Gerry Valentine's reformation from being a bookie who constantly disappointed his father to a valued partner in the enterprise, Grift Sense will continue. Mabel will continue to answer the phones and keep Tony's life in some kind of order and the scammers and grifters out there will continue to supply business for Tony to solve and James Swain to tell us about.

All of Swain's books are funny, well written, educational and above all, highly entertaining. You will enjoy the experience
