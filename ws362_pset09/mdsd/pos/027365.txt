If this work were fiction it would be an exceptional read, unfortunately, it is just HORRIFYING!!! 

Casey is the ominous voice & Bush is the corrupt clown behind the curtain strategizing & manipulating his way to the White House.

Liberals will love it, Conversatives will repel its Republican blasphemy, and everyone else will appreciate the sliver of light exposing this political cancer.

Gary Sick writes a fabulous tale of factual American political corruption, deceipt & manipuation...painfully it carries the burden of being a history book...and for its contents, I am ashamed
