Chinaski's in a cycle like the ancient symbol of the serpent giving itself a head job. Does he write to get girls, or does he get girls to write about them? 

His compulsions to write and to screw around are connected: both are about immortality. He wants to live till 80 then have sex an 18 year old as a way to "cheat death", and the women who go after him see their ticket to immortality. 

Another reason they go after him is he advertises in his books his support of the fantasy that men have control. It's exposed as fantasy by the fact that women get in contact with him knowing what they're getting into. 

Although he often describes his sex like rape, it's clear that he likes thinking that way in part because he knows women do the choosing. When he is rejected (which he documents occasionally) he is powerless. And when he meets his 18-year-old-looking girl and expects it to feel like a "child rape", it turns out to feel like the child's raping him. 

It proves the writer's skill that although I read this at a time when I crave more experience with sexy young girls, I sometimes felt more pity than envy for the characters in this book. The hot women get their immortality, but they don't get to choose which parts are immortalized.

There's a contradiction in Chinaski going on about immortality and then calmly explaining that the booze makes him sick, that the odds are against him each time he goes to the track, and that the neighborhood he can afford after the booze and gambling is dangerous. 

But like the snake that swallows itself, it seems impossible to finish the job of self-destruction. In the end Chinaski reveals that he sees himself as a "good guy". Maybe he felt the best shot at living forever was to be his own worst enemy because at least that's an enemy guaranteed to ultimately show mercy
