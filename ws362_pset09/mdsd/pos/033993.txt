This book not only comes with almost 300 stories, but a introduction that covers the Grimm brothers lives and their gathering of the stories. In the end it also has a very thick glossary that covers the credits of each story, most even say who the exact source the story came from. It's a literary masterpiece full of the Grimm's collected folklore and almost thirty new stories that I myself have searched for everywhere and couldn't find exept in this copy. Don't let the different names of a few of the stories through you though, every story had origanaly abuot five names and are referred to by anyone in different editions and company's prints. This is truely a grand buy for anyone who just wants to have a book with some illustrations and tons of stories for thier kids, or wants to reseach them. If this is for kids, I'm sure you know to be careful, some of the stories are very gruesome
