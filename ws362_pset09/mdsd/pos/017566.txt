Although this book is not nearly as Popular as Kite Runner, it gives a more accurate representation of life under the Taliban.  In Kite Runner this was almost a passing fancy.  Here everyday life is more accurately portrayed in the lives of simple people enmeshed in the realities of Talibanian existence both from in insider's and outsider's perspective.  Although not nearly the comfortable read as Kite Runner, if the reader wants a flavor of living under the Taliban, this is the place to read.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is I believe the book could have given a more complete vignette then it did
