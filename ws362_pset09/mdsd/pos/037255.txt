If you read this book , and understand the implications ,of what it means, then all our preconceptions ,of prehistoric people are  destroyed . As Piccasso said ,after visiting prehistoric cave paintings ,We have invented nothing . Have a look at the hair styles ,and sensuous clothing on the figurines ,look at the  sensuous art work ,see that there are no weapons of war , come away troubled. Rob Whitesid
