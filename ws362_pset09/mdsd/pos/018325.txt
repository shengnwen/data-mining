As with other Nabokov novels, 'The Defence' is primarily about Nabokov himself; certainly not in terms of biographical detail, but as a vehicle for his own obsessive translation of the world into prose.  His literary skill is quite overwhelming, in both a positive and negative sense, and one wonders whether he, the medium of this skill, was as thrilled and burdened by it as his 'creature' Luzhin was by a comparable skill in chess.

While in some books the characters are memorable, or a turn in the plot is key, or an entire fictional world is born, here the book itself, as an object, as a construction of words, dominates proceedings.  Words swarm over every detail recounted in the book, at once transforming the mundane into something precious and, at times, obscuring the distinction bewteen what is important and what trivial - the same skill is devoted to describing a bearskin as to describing a marriage; it is probably no accident that John Updike provides an afterword to some editions, since his work is blessed with the same heavy burden.

The character of Luzhin is largely viewed from the exterior.  His interior world, when approached, is still seen from one remove - we do not so much share Luzhin's mind's eye as peer over his shoulder.  What we do know of his interior is minimal, not through lack of access but in virtue of lack of content - he is largely bereft of normal human emotion.  His fear of the world is very much an amorphous angst.  His aspirations are free-standing and without worldly motivation.  He is, in many ways, not a character at all.  The same could be said of the girl whom he courts, and who, in a virtuouso display, remains anonymous for the entire novel, starting off as a semi-circular black silk handbag (with a faulty Freudian clasp), developing into a personal pronoun, then a fiancee and so on.  These may as well be pieces upon a chessboard.

And indeed they are.  In his foreword, Nabokov is excited by the structure of the novel, in particular its relation to a chess game.  While for mine the analogy is strained, he at least declares the lie of the novel's appeal.

Finally, if you approach the novel through the hope of finding an actual discussion of the game of chess, you will leave disappointed save for imagistic accounts and metaphors, often musical, with few or no moves given.  There is a film version but, sadly, the director makes the unfortunate mistake of thinking this to be a work of social realism, and the result is cinematic effluent.
*
Treated less as a novel and more as a testament of Nabokov's linguistic prowess, 'The Defence' succeeds, and affords pleasure in a way analagous to that afforded by a spectacular game by Kasparov, or Tal, or Alekhine, or any of a number of other Russians.
