This the ninth book in the Left Behind series kept me turning pages. This book is actually filled with adventure. Though the characters are still two dimensional, the writing very simple, and the text font large. It was a page-turner and the best book of this series so far.

In this book we see the Antichrist desecrate the Holy Temple of Israel. And the Mark of the beast being officially placed on worshipers. And the first two bowls of wrath are poured upon the world. The changing of water to blood again and the worshipers of the beast who have the mark inflicted with sores and boils.

The Tribulation Force uses the Co-op to get all the pilots they can into Israel in order to help with the mass Exodus of the Jews out of Jerusalem. And the Chosen People of God who have accepted Christ come under his divine protection. And we see this protection as the forces try to stop these evacuees from reaching Petra. And once again when the Global Community Military tries to assault Petra. The book ends with a devastating attack on Petra that the results are left as a cliffhanger.
