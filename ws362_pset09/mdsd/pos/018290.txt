Financial aspects of film/video projects are not always fun, but are vitally essential. In this book, Simon and Wiese give an overview of what goes into starting a production company and the basics of pre-production planning and budgeting. Next, they cover a detailed "line item" list of possible expenses you could encounter. Finally, the second half of the book goes through sample budgets for various projects ($5 million feature film, music video, documentary, student film, etc). 
Although the book is long, you don't have to read the entire thing (you just choose which budget best fits your needs, and adjust it accordingly). Also, because it is organized so well, it is much less intimidating. Thus, the authors have taken a potentially boring, complicated topic and made it much more engaging and understandable.
As I said, this is not a pretty topic to deal with, but it is one that is necessary and vital to filmmaking. The only people I would recommend getting this book are those that find themselves in the role of Producer. (And for them, I strongly recommend getting this!) I produced a $6,000 movie with no model budget and that was difficult enough; the more money you're responsible for, the more guidance you need to achieve your budget. And while some may think this book is a bit more money than they want to spend. All I will say this: the cost of purchasing this book is far less than the cost of going over-budget or screwing something up due to poor financial planning ahead of time.
