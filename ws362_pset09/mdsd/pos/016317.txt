I would consider myself a beginner, trying a few more complicated patterns as I gain experience. The patterns in this book are beautiful, well presented, but it will be quite a while before I try one. They are not for the "average beginning knitter". If I'd taken the time to look at this book in another store before ordering it from Amazon, I probably would have waited to purchase it. However, I'm glad I do have it....gives me a goal to work towards. I gave 4 stars because I do think it's a wonderfully done book for the right audience
