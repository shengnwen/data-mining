I thank the families mentioned in this book. Each one tried to help their autistic child and wanted an answer to what caused Autism.  Some of them started SafeMinds as a result of their research and inquiries.  I was born in 1977 and have an ASD so the possible thimerosal in vaccinations causing the Autism epidemic in the 1990s would not explain me. Thimerosal (p. 48) is 49.6 percent organic mercury used as a preservative in vaccinations.  Organic mercury (p. 48) is the second most toxic substance on earth. Forget about "polluting" our air and water, and ask why are we putting toxic materials into children?  People are more important than the earth! For some reason The Center for Disease and Control and The Institute of Medicine along with Lilly (a vaccine manufacturer) have not cooperated with them in answering their questions or giving them help. Why would Dr. Thomas Verstraeten go to Belgium in 2001 after leading a study on vaccination datalink study on thimerosal, be told not to answer any contacts from people in America about vaccinations, and to escape subpeonas (p. 341)? I appreciate Congressmen Dan Burton (R-IN) and Dave Weldon (R-FL) for listening to these families, holding hearings (I have called their offices to thank them), and talking the CDC and IOM into getting the public answers to autism and thimerosal.
