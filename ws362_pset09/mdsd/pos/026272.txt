This would be a valuable text for anyone working with the Jungian model of alchemy, but I'll echo the view that it is not exactly a beginner's book. If you're new to this kind of work, a good place to start would be Calvin Hall's Primer of Jungian Psychology. 

Excellent companions to Anatomy would be Jung on Active Imagination, edited by Chodorow, and Jung's own Memories, Dreams and Reflections, or Man and His Symbols.

Edinger's book would also be a smart buy for anyone practicing pathworking or other spiritual techniques that make extensive use of imagination. If this is your thing, another great companion text would be Alchemy & Mysticism: the Hermetic Museum, by Roob. That book is a peerless collection of alchemical images. Occult Psychology (one of my personal favorites), by Alta J. LaDage, would also be a very natural fit
