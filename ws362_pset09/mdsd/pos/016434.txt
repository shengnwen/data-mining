Holly W. Whitcomb's Seven Spiritual Gifts of Waiting is truly a gift unto itself. Whether you're simply waiting for the bus, or waiting for the diagnosis of a loved one, this book offers hope and inspiration to those looking for meaning in the hardships of life. 

Whitcomb explores patience, loss of control, living in the present, compassion, gratitude, humility, and trust in God as spiritual offerings that we so commonly overlook in our daily lives. 

Her suggestions for reframing life's uncontrollable circumstances promise to be life-changing, and her book, full of personal anecdotes, poems, Biblical selections, and excerpts from inspirational writings, is delightful and captivating--something to be read again and again.

Holly W. Whitcomb has been a pastor and clergy-woman since 1978. She is the Director of Kettlewood Retreats in Wisconsin, and travels nationally to lead retreats and spiritual events. Whitcomb is the author of three previous books, including Feasting with God and Practicing Your Path. 

Armchair Interviews says: Be sure to pick up extra copies--this is a gift you will want to share.
