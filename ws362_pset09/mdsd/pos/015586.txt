Kevin Burk has truly written a great comprehensive view of some classical interpretations of astrology.  With a strong surge to return to basic and classical astrology, the timing for this book is hitting a great market. Burke goes into wonderful detail over aspect patterns, which most books do not fully articulate.  His clear description over the difference between some modern interpretations and classical is very helpful.  I didn't think I could possibly use or need another astrology book.  I've been doing it for quite a long while, but I was intrigued and picked it up.  I am so glad I did.  It truly is one of the better books on astrology.  Not so much for the beginner
