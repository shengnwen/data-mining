I bought this book based on the comments in Amazon.com from professional podcasters, and I found it to be helpful. As a first-time podcaster, I was looking for an easy-to-understand manual. This book got pretty technical and frankly, I skipped several chapters in my search for a tutorial to get me going ASAP. I found the writing to be geared for PC users, not so much Mac users, and since I own Mac computers, I was aware of the slight bias. But the author did a good job of providing a thorough overview of podcasting and blogging. And he did suggest a particular software for creating, validating, and publishing podcasts using Mac OSX. I downloaded the trial version of it. The process was rather challenging, but customer support was excellent. I published my first podcast, got it into iTunes, and purchased the product
