This play has imaginatively captured a lifetime of struggles one woman experiences, depicted as three women as the same woman in different ages in her life. Albee uses believable situations that are all easily relatable,  emphasizing how we deal with our problems and how we deal with ourselves. I  would recommend this play for theatergoers, novel readers and especially  students of the theater. &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; should sit on the  shelf next to &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; and &quot;Les Liaisons  Dangereuses&quot;. Happy reading
