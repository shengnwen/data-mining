This book has a very detailed description of the deathcare industry as it relates to African-Americans. Once you get past the emotional prologue that recounts the death of the author's son, you get a very engaging story of the funeral industry, the history of black deaths in the US, and the importance of community during times of bereavement. On the lighter side, there is discussion of "the show" associated with African-American funerals. The truth and insights in this discussion allowed me to relive my experience of going to rural southern funerals. It particularly reminded me of playing TAPS, hidden behind moss-covered oaks during funerals for veterans. The sermon in the final chapter is pure poetry--the kind I would want at my "final performance." Passed On should be read by anyone who has ever wondered about any aspect of the death industry or who has an interest in American history
