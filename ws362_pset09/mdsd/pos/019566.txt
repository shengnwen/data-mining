Lawrence Krauss has a particular knack for taking the reader through a wonderful journey of discovery through science, and Hiding in the Mirror does just that.  His scholarly approach is both witty and colloquial, profoundly informative without being preachy.  The book begins with a lively introduction to modern-day cosmology, relativity and quantum physics, the quest for the grand unifying theory and a presentation and critique of a potential candidate: string theory.  His critique is timely and well presented, and never without the humor and readability which marks Lawrence Krauss as one of the greatest science writers today.  This is Krauss' best work, and an absolute joy to read
