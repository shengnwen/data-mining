Apart from the Bible, no other book has inspired me so much, and led me to a greater and deeper understanding of the awesomeness of our Creator!  Dr. Paul Brand and Philip Yancey have beautifully and miraculously opened the  eyes of the layman to see the wonder of the creation through our own  bodies, and the relationship of the natural with the spiritual!!!  I cannot  recommend this book highly enough.  I am using it to build a study of  biology for school.      Sit down with this book, and let Paul and Philip  lift up your eyes and your spirit to see God in a way you probably never  have before.  Truly inspiring and revelational!@!
