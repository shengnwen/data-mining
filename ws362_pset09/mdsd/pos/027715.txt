I borrowed this book from my local library. We have cooked 5 different dishes from the book, all of which were delicious. The recipes are well-written, very detailed cooking instructions are given, specifying the kind of vegetables used (e.g. Finn potatoe, Muir Organic Tomatoes...), the cooking times (in minutes) for each step, the ammount of vegetables used.

The recipes all ternd out to be very tasty and wonderful, even for a non-vegetarian like me. However, sometimes, I found the ammounts of different ingredients too much, a bit more simplicity  in the recipes would have focused the taste and saved money, when some expensive ingredients just "dissappeared" in the pot. 

As a note of caution, one should be aware that few of these recipes are quick recipes, most require an hour or more of preparation time (making stocks, sauces, chopping vegatables, mixing and grinding spices). However, I loved the approach of "making things from scratch" - things can always be replaced, and in certain cases suggestions are made
