This delightful rhyming story takes the reader on the adventure of Edward the Emu, who decides being an Emu is boring, and travels around the zoo, trying to be other animals, only to discover that perhaps being an Emu is the best thing there is. With its fantastic illustrations, and rollicking rhymes, this would make a great bedtime story (and it isn't too long for parents who start dropping off to sleep when pressed into reading for ages each night)
