For my research on Chinese painters and painting techniques I am in China. Taking a copy of this book with me as a reference work, now I end up buying it again for some of my Chinese friends. They are all very interested in this still very accurate and usefull book for restorers and other people working with Art. The coverage of materials is very complete
