This is a great book if you want to know why the Middle East is the way it is.  Jeffrey Goldberg is a great writer.  He's funny, but he also explains everything about both Arabs and Jews in a serious way.  He knows so much about Israel, the Palestinians and the Bible, and he talks about all of that in this book.  I also thought it was a great adventure story!  Amazing how much he has seen and been through.  A definite must-read
