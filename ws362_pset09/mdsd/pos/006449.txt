Attached to this story since I first read it in high school, I consider this book the most romantic story ever written, of a man who falls in love with the past, a fantasy and its ever-after legacy!  It is easy and quick  to read for younger minds.  It will beat any other fiction  &quot;short&quot; story for its philosophical pondering about our temporal  existence and the legacy of an invention.  Definitely, &quot;La Invension  de Morel&quot; is another jewel of Hispanic American writing yet to be  discovered by the masses
