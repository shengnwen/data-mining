First off, the author is DICK QUINN and the book is a fabulous recounting of what happened to Dick Quinn after a heart attack and subsequent coronary artery bypass surgery. When a "full body scan" in 2002 showed I had badly occluded coronary arteries, I by luck, found a friend who had Dick's book.

I have followed Dick Quinn's regimen as closely as possible and now am approaching age 64. I truly feel that what Dick Quinn has written in this book and a subsequent book, "Death by Deception" should be read by all who have been advised by their doctors that they need surgery, etc to cure a coronary problem, et al.

This book is a true "eye opener"

I hope that this brief review has been of help
