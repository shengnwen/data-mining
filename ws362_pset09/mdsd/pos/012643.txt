This textbook by Weston et al. provides an excellent overview of the various forms of M&amp;A. However, having bought the previous edition, I was a bit disppointed with the extent of the revisions. For instance: in  the chapter International M&amp;A, which have undergone dramatic changes in  the 8 years between the two editions, hardly any alterations have been  made. This criticism also applies to a few other chapters.  In summary  though, had this book been updated in more detail, I would have given it  five stars without hesitation!
