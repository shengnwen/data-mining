Vicker and Hein's book, &quot;The Fast Forward MBA in Business Communication&quot; is a must have for business people in all levels of experience. &quot;The Fast Forward&quot; doesn't miss a step in modern business communication from basic memo writing to more advanced writing such as proposals and requests for proposals. This book is written in easy to understand language with charts, graphs, and plenty of sample documents that makes it extremely user friendly. It has a back to the basics approach that reminds even a frequent business document writer of some all-too-often overlooked ideas and concepts surrounding business communication.      Especially useful is Vicker and Hein's revised four-step writing and editing process. Their addition creates a much needed six-step process that allows writers more thought and time during the crucial editing step.      &quot;Fast Forward&quot; should find its place in business offices as a handbook and quick reference for business documents and other resources. It is also suitable for the college classroom. I used &quot;Fast Forward&quot; in a business communication course and it served as an excellent resource for my students. Vicker and Hein make tough ideas easy through excellent writing, lay-out and design. It is clear that they employed their six-step writing and editing process
