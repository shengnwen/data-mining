Before getting this title I had downloaded a couple of scheduling software to start planning a short film but soon discovered that I had no clue how to get started and transform the written words in the script to a detailed plan of action for the cast and crew to follow.  

Although this book is a little old - the second edition was published in 1991- the principals for film scheduling it contains are invaluable for anyone involved in planning a film or video production.  It guides you through the logical process of transforming any script into the foundation for a precise film schedule.  Brief and concise explanations about color-coding your script, transferring these tags to breakdown sheets and then working with the strip board to fine tune your schedule.  It uses Francis Ford Coppola's Conversation as a sample script, and it takes up a large chunk of the book.  This helps illustrate a very complex film and what was the mindset for breaking it down into shooting days in the most adverse conditions, but you can always use your own. It also includes a chapter on computer scheduling but most of the software presented are outdated; the most important thing you can learn from this chapter is that you need to understand the fundamentals, key parameters and how the process is done manually before sitting in front of a computer and this book does just that.

I must also point out that you can breeze through the pages as I was able to finish this book in just two days (over the weekend) leaving me enough time to practice the basics and go to the computer to prepare a reasonable film schedule
