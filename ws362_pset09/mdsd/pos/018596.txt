I read this book during my second pregnancy.  Now pregnant again, I knew I needed a refresher.   I realize that many books and magazines provide pregnancy and postpartum information, but author (and mother) Theresa Francis-Cheung includes quotes from interviews with moms that really tell it like it is - from their worries about weight gain to battling postbaby blues.  The most helpful tip for me is a list of "Nutrient-Rich Foods" (Chap 22) designed to help you lose weight postpartum.  I made a copy of it and posted it on my fridge.  I recommend it to all moms, whether this is your first child or not
