I was interested in this book from the title. I read through pretty quickly and I admit that some of the near death experiences were far fetched, but overall I enjoyed this book. It needs some tweeking to be up on the same level as other thrillers. The author takes an interesting idea (restoration of a Tsar in Russia) and makes a story of surviving Romanovs seem new. Not a great read, but one I still recommend
