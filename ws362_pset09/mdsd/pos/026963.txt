As background, I have worked with Tojo Thatchenkery on teaching Appreciative Inquiry here in India. 

Having always been fond of the subject, I continued to be diappointed that the field had relatively little concrete theoretical foundations. With this book, the authors have helped to create the requisite conceptual backing for the field of AI.

The book is well researched and structured, thus making it very interesting to read. I would recommend it to everybody who is passionate about harnessing human potential to the benefit of humanity
