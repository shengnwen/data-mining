Kirk Johnson is a gutsy person and this is a great account of his running adventures. You can feel the doubt, anticipation, pain and triumph in every word. It's almost like being next to Kirk each step of the way. And what an adventure of self-discovery it is! A very well written and highly enjoyable book
