I'm into self improvement and thought it'd be interesting to hear the perspective of an athlete on how one can perform better. I thought listening to this (unabridged) audio CD would be a productive way to spend my commute to work. And I was right.

This book demonstrates which principles one should employ to achieve goals, be a team player, and a leader -- all while maintaining good spirit. Every principle was backed by examples of real and successful people -- so there is no B.S. and I like that. It includes stories of legendaries such as John Wooden, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, etc. It even includes business world examples from Tom Mitchell's (the co-author) corporate coaching experiences and Joe's business experiences. It's definitely not about Joe. 

I am not a football fan, and was definitely not expecting their talk to be so real. Their advice is dead on the money. It was  silly that they picked 16 principles because that was the number on Joe's jersey -- but all 16 of them are actually practical/useful. 

Another reviewer said this wasn't sliced bread -- but if you listen to them and actually put their principles into practice -- in business, relationships, sports et cetera --you will definitely come out on top.

Recommendation: Buy. If you're going to get advice, get it from the best
