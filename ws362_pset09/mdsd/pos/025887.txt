I really enjoyed this book.  It was highly entertaining with a thought provoking concept.  Basicly it is about the relationship between a woman and a man who, for unknown medical reasons, involuntarily time travels to different periods in his life, past and future.  Even after finishing this book, you will keep thinking about it for some time.  I reccomend it
