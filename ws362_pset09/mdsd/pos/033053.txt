Lacey has been traumatized after the brutal murder of her  beautiful sister by a serial killer.  She decides to take control of her fears and revenge her sister by tracking her killer herself, hence she becomes a brilliant FBI agent.  So years goes by..and its 7 years later...

While in FBI training boot camp, she meets the well known computer whiz/FBI special agent Dillion, who also heads some FBI department that specializes in tracking killers.  After an impressive drill/test, Dillion asks the department to assign Lacey to his force.  Fortunately for her, this would allow her to track her sisters killer on the side.  While all this is going on, the killer strikes again in Boston, her brother-in-law seems to be  falling for her, Dillions ex who also works in the same department send her the evil jealous eye, and her family seems to be looney as ever with her insane mother hinting at her father trying to kill her.   Not to mention falling in love for the first time since her sisters death...

This book was a page turner, really well paced and kept me guessing til the end.  However, the romance btw Lacey and Dillion didnt seem all that hot to be honest.  They went from being totally professional to being in bed one night to talking about marriage, er yea... it just didnt seem all that real, the romance between these two seemed forced, more like an after thought.  

Don;t read this book expecting great romance, you'll get disappointed... but since the suspense/mystery is so great you wont even care.  Overall its time  and money well spent
