Those who know Java will probably most appreciate this tale of Javanese politics before and during WW1. However, it is a very well-written and extremely poignant story of how the oppressed gradually free themselves through the valiant, but often misguided, efforts of heros, and also how "power corrupts" even those who are aware of the homily and start out to be incorruptable. I read this last book of the Buru Quartet first, and it seems to not be a bad way to do it. I will go on to the first one. Most likely these are going to be classics in the fields of Literature,  Socialogy, and Political Science.
