I LOVED THIS BOOK AND ITS ABOSOLUTELY AWESOME, NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST FEW, BUT STILL GOOD!!! WHAT HAPPENS IS... AMY GOES TO A SHOW WITH STORM AND SEES ASHLEE TAKE A FALL OFF HER HORSE, LATER ON ASHLEE TURNS UP UNEXPECTEDLY ASKING AMY FOR HELP, ALL THE WHILE AMY IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHATS WRONG WITH BOXER, THE NEWEST HORSE AT HEARTLAND!!! WELL ID BETTER STOP THERE BEFORE I GIVE TO MUCH AWAY!!! LIKE I SAID, AN AWESOME BOOK, AND WELL WORTH READING!!! TO ALL THE HEARTLAND FANS OUT THERE, I HAVE A FAN GROUP!!! ..
