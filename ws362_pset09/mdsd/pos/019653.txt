An interesting collection of plans to build everything from emergency shelters to a log home without using purchased building materials.  Contains much information on building authentic log structures of numerous designs.   Plans for building authentic doors and latches, windows, and furnishing for &quot;rustic&quot; homes are also included.  A chapter is included for those of us who have always wanted a log home but can't get the spouse to agree--a rustic log room or den &quot;hidden&quot; inside a modern home.  I had a copy of the original for years before losing it in a fire and look very forward to replacing it.  Thanks Amazon.co
