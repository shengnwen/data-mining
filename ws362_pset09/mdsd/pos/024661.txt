Ok, so in the beginning it was slow, and I was wondering why all the putting around with the petty stuff.  Then, it became more intense after about 50 pages.  Halfway through the book I couldn't even put it down!   I  was staying up so late at night to keep reading!  The plot was complex and  very well written.  It kept me involved wondering what would befall the  crew next!  One of the best, rivaling only the TOS book, but quickly  becoming my favorite.  It's VERY intense at the end
