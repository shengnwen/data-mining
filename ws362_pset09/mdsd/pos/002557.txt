I haven't really enjoyed this series for the past few installments. However, I did enjoy this one. And that's because the story wasn't overfilled with the annoying sidekicks, Illuminada and Betty.

Both characters have outworn themselves in this series, having turned into a couple of unlikeable, stereotypical caricatures. Illuminada, the impatient Cuban, can't get through a paragraph without throwing out a "chiquita" and looking at her watch. Betty, the controlling African-American, can't get through a paragraph without throwing out a "girlfriend" and barking out orders. These two got old a long time ago, and the series is just so much more enjoyable when Bel is interacting with Sol, Ma, Sofia, Wendy, her kids and her students. 

Hopefully the author has realized this and the series will continue in a positive manner, as it did with this installment
