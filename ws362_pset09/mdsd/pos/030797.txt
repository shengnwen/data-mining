Webster's "The Burma Road" is an in-depth look at an often over looked theater during World War II. He does a great job showing how difficult it was for the American Command to try to induce the wavering and self-bickering Chinese to fully enter the war, something they never did. Webster also does a great job highlighting Merrell's Marauder's, that group of commandos that fought the Japanese so successfully in Burma.
But the main theme of the book is the effort of the Allies to try to re-open the vital Burma Road, linking India, through Burma, to China, to bring much needed resources to beleaguered China, suffering under the heal of the ever oppressive Japanese.
A great read for Military History enthusiasts and any who love a good read.
