This book allows one to get as full of picture as possible of the the Washingto thought process during the Spanish American War period and America's subjugation of the Philippine islands.   This is not a boring history read and offers parrallels into the current washington political crowd and our war in Iraq.  Thr projection of America's culture and values was tried in The Philippines with some success but we should realize that in the end Americans are from America and Filipinos are from the Philippines and Iraqis are from Iraq and will ALWAYS be different.  The book is written very intelligently and won the nobel prize for Karnow.  If you like History, if you like Politics, then you should like this book.
