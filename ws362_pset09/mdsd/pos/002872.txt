Wrapped in Rainbows sends us back but forwards in the description of one full life rocketed from north Florida to New York to the Islands to New Orleans and never stopping much to pause for one single breath of why but only how she was tornadic action and called Zora Neale Hurston and she was so proud and beguiling and she left me at 9:21pm on the 27th day of January in mourning for more life and more Nora as the last page stopped.There will be no return to ordinary folk after you have read this fine tribute to such a driven figure, only to most an imagination and to a few a beacon light for self belief
