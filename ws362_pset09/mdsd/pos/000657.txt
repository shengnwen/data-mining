What a wonderful read.  The Book of Air and Shadows by Michael Gruber is the reason most of us read.  Richly complex and yet sleak in plot, The Book of Air rewards the reader on every page.  

Taking the reader on a trip that spans continents and about 400 years, Gruber spins the story with spidery threads that connect New York, England, and Switzerland.  Rich characters such as Jake Mishkin, Carolyn Rolly, and Albert Crosetti enhance the authors ability to tell the story.  

I'd say that The Book of Air is a pretty fair representation of what could happen if an original manuscript of an unpublished story by the bard himself were to turn up.  The fast paced story might be a bit slow getting off the ground, but once its going hold on.  

Jake Mishkin in hiding and waiting to be bumped off.  As he waits he tells us the story that has lead to his situation.  And what a story..... 

This is a terrific story told by a gifted author
