Checker has another hit on their hands with their reprint series of Alex Raymond's FLASH GORDON.  Presented in oblong 12 x 9&quot; hardcover format, this makes for an attractive, if somewhat awkward, format for collecting these classic strips.  I say &quot;awkward&quot; because oblong editions don't store easily on the bookshelf, but the benefit is that you get the strips in their original format.  In any case, it's great to see Raymond's original strips back in print.  This edition introduces Flash Gordon and his travelling companions Dale Arden and Dr. Zarkov, as well as the interplanetary comrades and enemies we all know and love (or love to hate).  Reproduction is fair: the linework is a bit light, and the colors are too soft for my tastes.  Better reproduction quality, plus a higher page count, would have netted this book five stars
