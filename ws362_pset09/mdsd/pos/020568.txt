 Michael Connelly used to be a crime journalist. THat's why I think this mystery, which has a journalist as the main character (a guy named Jack McEvoy) works so very well, with every scene jumping off the page and certain scenes making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up!  
    Now about the plot...McEvoy's brother, a cop, is dead and the death is declared a suicide. But McEvoy doesn't buy it, knowing his brother as well as he does. Of course, others think he is simply in "denial" but as McEvoy digs deeper, suspicious patterns start to emerge, linking cop "suicides" with a network of pedophiles and, in particular, one pedophile, nicknamed "The Poet" for his use of lines of Poe poems, lines which he leaves at the scenes of his crimes. 
    Every chapter, every page, seems realistic, believable. I was immediately riveted and even though I did sense the killer before the final pages, it took nothing away from reading a book so well-crafted with such fine detais. Connelly made me feel like I was walking around IN McEvoy's shoes, looking through his eyes. 
    So there you have it - a bare plot outline and an opinion about a very fine writer. I DO suggest you start with this book, as Connelly's quality can go up and down from book to book - or perhaps some of his works simply resonate with me more than others. This book is a top notch mystery
