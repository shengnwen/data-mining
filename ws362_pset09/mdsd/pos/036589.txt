The Electric Michelangelo by Sara Hall is a 2004 Man Booker finalist, and is a lyrical novel about carnivals, freak shows and tattoo artists. It spans two world wars and moves from the English seaside to Coney Island. This book is a beautifully written narrative with minimal dialogue, and the characters are certainly memorable, but I had to push myself to finish it and found myself skimming pages. The bizarre world where the main character lived was one that I really didn't care to linger in for as long as this book took to read. Hall certainly knows how to shock, and the pain and suffering in this book is without reprieve. None of the characters are easily likeable. 
After saying all that, I know this is a book that had an impact, and many of the incredible, poetic images that this author conjurs up will not be easily forgotten.This is one of the most original novels I have read this year. I would recommend this book as a thought-provoking read.
