I found this book to be very helpful in buiding my manuscript and taking it to the next level.  By using examples of breakout novels, Donald Maass goes through all the important elements used to write a stunning piece of fiction.  I found the section on characters to be especially helpful.  In my opinion, I feel this book will be most helpful to those that already have some basic experience with writing.  I highly recommend this book to writers who want to make their novel standout from the rest, and capture the attention of agents, publishers, and most important of all, the readers.
