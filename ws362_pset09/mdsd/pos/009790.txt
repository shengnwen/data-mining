This is the most definitive military study of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It vividly records the planning and execution of the war plan, acquaints the reader with the view of military commanders on the ground, and records the battles they fought.

The civilian Pentagon leadership is profiled with a unique (chronological) record of independent advice (eg. troop levels) received from outside sources. Perhaps the best example is Doug Macgregor (sponsored by Newt Gingrich), who thought 5,500 troops could win victory (an additional 15,000 would subsequently be needed to secure peace).

The only rival for this volume is Rick's `Fiasco." Both are well worth reading
