Well, I must say that upon reading this book, I felt like I was a part of the Vachon men's lives. This book was wonderful and exciting. However, I think that there was a bit more intrigue to The Edge of Dawn than to this one. Passion, passion, passion. WOW! I am looking forward to another Beverly Jenkins book. I am about to buy the others that have been published before
