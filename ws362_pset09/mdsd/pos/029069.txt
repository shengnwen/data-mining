It gives you a better appreciation of your tough times and how to accept them and not deny them.
I would like to make a note here. I find the comment of "Teri M. Oneal" pretty disturbing when she/he says "It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters". If the author shares his experiences with us, or anyone for that matter, it is our duty as a mature adult person not to use it against him or her. If one does not appreciate another one's opinion, one can come up with reasoning. Moking or taking advantage of one's trust is the least mature action one can do.
