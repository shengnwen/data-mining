This was one of the first books I bought on trading while I was doing it part time. I was struck by all of the parallels between what he had experienced and what I was experiencing in my trading.

I enjoyed his breezy no nonsense style of writing and the fact that he delivers what he promises, how HE trades for a living. I emphasize HE because if you are a trader It is doubtful that you will trade like him...mutual funds with no technical analysis.

Having said that I did benefit from some of his techniques and discovered a few sentiment indicators that I had not used previously.

I would recommend this book as a complement to a good T.A book like Tom O'Briens Timing The Trade. Together you should have most of your bases covered
