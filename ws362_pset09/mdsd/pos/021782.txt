I bought the book just because my teacher of elementary philosophy in the university respected Tarski as a master of formal logic. It took me 26 years to get this book in my hands. What makes Tarski unique is, that he was a great logician and a great teacher, too.

I belive that there still are no better guide for a student who wants to understand logic, not just try to remember basic rules of it. The beauty of logic has never been exposed in a better way.

The fifth star was spared to a new, annotated edition of this classic among the field of logic. I hope I can find one some day
