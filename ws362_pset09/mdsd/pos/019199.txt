Easy to follow, this book is a good place to start learning about growing and using herbs. In addition to clear explanations on making tinctures, poultices, teas, baths, etc. there are recipes and suggestions for seasonal celebrations.  The fact that it covers not only medicinal uses but also culinary and gift making makes it a valuable beginners book on the diverse uses of herbs.

As a green witch,  I liked the chance to learn about herbs commonly used in magick from a different perspective.  It gave me ideas on how to use these gifts from the Earth in a way that still represents my beliefs yet allows me to share it them with others in different forms other than incense or potions
