As someone interested in the creationist/evolution debate, this short but well-articulated book is one that I would recommend to anyone with a similar interest.  The NAS not only oversees a plethora of scientific investigation but is a body well respected for it's thoroughness and objectivity in the vast realm we call scientific inquiry. 'Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences'  brings together the thoughts and evidence of leading researchers debating one of society's most polarizing topics.
