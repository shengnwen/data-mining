Room by Hubert Selby Jr is a slow painful ride into Hell.  This isn't the path to the fiery pits but, to null.  In this book Selby presents a man who is slowly and inexorably losing his mind in prison.  The Room is no fast paced page turner, this book isn't for those seeking instant literary gratification.  Both the pace and Selby's style of little punctuation and long thick paragraphs can make for a tedious read at times but, in my opinion this book is worth sticking with.

Room delves into the sick fantasies of a man locked not only in prison but in his own head.  His decline is vividly and painfully described in scenes that run the gambit from bittersweet memories of first sexual fumblings to highly detailed sado-masochistic visions of vengance.  All in all The Room delivers.  I recommend this book for those willing to take the long way to madness.
