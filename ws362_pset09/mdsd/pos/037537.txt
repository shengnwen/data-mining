I'm laughing as I write this because I can't figure out exactly why I liked the book as much as I did. There's very little action; there's no Hawk; the whodunnit is a given, the whydunnit isn't all that suspenseful; there's no development of Spenser's backstory, no compelling new character(the only repeat character is Rita Fiore who's as one-dimensional as ever), and it may be the shortest novel of the year. (At the roughly $15 hardcover price you're paying more than double what you pay for a movie and getting about the same amount of time to be entertained.)But it was a better than average Spenser, which makes it a considerably better than average action-mystery. Maybe it was Spenser on his own,with no Susan (until the very end, when it doesn't matter), no endless romantic musings about Susan, no racial fireworks or needless moralizing, just a tough, smart guy going about his pretty interesting job.
Bottom line - if you haven't read Spenser before, don't start here. Go back to the beginning and read your way along. (I re-read the whole series last summer; it will take you about a day per volume.) If you read him sporadically, you'll probably like this more than some and less than others. If you've read all the others, you'll have already read it anyway and don't need to bother with reviews like this.
