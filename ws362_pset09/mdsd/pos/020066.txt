I'm only half through the book, but I think that it is very interesting. If you are looking for light, middle-of-the-day reading this book is NOT for you. But if you are looking for a book that takes your mind to another place and really makes you think and recall historical events, this book is definitely for you. This context can be random at points, and cause me to take out my dictionary a few times, it is most definitely worth reading- that is why I give The Anatomy of Revolution 4 stars
