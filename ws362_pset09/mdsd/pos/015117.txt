Ann Brashares does a great job in this sequel to "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants". I enjoyed all the new twists, turns and surprising events in the book. Lena is suffering from love, Bridget is overcoming slight depression, Tibby is off at college learning really who is important to her and Carmen starts to date along with her Mom and she has to deal with that. The pants at first didn't have their magical fit like they did last year right away. But through the summer the pants eventually sprang back into their action.

The girls have known each other since they were all babies, but remember the toddler days, as their Moms did a pregnancy workout class together and were all due in the month of September. After the girls' births the Moms found ways to have play dates and have fun as Moms. As the mothers stayed in touch through their years so did the girls. Even now as they are all about 17 they are closer than ever.

In the first book, it was the first summer of their separation; a summer where they were all apart. Last summer they found themselves in new ways and discovered new things. This is the second summer of the sisterhood and how the adventures live on and change.

The book leaves you with just as many questions as the last. I recommend this book to girls 13-18 years old and I also recommend that you read the first book before this one. The book mentions Brian, Kostcos, Bapi and Bailey from the first book. I can't wait to get my hands on the third book!
