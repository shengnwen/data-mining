After reading this Bernie Rhodenbarr novel, I look forward to reading others. The characters are entertaining and the dialogue between them is engrossing. The meandering conversations almost threaten to overshadow the central storyline, but they're still engaging enough to keep you glued to the page. The solution to the mystery is everything it should be: unpredictable, credible, and satisfying. If you're looking for a mystery with quirky characters, a smudge of suspense, and a good sense of humor, THE BURGLAR IN THE RYE is a perfect choice
