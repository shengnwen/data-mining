Although the narrative is a bit uneven, this book provides a lot of details on the Beatles' disintegration from a legal and business perspective.  It was, after all, a legal and business breakup rather than an artistic hiatus.  
The analysis and insights are very good because the book was written nearly contemporaneously with the breakup.  As such, the authors spoke with most of the main players: Allen Klein, John Lennon, John Eastman, Lee Eastman, Neil Aspinal, Derek Taylor, Clive Epstein, investment bankers, etc.  They also poured over the court documents from Paul's lawsuit.  The analysis is helped by the fact that one of the author's was pursuing an MBA and had a good undestanding of the contested stock deals involved with Northern Songs, NEMS, etc.
Hopefully someone will republish this important little book.  If you want to understand the Beatles and their breakup, you really have no choice, get this book
