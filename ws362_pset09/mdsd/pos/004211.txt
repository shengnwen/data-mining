	Swish!  That was the day that Richie Walker became a legend and Danny Walker  had a lot to live up to.  Danny Walker a 50 inch tall seventh grader ha s a hard  time living up to his and everyone else's expectations in the town called Middletown.  His dad, Richie Walker, won the national championship on ESPN when he was in seventh grade.  But he got dicorvorced from Danny's mom so Danny now lives with his mom. Now  it is Danny's turn to win the national chamionship except for he gets cut from the team for being too small. The couch of this team is none other than Mr. Ross, a former teammate of Richies But does he still hold a grudge for not being the star of the team 30 years ago?  His son Ty Ross, is the best basketball player in town.  But will the grudge between the two dads keep Ty and Danny from being friends?  Richie starts a new team so his son can play basketball this season.  But will a car accident keep him from coaching the team?  You will have to read Travel Team to find out what happens to Danny and Richie.

	I think this book was a very exciting book to read.  For example, after Danny had broken Ty's arm while playing basketball the two boys were still able to become friends and pla basketball together.  When Danny and Teddy Moran started fighting because Teddy insulted his dad.  I also thought that the book had a lot of twists in it.  When Ty quit his dad's team and joined Danny's team, because Ty's dad was way too hard on tim.  I didn't like the tension between Richie Walker and Mr. Ross.  I didn't think anyone would hold a grudge for 30 years, and then get back at the person.  But I think it was a very good book overall.  I would give Travel Team 4 out of 5 stars. If you don't read this book I will be very disapointed because it is a very good book
