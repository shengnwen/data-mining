If you are a fan of Charles Mingus' music, you will certainly enjoy this wonderfully bombastic character in his autobiography.  His story has his life woven in with some fictionalized characters and segments  &quot;jazzed&quot; in, which adds quite a peculiar nature to his work.   However, you will never guess what segments are true and which aren't.  The  work is very peculiar as an autobiography, revealing more the conversations  and the feelings he underwent through his travels as opposed to a straight  narrative from beginning to end.  His work goes through a path of  flashbacks and such, with a major emphasis on women (esp. his lovers), the  road, and his jazz music. The interesting people he meets in his travels  are well interweaved, and really make the story.  My only criticism is when  this &quot;jazz&quot; story starts to ramble out into peculiar segments  which seem to lose your attention.  The work tends to well reflect the  chaotic nature of this genius.  It is also a treat to listen to his music  while reading... One of the many pleasures I've undertaken in.  Highly  recommended reading
