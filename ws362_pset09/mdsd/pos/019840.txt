This book was a childhood favorite of mine in the mid 1960s--introduced to me by my mother, a teacher of French language. It's a bittersweet tale --but ultimately it's an affirming book. I loved it so much as a child that I have always remembered it--and now plan to introduce it to my children. The photographs are beautiful and charming. My love of this book probably explains why I always feel happy when I see a big red balloon.  A gem and a classic
