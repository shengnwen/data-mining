The first time I saw this movie, there was one scene which scared me; the scene where Mary's parents are dying from the plague (I think it was cholera?). The music they use for this can send chills down someone's back; I know because it did mine.

Apart from that, I loved the movie. I don't know why they had to have Dickon killed, though. (Ben Weatherstaff and Mary talk at the end of the movie; we find out that Dickon was killed in the war.)

I like how Colin and Mary meet at the end and how Mary held off on saying yes to Colin's marriage proposal until they were together in the garden. 

Something else I'm wondering: Was this movie set during World War 1 or World War 2?
