&quot;The Englishman's Daughter&quot; is wonderfully well researched and written. I've been doing extensive research on this exact time period and place on the Picardy plain as background for a novel. I found (with one minor exception) Macintyre's descriptions and context to be nearly flawless. He has expertly packaged most of what I have gleaned (and much more because his narrative includes French and German points of view for an extended time frame), into an accessible, multidimensional story. It offers a perspective on WW1 that is both more nuanced and timeless than most novels. Read it for the love story, the history or to solve the mystery and be broadened by the other aspects. This book is a marvel
