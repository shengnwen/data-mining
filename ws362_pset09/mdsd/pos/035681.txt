_Walkin' the Dog_ is closer to being a novel than the previous stories featuring the menacingly large reformed ex-con Socrates Fotlow, _Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned_. Repetitions of basic information about the characters is rarer. If the stories were published separately, there is no indication of credits. 

Socrates remains a compelling figure. He continues to develop, as he manages rage that is often provoked. Unfortunately, his quasi-son Daryl doesn't grow (as a character). 

The final chapter/story in the book is particularly gripping, though I remain uncertain that someone conditioned to self-preservation in a long prison sentence would undertake such dangerous public protest. Several non-black, mostly Latino people champion him in his confrontations with police, developers, and coworkers. Mosley's prose is always compelling and any sentimentality rubs against a world of Brechtian pressures and troubles
