I was delightfully surprised at the complex view of family that this book takes.  If the reader is holding a rigid American -conservative "Christian" view of family, then this book will be utter torture. It challenges how Christians of today look back a view generations and idolize the "family" of that time as the ideal biblical family.  However, with Jack Balswick's keen sociological perspective, he is able to create in the reader an awareness that each believing generation struggles with the issue of what if means to be a biblical, Christ-honoring family. The Balswicks finish the book with a hard look, sociologically and theologically, at the current state of the family in our culture.  They clarify exacltly what is happening to families inside and outside of the church, and consider some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Church's response to these current cultural and familial trends. If you're looking for a book that is going to exegete texts to prove a formula for the biblical family, well, pass this one up.  However, if you're looking for a work that considers the greater themes of Scripture, the overriding character of God as Father, and how you can navigate the insanity of our current cultural state without moving to the vacant spaces of Idaho, then delve into this one and expect to be challenged, encouraged, and equipped
