The chapter on statistics in this book alone makes it essential reading for anyone interested in liberal thinking. Sowell points out the methodological flaw in almost all "studies" touted by the media as evidence of racism: that they are instances of data mining; i.e., of "fishing" for numbers that support a result, even though other numbers from the same data contradict that result. For example, is it evidence of racism that blacks are rejected for mortgage loans more than whites or are laid off more than whites when whites are rejected for such loans and laid off more than Asians? Is the average white American therefore racist against whites, preferring Asians? Or are such discrepancies better explained by other factors? Can the fact that blacks perform worse on mental tests than whites be attributed to "language" or "discrimination" when Asian immigrants, for whom English is often a second language, perform much better than white Americans? This is eye-opening stuff. Anyone interested in statistical methodology will find his discussion of the "residual fallacy" absolutely fascinating. Sowell is an important American thinker, and it is a shame he is not more widely read and appreciated. Social policies should be framed as empirical predictions to be tested calmly and dispassionately by data, and not as ideological moral crusades to be championed even when the data suggests they have failed miserably
