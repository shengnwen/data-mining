Most people will not consider this book one of Balzac's best, but I think this collection has some very interesting stories nonetheless. The main theme of each of these stories is love and passion seen through the eyes of  Parisians. Some of these passages I consider some of Balzac's best; they  are memorable words for anyone who has fallen hopelessly in love. The  thoughts and observations of the characters within this collection of books  is simply amazing
