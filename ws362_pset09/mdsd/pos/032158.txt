Losing your only child in a drunk driving accident is devastating enough, but when the inebriated driver behind the wheel turns out to be an old high school friend, an unthinkable volcano of emotions erupts. That's the scenario Megan Van Dorn and her husband Rex are facing when they decide to leave their lives behind and find solace on the deep blue ocean. Alone and adrift, Meg and Rex soon find that while you might be able to run from your circumstances, you can never hide from the haunting memories. On their journey, the Van Dorns encounter other sea-drifters, just like them, who are trying to escape their own demons, and through these individuals they discover that there are never easy answers. In Blue Water, Ansay asks the burning question: "How can one live in a world like this, and then keep on living, after it happens?" The novel brings to the light the varying ways in which we grieve and move on with our lives following an unspeakable tragedy. As someone who has lost a loved one to a drunk driver, I can attest that it does so quite effectively.
