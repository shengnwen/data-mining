Stephen Hawking, one of the most prominent geniuses of our time, called George Smoot and his colleagues' discovery of wrinkles in time, &quot;the scientific discovery of the century, if not of all time.&quot;  The  cosmological discovery of ripples in the universe's background radiation  has indeed changed our concept of the origins of an expanding and evolving  universe.  In the words of George Smoot:          &quot;Our discovery of  the wrinkles in the fabric of time is part of that eternal quest and marks  an important step forward in this golden age of technology.  Suddenly,  pieces of a larger puzzle begin to fall together: Inflation looks stronger,  and dark matter more real.  Our faith in the big bang is revitalized...   The creativity of the universe is its most potent force, forming through  time the matter and structures of stars and galaxies, and, ultimately, us.   The wrinkles are the core of that creativity, assembling structure from  homogeneity.&quot; 	Perhaps one does not understand such complex terms  as &quot;background  radiation,&quot; as was my case when I began reading  Wrinkles in Time.   The authors,  George Smoot and Keay Davidson,  successfully explain these complicated  concepts in lay terms.  The book  first guides the reader through the history modern  cosmological theory,  beginning with Ptolemy's picture of the Universe through to  the origin of  the Big Bang theory formulated by Georges-Henri Lemaître. 	Once the  reader understands the evolution of cosmology and astrophysics,  George  Smoot begins his detailed account of the search for &quot;dipoles,&quot;   &quot;quadrupoles,&quot; and, ultimately, &quot;wrinkles in time.&quot;   His discovery, of tremendous  significance to both science and philosophy,  required decades of research, billions of dollars, and a highly specialized  team of cosmologists, physicists, chemists, and engineers.  After many  frustrating attempts to discover the secret of the universe by launching  their equipment on giant helium balloons and World War II U2 aircraft,  Smoot and his team turned to NASA.  After many months of hard work, they  finally saw their instruments launched into space on a Delta rocket.  Once  in orbit, the device detected what the team sought to find. However, one  can never be too confident in science.  To make sure that the readings  obtained in space were not simply a result of radio interference, the team  set off for Antarctica.  There, only a few miles away from the South Pole,  and at temperatures of -73oF, George Smoot and Giovanni D Amici, among  others, confirmed what they had detected in the Northern Hemisphere:  fluctuations in the universe' background radiation.  These wrinkles in time  are the seeds of galaxies; some found through the study to be hundreds  times larger than ever imagined. 	The implications of this discovery  are colossal.  Wrinkles in Time, however, does not elaborate on the  philosophical significance of an infinite universe as do some other works.   For example, Gary Zukav's The Dancing Wu Li Masters and Fritjof Capra's The  Tao of Physics advance the notion that the universe bloomed out of zero  volume, creating time and space as it grew.  For readers who have never  picked up a science book in their lives, do not start with Wrinkles in  Time.  There are long, detailed chapters that explain the technicalities of  the equipment and of the study.  On the other hand, for anyone interested  in learning about mystifying concepts of the universe, Wrinkles in Time is  an enlightening book that is well worth the time investment of a prolonged  reading.  As John L. Casti, author of Paradigms Lost: Images of Man in the  Mirror of Science, affirms, the book is &quot;a must read for anyone  interested in the way science is really done.&quot
