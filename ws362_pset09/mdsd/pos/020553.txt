Several other reviewers say this book is out of date. In some ways, yes. But some of the most important points of this book still seem valid.

Specifically: 
1.) Art is an artificial market whose value is talked up by art historians and gallery owners. 
2.) The depiction of the female nude in art has always contained a exploitative voyeuristic overtone. 
3.) The measure of man's power lies in who they can have power over.
4.) The measure of woman's power lies in who can have power over them.

It's small surprise his opinions were buried by academia and the art establishment. These were never popular opinions, but taken in the context of art history and the art market they provide a great counterpoint.

Even now, this book is a great way to demystify the art market for the art student
