We used this as our textbook for a course on "The Art of Film" at my university.  It's packed with a lot of great detail, obviously written by someone who knows and loves the subject.  The problem is that it's not as well organized as it could be.  For example, the authors will make a comment along the lines of "there are three important reasons why X works the way it does."  Then you spend the next 28 pages trying to find the three reasons (since you KNOW you're going to be tested on this), which are usually buried among a lot of very interesting details.  A few well-placed paragraph and sub-paragraph headings would help alleviate the need to play "where's Waldo" with important concepts.

My other beef isn't so much with the content of the book but with McGraw-Hill's penchant for printing paperback textbooks like this one on the **heaviest** paper they can find.  Not that the paper is thicker or more durable or anything, it just weighs a TON.  Add a couple of these tomes to your backpack, and it's off to the chiropractor.  The paper also has a kind of "sheen" to it that makes it very difficult to read under library lights (most lights, for that matter) due to the glare that appears on the pages.  I usually end up holding the book at some odd angle just to be able to see through the bright spots.  Obviously, this is not something the authors necessarily have any control over, but I believe it deserves mention.

I would have given this book a rating of 4.5 had that been an option, as the content IS quite good.  Over the course of my class, I've been making a list of "movies I must see before I die" based on some of the comments and examples used in this book.  As I mentioned above, the biggest problem is organization, and unless you're a student with limited time, this probably wouldn't be an issue
