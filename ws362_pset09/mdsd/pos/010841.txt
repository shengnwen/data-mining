"Valley of the Dolls" is pure fun. It's got great characters--from the small town girl trying to make it in the big city to the actress who needs to feel real to the singer who wants it all. Reading this, I was reminded of today's soap operas and also other novels of this genre. It was, for me, a fun read, though sometimes a little dark. It's an older book but I think it's withstood the test of time. I definitely recommned it, along with "Take Your Shirt Off" or anything by Jackie Collins.
