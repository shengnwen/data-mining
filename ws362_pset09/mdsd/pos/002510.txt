With this novel, Balzac continued to place himself among the most influential and appreciated writers of world literature. Balzac, along with Shakespeare, gave a new meaning to the word &quot;human&quot;.  This is an  extraordinary and rich novel narrating the glory and downfall of Colonel  Chabert. I won't summarize the whole work here since I imagine that you  have had enough of that so far, so I will just say that this novel is about  a human being's inability to re-enter a society that has long forgotten  about him. The imagery in this novel is extraordinary and a wonderful scene  occurs when the Colonel is first described: poking through the  darkness...like a Rembrandt and that careful construction of light and  darkness. It is exquisite! Don't miss this novel. If you like this one, I  recommend: Le Pere Goriot, Eugenie Grandet, Cousine Bette, and La Peau de  Chagrin. Enjoy
