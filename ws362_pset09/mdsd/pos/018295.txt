As a future teacher in the public school system, I find Dewey's words affirming my own "educative experience" that I've received in both traditional and progressive schools. Indeed, it's more difficult to teach progressively, yet, I believe it is what is urgently needed in today's educational system, where the future leaders of this country are raised and taught. This book is a classic in pedegogy, a must read.
