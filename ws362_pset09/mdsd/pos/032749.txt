And plenty of snow there is, adding proper atmosphere to a brooding mystery.  Good character development, plausible (most of the time) plot lines, some weird characters, painted so as to generate maximum hatred or respect.  When the lady from the Forest Service first appears, you almost can hear readers hissing all across America.  When the sheriff gets snide with Pickett, you want to relish what you hope will be his humiliation before the book ends.  Scenes at the snowed-in Pickett household are poignant in light of future plot turns.  A good page turner, with nicely done descriptions of the Big Horn Mountain area of almost-mystical Wyoming.  May you write long and well, C.J. Box
