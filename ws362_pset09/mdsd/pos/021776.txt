I would like to deffinitly recommend this book to anyone with a good reading level because I found this book very interesting and I happen to love animals.    Dr. Doolitle is a naturalist who talks to animals and keeps a private zoo in his garden and plays the flute.  Tommy Stubbins longs to join someone on a ship and go sailing, so Dr. Doolitle takes him in as an assistant to help him. On their adventure they encounter several stowaways on the boat and the doctor has a bullfight without killing the bulls. I would definitely recommend this book and it keeps you on the edge of your seat
