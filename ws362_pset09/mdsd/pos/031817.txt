This book is very good for Beginners to Intermediate Level Photo Enthusiasts. It has couple of tips and examples which the reader has to grasp and note down till they start using it and make familiar with it. Overall a Great Book for the price with pictures, explanation, Shutter Speed and Aperture values. Lot of new photography students wonder hey how did you get this picture ? What shutter speed and Aperture did you use ? The book indirectly gives you all the answers. Spend time reading it (no Rush) and you will explore new techniques which you can practically use and implement. I Recommend this book
