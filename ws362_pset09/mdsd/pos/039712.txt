The Revised Core rules fixed much of what was wrong with the old core rulebook. The classes (and prestige classes) are much better. More flexibility for dark side PC's is available. Skills and Feats make more sense and aren't nearly as munchkined as they were before.

The downside is that they don't list nearly enough starships. There is no method to upgrade starships or create custom ships (that's all in Starships of the Galaxy, which is long out of print). Also there are no rules for cyberware (those are in the also out of print Hero's Guide).

Beyond that, the players I am running the Revised SW rpg in are avid d20 haters and despised the old rules, but they are all raving about the new "fixed" rules. Never thought I'd see them praise a d20 product, so if they like it, it's GOT to be good.

Warning: there are few, if any d20 products supporting the revised rules, so be prepared to hunt down conversion rules on wizards website or make them up on your own.

That being said, SSotG (if you can get a copy) is easy to convert to d20, just double the   listed Damage resistance for Hull Points and give the shields the same DR as the hull.
The cyberware rules in Hero's guide needs no modification that I  can see.
The skills and feats in all the non RCR books are still gimped, so be careful in allowing them into your RCR campaign.

Good luck and may the force (or darkside if you prefer) be with you.
