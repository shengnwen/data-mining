Having read all of Ludlum's books, this was the first "inspired by" novel that I read.  The novel starts slowly, and keeps on going a bit faster, and ends very fast paced.  I liked the book and it does keep with the Ludlum spirit.  From some reason it simply took me a very long time to read.

If you enjoy Ludlum's novels you will enjoy this one also, albeit maybe not each and every word.
