This inspirational book celebrates women in a beautiful way.  Each page contains a sentence that begins with She...and follows with an empowering statement about women. (For example, "She ran ahead where there were no paths.....Celebrate her bravery.") The design of the book is soothing and uplifting and goes along with the theme of the book. Great gift idea for any woman and if you are a woman, be sure to get a copy for yourself too!
