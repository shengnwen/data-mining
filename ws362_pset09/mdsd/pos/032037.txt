This is a great light cookbook.  It is mostly made up of new recipes to try but does have some revamped soul food favorites.  I love the authenticy of this book, as a diabetic Patti has to eat this way and because she's a great cook, the recipes are wonderful. I am especially fond of the layered banana pudding.

Patti does not provide tips to lighten up other recipes.  You can take these recipes at face value and experiment with your collection to see what works to lighten them up.  

Nutrition information is included for each recipe.  I enjoy the book because there are photos and stories from Patti's life
