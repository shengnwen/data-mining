   If you have five minutes, you can read something in this book that will inspire you. If you have hours in which to peruse it, it will likely change your life.

   I've given copies of this book to around three dozen friends in Australia and Europe and across the United States. The feedback has been unanimously positive. Most of the recipients have asked me to thank Paul Loeb for putting together such an amazing, diverse collection of writings that give us hope in seemingly dark times.

   Loeb is a selfless individual who inspires many through his ongoing efforts to make this a better world and to help those of us who inhabit that world to become better citizens. He cuts through much of the media hype that overwhelms us and gets right to the essence of what is needed to improve our present situation. Both in person and through the writings collected here (as well as in his other books and articles), Loeb lets us know that we can indeed make a difference -- wherever we are, whatever our ages, backgrounds, and skills. There are no excuses for inaction.

   To my mind, if everyone in the United States read this book, we would be well on our way to healing, to once again being worthy of consideration as a truly great nation. The seeds sown here have the potential of sprouting enough gardens to last for generations
