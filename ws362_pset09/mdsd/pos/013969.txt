The Other Side of Russia emerged from Barbara Hudgins experience of living in Siberia for a year and a half, from 1993 to 1994.  Working as the onsite program coordinator for the University of Maryland University College in Siberia and the Russian Far East, she worked and lived in Vladivostok and Irkutsk.

Hudgins book is the first book about Siberia I'd come across written by someone who spent extensive time in Siberia.  This gives her a depth of understanding that adds a lot to her memoir.  

The structure of her memoir is unusual.  She's divided the book into two sections.  The chapters in part one focus on place - Irkutsk, Vladivostok, Lake Baikal, etc. - and the chapters in the second part focus on aspects of life and culture in Siberia - housing, education, food and festivals.  Hudgins supplemented her first-hand experience with extensive research.  This offers readers an in-depth source of information about many aspects of Siberian place and life.  

What's lost in this non-chronological format is Hudgin's own adaptations and reactions over her time in Siberia.  She does insert some feelings and personality, but the focus is on the topic, rather than on her personal experience or characters who change and develop over the period.

Hudgins seems to have thrown herself into Siberia with a remarkably open mind.  She expertly captures the small details of Siberian life and renders vivid pictures of feasts shared with Russian friends.  For those who have been to Siberia, this book will take you back there.  For those planning on going, The Other Side of Russia provides a great overview of the life and culture.
