I'll keep this review short, sweet and spoiler free. This is one of Terry Pratchett's slowest moving books, but stay with it and like all of the Discworld series the characters will grow on you and the events will lead up to one of Terry Pratchett's best climaxes. I dare any Discworld fan to try and not read the last sixty or so pages without a big stupid grin forming on their face.

I agree with the reviewers before me that this is not the book to choose as your introduction to the Discworld universe.
