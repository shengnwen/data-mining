John David Skrentny has written a profound and deeply enlightening look at the development of affirmative action. His examination of the co-option of the race and quota issues by the right wing in the early 1970's is a must  read for any student of history, politics, and American culture. A gifted  and highly readable author, Mr. Skrentny takes the reader on a cook's tour  of the social and political development of affirmative action. An excellent  compoanion volume to Hugh Graham's civil rights work. Highly recommended
