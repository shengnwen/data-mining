the way the book is written descriptively is what makes it the most enjoyable. I love the descriptions of the surprise dinner Mary Anne, her father, and Dawn planned for dawn's mother's birthday, but Mary Anne and Dawn got a surprise too, that their parents are getting married!!! And it was a beautiful wedding they had, though there were big changes they were all going to have to adjust to
