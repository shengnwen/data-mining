As an ex-South African, Myrna Rosen's cookbooks have always been absolutely outstanding. I have tasted Lesley Loon's cooking and that is always brilliant - so with the two of them writing this cookbook, how wrong can one go. I have tried a few recipes and they were delicious and easy to follow. All in all a fantastic buy and a great cookbook to have at home!
