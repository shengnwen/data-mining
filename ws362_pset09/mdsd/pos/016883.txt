     She's gutsy and candid and a bit naughty- I loved this book because of it's particular insightfulness. Joan makes sure that we "get" her essence. Although only slightly familiar with her music ; I have become much more so after reading about her passion and ambition. there are some great snapshots of people; of course we see Dylan from a slightly scorned woman perspective- but tale hasn't hurt this unwashed phenomenon's career one bit. Truly engaging is hearing firsthand from Joan what it is like to be flying high ( while selling records) to being tossed around as a second stringer as the fads shift. The chapter on Live Aid is a hoot- the "latest thing" was madonna of all people. I would love to read a sequel- C'mon Joan-let's go.
