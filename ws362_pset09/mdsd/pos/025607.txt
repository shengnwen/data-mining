Taylor's technical information was extremely helpful; giving me the courage to fire up 16,000 BTU's under a big stockpot of 400 degree oil!  His suggestion for using potatoes to clean used oil was a great insight.   After cleaning the oil, we tried the &quot;taters&quot;.  Yummy!   Recipes  are a nice addition to the terrific informative sections
