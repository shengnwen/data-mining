I'm not sure if Miss Kipnis is proposing a radical new state of social existence in Against Love or if she is an unusually keen observer of the human condition, or both.

It doesn't matter. Against Love is not only an entertaining read, but westerners (especially women, who actually think about this stuff) will find the book secretly, sinfully provocative, while struggling to come to terms with a philosophy most of them will find threatening: "Hummm sounds like fun.  Maybe. But what about the kids?  More hummm.  And what if my girlfriends decide they want to cheat on their husbands... with MY husband.  A girl could drive herself mad with all of the possibilities.  

But there's a way to read this book without coming away irredeemably frustrated.  First come to grips with the harsh reality that There Is No Answer to this most maddening of human pursuits, and that there never will be.   And that just when you've become a little to smart for your own good and decided "Forget monogamy and family values (a repellant phrase if ever there was one); from here on end I'm practicing serial polygammy;" along comes Fate and WHAM there you go again shopping for a sensible car and a neighborhood with Good Schools. Or maybe you're already in one of those Committed Relationships and that same Fate points all of your hormones in the direction of Forbidden Fruit. There are no rules, at least not that survive the end of the day. Miss Kipnis is a sharp gal and she obviously knows this. I can't see why she took a stand for poligamy or adultery, or why anyone would defend monogamy either.  But polemic sells. Enjoy the book.
