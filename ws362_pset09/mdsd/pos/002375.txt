I bought the book originally to add some variety to my training sessions and to obtain ideas on different exercises.  Now both my trainer and I do not jump without the book close by.  The different grid exercises have added so much to our workouts!  Not only has it helped our horses become more confident it has helped our equitation tremendously.  I would highly recommend this book for both beginers and the more experienced rider
