This was Ludlum's last book that was solely written by him before he died. Every book after this has been written by a ghost writer who still uses Ludlum's name on the cover. 

This book takes the reader through a deep web of lies and deceit that all comes together in the end. Well, kind of comes together. I had to think about it a little bit but it was a great concept. This book was written before 9/11 and it's amazing how Ludlum was able to forsee the futile war on terror that we deal with every day. It makes you think who's really calling the shots out there and how much are we really told about.  Is there really an agency above the NSA and CIA? 

I really liked this book. It was almost like Ludlum knew it would be his last book because he blends in some aspect from every one of his past novels to make this one a hit.
