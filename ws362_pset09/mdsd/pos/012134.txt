The Amazon.com review states that, "[i]n this greatly anticipated revised edition, Anderson updates and elaborates" his arguments first included in the 1991 edition and "revisits these fundamental ideas, showing how their relevance has been tested by the events of the past two decades."  These notes, especially the first part, seemed to imply that Anderson had edited the entire book, making changes throughout - and thus, that it might prove worthwhile to get the new release.  

But a quick trip to my local bookstore showed me otherwise: the *only new thing* in this edition is a 23-page afterword in which Anderson, indeed, "revisits" his main themes and ruminates on the book's international impact -- on that, Amazon was right.  But they also seem to suggest other changes have been made (e.g. "updates and elaborates").  I compared numerous pages in the new and old editions at the bookshop - side by side - and found *absolutely no difference* with anything in the main text.  Page numbers and even the particular words on each line correspond perfectly.  

If you're interested in owning a copy of Anderson's mini-essay on the book's success, you might want to buy the new edition.  Or, once your local town or college library gets a copy, you can drop a couple of bucks photocopying the afterword and simply slip it into your 1991 edition.  The cover art looks a bit cooler and more modern on the new release . . . but I'm not sure that's worth $20
