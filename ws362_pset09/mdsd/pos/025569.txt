I really enjoyed this book. It's winter here in Canada - time to cuddle up in front of the fireplace and read about potato farming!!! No seriously, the characters in this book are almost life like - and the way Ms. Ozeki brings them to life in these pages is great. I found this book VERY hard to put down. You will not be disappointed with this book.  I am now looking at getting her other book "My Year of Meats".
