As a pwc(person with CFIDS)I found this book to be the best yet that I have read on the everyday challenges of living with this painfully crippling disability, and how important faith in God is to help deal with the suffering. The author takes us through her experiences with CFIDS and shares her journey, and that of her also-diagnosed teen daughter. She also has included sharings from  many others affected with this illness that she has interviewed. I found the chapters on how this illness affects loved ones of the afflicted, and how others, expecially the Christian community, can help in practical ways, to be the most basic and helpful information that I have read. This is not a technical manual on CFIDS, but rather a chronical on how to cope, for both the pwc and the loved ones and community around them. The faith of the author, and of those brave souls willing to share their stories, has given me much hope in my daily living with CFIDS
