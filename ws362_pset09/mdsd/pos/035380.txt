If you've suffered, like I, through award winning books by writers who move west with their trust fund, build a mansion in the pristine wilderness and declare, by some warped sense of reality, themselves a naturalist and an expert on the west, take flight in the "The Eye of the Blackbird": Holly is a genuine western authority.

Holly has thoroughly researched the flight plan, bringing the reader along many threads on the ascent which become woven into a cohesive story of the west. Holly has mastered the art of building a solid platform and lifting the reader along with the story. This style is refreshing compared to the typical self proclaimed naturalist style of relating their view with the condescending undertone screeching; if you don't see it, you don't belong in the club.

This book is a treasure and I'm certain that Holly will eventually gain the recognition she deserves.
