This book is one of Philip K. Dick's most autobiographical, and is about the least well known time of his life.  He had just left his wife and kids in a stately house north of San Francisco to live with the junkies and vagrants of San Mateo.  The house that he lived in became well known as a place where people that were into drugs could go and always find more of what they were looking for, and usually something new as well.  Dick himself only did acid once-he preferred the more predictable effects of prescription drug abuse-and he called his experience with LSD the most terrifying 8-hours of his life.

The loss of identity that this book takes to extremes really did affect the people of Dick's house in San Mateo.  Paranoid theories ran rampant, and no one really knew who was a narc and who wasn't.  As such, it is an interesting portrait of the collective state of mind that predominated this period.

As a work of fiction, this book has a lot to say about the sources and apparatus of control in society.  The movie version does a poor job of conveying what is the central evil in the book-and in society-that Dick was trying to get to the heart of.  NewPath is an organization that purports to be the only one in society to be able to deal with the epidemic of drug abuse that 'Substance D' is ravaging on society.  They are however, the only group in society that is outside the realm of surveillence.  To quote _Enemy of the State_, "who watches the wathchers?"  That is definitely true of this book, and reflects Dick's deep distrust of the FBI/CIA.  To see how far this analogy goes, read _A Scanner Darkly_ and then ask yourself some key questions about the War on Drugs
