This was an excellent read (well, an excellent listen -- I have the audio cassette).  The book is more about the story of William Smith, the man who made the map, than about the ways the map changed the world.  Winchester repeatedly refers to the revolutions in geological and biological and thus also spiritual thought that sprang from the map and from the stratigraphic theory it embodies, but doesn't follow that thread of intellectual history forward beyond the map itself.  As a biologist, I'd have loved to hear more about those ramifications.  The Norton History of the Environmental Sciences, by Peter J. Bowler, presents much of that story.  It's drier than Winchester's highly personal and dramatic tale, but still quite readable.  

That said, I heartily enjoyed this book and will be recommending it to friends
