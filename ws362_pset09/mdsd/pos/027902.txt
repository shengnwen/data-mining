Comprehensible story of the author's foray into out of body travel, well-written and intriguing.  What he tells of the afterlife is in essence a continuation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, or, the Tibetan Book of  Living and Dying.  A good read, plus, invaluable information about what  happens after you die.  Highly recommended
