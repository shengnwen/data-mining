I was very pleased with the actual item after searching for a new NLT Bible across the web.  The cover is trendy and attractive (I bought the Brown/Camel) and the page weight is substantial enough to avoid accidental tears, but still feels "like a good Bible should".  
I am especially pleased with the Life Application study notes.  They have been helpful without being overly simplified or too complex.  I am pleased enough with this one that I just ordered my wife a copy as well!
