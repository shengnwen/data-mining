While I am a huge Steve Martini fan, I was a little concerned when I read the dust jacket blurb about this book. I'm not a big fan of military thriller style books, and from the description, it appeared that he had moved closer to that genre than to the legal mystery category. However, judging books by their covers can be very deceptive, and this proved true with this book.

This is a wonderful legal mystery with numerous twists and turns. Steve Martini provides just enough peripheral characers as to make it difficult to really figure out who did it, and why. He also keeps you hanging until the end trying to figure out how the trial will end and whether his client will go free or fry.

The characters created by Mr. Martini are fantastic, with enough detail to make them interesting and little enough detail to know them too well. I particularly liked the prosecutor, whom Mr. Martini gave the nickname of the "Death Dwarf". 

Finally, his characterizations of Harry Hinds and Paul Madriani are great. Unlike many writers of legal mysteries, his attorneys do not speak as if they came from a "silk stocking" law firm, but rather from the real world they would occupy. Harry is his usual smart mouthed self, while Mr. Madriani continues to be the calmer, and smarter of the two.

I highly recommend this book, along with the others written by Mr. Martini. I am now looking forward to my next chance to catch up with Harry, Paul and the others in his next book.
