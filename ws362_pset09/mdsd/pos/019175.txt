The Toilers of the Sea

	This is an amazingly transporting novel.  As a small child I remember having a strong fear of the ocean at night, a fear of its darkness and depth and what creatures might lie within its waters.  Victor Hugo has captured this fear and wrapped it around his novel,The Toilers of the Sea.  
        The opening half of the novel plays like a calm and reflective field journal, taking the reader across the island of Guernsey through a minutia of flora and fauna, historical lives of islanders, and detailed Channel Island geography. Before we are introduced to Hugo's cast of characters and literary intentions, he envelopes us in the islands in such a way that we grow to love their serenity; deceitful as it often is.  
    And then suddenly, without warning Deruchette and Galliat appear and a plot forms.  This second half of the novel takes on Romanticism in a way that only Victor Hugo would attempt.  All at once, man is pitted against Nature, Religion, Justice and himself.  We soon see the power of the ocean closing in around Galliat as well as the powers of those men who would have him fail.  Galliat finds himself in the darkest pit of the sea, struggling for his own survival, for the survival of what is right and what is good.  As a reader, we taste the salty air and feel the torrential wet winds that attempt to tear down poor Galliat.  We feel his every struggle and wish fervently for his success.
	Without a doubt, The Toilers of the Sea, is a wonderfully tragic novel that works on many levels.  I used to think there was no better novel than Les Miserables, no greater literary character than Jean Valjean, but now I know better-read it and see what I mean.
