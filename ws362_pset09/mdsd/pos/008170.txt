A wonderful story that defines great literature.  Ms. Little has captured real life in the 1800's with the hardships and heartaches of genuine characters.  Her use of period language and phrasing makes this a 'Steinbeck' type read.  The two women in this novel are captivating and realistic.  I can't say enough about this story.  I felt like I was there with them.  I am now going on my 7th reading
