Most training books and articles in magazines are very regimented formulas, i.e. if you are so old and have such and such goals then follow plan x. While this seems terrific for many type A endurance athletes who like to follow a very specific plan, many of us never figure out why all the hard work often only leads to stress, anxiety, fatigue, and poor results. Brad Kearns steps outside the box to explain that 1.) We are not all built the same and cannot expect that there is only one "overall perfect training plan", 2.) As humans there is a huge interdependence on mind, body and spirit which is often neglected, and 3.) We need to calm down, step back and figure out how to enjoy this sport we loved at least at one time and the results will follow.

Brad's own professional experience and his thorough knowledge of  many other top pros show the many different methods of training used, the periods of frustration experienced, and how they emerged to be even more successful. Seeing as many great relationships Brad has gained over his career and his continued positive outlook on sports and life are testaments to how he has maximized his enjoyment of the sport. His results prove how you don't have to hate your life in order to do your best.
