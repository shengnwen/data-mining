Seafood, Chicken, Beef, and more Meat!  Some of the recipies include stuffed squid heads, boiled chicken wings, Grilled stuffed grape leaves, sweet rice dumplings with ginger syrup, and fresh spring rolls!  Some of the dishes look really healthy.  It appears to contain a lot of south asian fancy food.  I am not a big fan of seafood - but those who are will probably really enjoy this book
