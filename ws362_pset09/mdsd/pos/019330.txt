I first heard of Daniel Tammet in the Discovery Times Channel program "Brainman", which he mentions in the book.  I also saw his David Letterman appearance (where he mentioned his then-very recent Asperger's diagnosis, which hadn't happened as of "Brainman"'s debut) and his profile on "60 Minutes", where I first learned that he is gay.

The book describes, from his point of view, his difficult childhood, his acceptance of his homosexuality, his conversion to Christianity (some people may have a conflict with this; he doesn't seem to and I don't either) and things in between.  He spent a year in Lithuania with a program that appeared to be a British version of the Peace Corps, and this is where he came to terms with his sexual preference and also where he really discovered his ability to learn foreign languages beyond an age where people can generally do so easily.  He certainly never could have accomplished what he has without the devotion of his parents AND the acquisition of social skills required to negotiate with eight younger siblings, one of them an "Aspie" like him.  His parents' reaction to his coming out indicated to me that, like most parents of homosexuals, they probably knew he was gay long before he did, and they were waiting for him to tell them himself.

I'm deducting one star for the some of the tedious descriptions of his lightning calculations.  Yes, I realize that's part of the story but it got tiresome to me.

Daniel, please continue to tell us your story.

Postscript:  Dawn Prince-Hughes' "Songs of the Gorilla Nation" is another fascinating story about the challenges posted by being both autistic and gay.
