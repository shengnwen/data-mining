I read this book before reading &quot;Den of Thieves&quot;.  I would really love to know what has happened to the author since publication.  I found the book very interesting even though I found the author unrepentant and heavily biased in his interpretation of actual events (read &quot;Den of Thieves&quot;).  Seems as though Levine wrote the book to mainly make amends to his wife and to convince readers of his own importance.  However, I do tend to believe Levine's descriptions of the behind-the-scenes investment world
