art since 1940 is a well researched and methodically presented book on contemorary art and art makers. the introduction and opening chapters deal with movements such as surrealism and are a very good lead up into the art  after 1940. the author has dealt with various movements and expanded on  specific artists from each of these phases in art. one does feel however  that the portions on certain artists were sketchier than others, especially  with regards to the visual material provided. also the book could have been  planned better in terms of the placement of photographs along with the  corresponding text. All in all, however, as an art student, I thoroughly  recommend this book to anyone who ever wondered what all that 'thrown about  paint'in jackson pollock's work was all about. The life history of the  artists was well researched and wasnt superficial like a lot of books on  art and provided a valuable insight into the art work itself
