Allison Brennan is a writer I found quite by accident but it was one of the best accidental finds I have ever made. This 2nd book in her trilogy is wonderful. It keeps you guessing until the end while the suspence builds nonstop. It blends an enthralling tale of obsession, mystery, suspence, and romance perfectly. A+++++++++++
