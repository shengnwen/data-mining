     Moody is critical enough about what is going on that he makes a good investigator into the NDE phenomenon. There are too many flakes in the field and too many people aiming to crown themselves as spiritual gurus via their claim of having revelations during an NDE. Moody quite simply surveys people who have this experience and notes their similarities and differences. Then, he tries to put it into perspective - how might it be explained physically, psychologically, spiritually? What other phenomenon produce experiences that overlap with some of the ones reported in NDEs (e.g. high-gravity simulators)?

     What I like most is that he just lays down the evidence without trying to overextend himself by speculating on what is really going on. The book is relatively short, but well-written and will keep your attention. I felt it fell a bit short of 5 starts for two reasons. First, he neglects to mention at all the negative NDEs or "Fear Death Experiences". How common the FDEs are is the subject of debate, but he does not even touch the topic. Second, it's really just a brief mention, but he cites the Bridey Murphy reincarnation study as if it were believable - but it was discredited a long time ago (1950's?), so I'm dissapointed he apparently either didn't know that or wasn't skeptical enough to follow that through prior to putting it in print.

    Other than minor problems, though, this is really a very interesting book
