It was said that at the height of the Mongol empire a virgin with a hundred pounds of gold could travel from one end of the empire to the other with no fear of losing anything. That was, however, after the conquering phase. 

While a country was being conquered it was pretty rough. The standard rule was to approach a city, if the city surrendered all was fine. Any resistance at all and everyone in the city was killed. This tended to make the next city surrender. 

By any measure, Genghis Kahn was one of the great military leaders of all time. The empire he conquered stretched from the shores of the pacific to the very gates of Europe. His exploits are less well known than others because of his Eastern origin, yet his empire was twice (or more) the size of that conquered by Alexander.
