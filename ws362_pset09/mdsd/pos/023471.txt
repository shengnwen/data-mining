I remember the '82 Boston marathon well, and was thrilled to discover this book.  The story of the race between Alberto Salazar and Dick Beardsley is fascinating, and for the most part it is well told here.  However, the book could have used a little more refinement before publication.  It is repetitious at points and lacks detail at many others.  For example, the author includes a chapter on Salazar's comeback victory in the '94 Comrades ultramarathon, which is an amazing story in its own right.  However, that chapter is a mere five pages long, including the large font first page, with several italicized sections surrounded by white space.  That's pretty skimpy.  

As much as I enjoyed reading about the race, I was often frustrated at wanting to know more detail than the author provided.  If the story itself wasn't so compelling, I'd give this book three stars -- not because what was published isn't good reading, but because there's so much more that could have been done to tell the story more fully.
