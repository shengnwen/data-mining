This book is ok for a trader that needs to start from scratch. But you will be needing more specific trading strategies.

Keep in mind that the stock market doesn't really care if you are beginner. The rules and the trading opportunities are the same for every one. When you trade you compete against more seasoned traders, therefore you MUST go beyond the basics and employ a clear strategy to make your buy and sell decisions. 

There are many "fantastic" strategies outhere, but you need to test them in order to discover which ones help you the most. That's part of your homework as a stocktrader. Test, test and test again. 

Complicated systems that rely on a "boat load" of technical indicators can make you slow, and being slow in this game can be as dangerous as not knowing what to do in the first place. 

I think the worst thing that can happen to a beginner trader is to get information overload. It's better to go step by step, and test a simple strategy that can show you how to focus on concrete ways to make money. 

Fortunatly there are some good sites on the web today that can show you how to trade in a practical and effective way. One of those sites is Stress Free Traders ( StressFreeTraders com) 

In the end, day trading is all about buying and selling according to your knowledge FILTER. Once you master and follow your proven filter parameters like a clock, you can expect to start making serious amounts of cash on a consistent basis
