Gully Foyle is no ordinary man.  Gully Foyle is a nothing.  Abandoned on a wrecked spaceship to die.  But Gully Foyle is not ready to die; he manages to escape his wrought prison and proceeds to embark on an adventure that will not only change how he looks at himself and the world, but how the world looks at him.

The Stars My Destination was a surprise.  Published in the mid-1950's, the book felt like it was written (with only a few exceptions here and there) within the past decade.  It is truly amazing how correct Alfred Bester was about a whole host of technological issues; everything from computer-controlled defense systems to how people and objects react in a microgravity/zero-g environment Bester pretty much hit the nail on the head.  And to top it all off, there is a genuine, character-driven and character-building story behind it all.  The only criticism I have to offer is that I wish the crux of the story got moving a bit earlier on than it did.  On whole, I highly recommend this book.  The Stars My Destination is like no other book I've ever read from this period in science fiction.
