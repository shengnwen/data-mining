I am a member of Blue and Gray Educational Society.  I have been waiting for over a year for this book to come out.  For those of us that have been in the field with "the grand old man," Ed Bearss, the book will take you there.  You can hear the gruff old voice as he walks back and forth on "the lovely ground."  I spent 4 years touring every field of the Ed Bearss Essential Civil War tours. This book is a must read!  From the wooded hills at Little Round Top where the echoes of the guns of the 20th Maine can still be heard (for those with ears to hear) to the rolling ground of Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg, Mr. Bearss will make it come alive again. There is a sense of romantic involvement here...but there is nitty gritty history as well.  Our group had descendents of both the Federal and Confederate fighting men. At Chancelorsville, a fellow physician and I debated the historical effect of "Fighting Joe Hooker's" likely head injury that cost the Army of the Potomac the field (and the victory that was clearly in their grasp).  At Vicksburg, we climbed the sweaty way up to the top of what is left of Champion Hill (where we found a tattered Confederate flag hanging from a makeshift pole)and we "saw" with Ed the view across to what was "fortress Vicksburg" some 20 miles away.  We had professional and amature historians on our tours, we had descendents of veterans tracing their ancestors histories, we had producers of the films Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, and more than anything else, we had Americans in search of their heritage.  This book is a compendium of the verbatim interpretations of the battles made by the historian emeritus of the National Park Service himself.  

As for the mud:  ask Charlotte from Cape Cod about the mud in Antietam...we were hip deep and loving it.

Get the book.  Read it.  If you are a historian of the Civil War, for heaven's sake, get into the field with Ed Bearss while you still can.  You won't regret a minute of it.
