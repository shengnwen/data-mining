This is a good intoductory book on Digital Circuits and VLSI design. Apart from having a few jumps here and there, the book is definitely readable. I would recommend this book to you if this is your first course on digital circuits. However if you are really serious about this subject, you can read Principles of CMOS VLSI Design by Neil Weste and Kamran Eshraghain or Digital Integrated Circuits by Anantha Chandrakasan & Borivoje Nikolic. This book is definitely not for advanced readers
