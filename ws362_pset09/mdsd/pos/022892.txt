Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (Pulitzer Prize winning  author of The Yearling) moves into a cabin in Cross Creek and tells of her life in this tiny community in central Florida around the 1930's.
She makes the change from life in a big city to a life that is simple and yet demanding, quiet yet  open to all and full of new,unimagined challenges and conquests.
She uses language of the time. While it would not be considered politically correct,  the  language does bring the realities of life in  rustic Cross Creek into a clearer more tangible experience, abundantly filled  with the feel, the taste,  and the scents of life in the backcountry.
Her education in the flora and fauna, her tribulations with hired hands, her understanding of those around her are all so vividly told that you feel as if you could have been there watching it all take place before your very eyes.
The insight into the mind and heart of Marjorie Rawlings was both intimate and  detached at times.  Sometimes she was a delicate piece of the "machinery" driving this backcountry haven and at other times she seemed to feel as if she were but an observer, an outsider, merely watching from a well placed vantage point.  This is an intriguing look into the life, the heart and the soul of this beloved classic author
