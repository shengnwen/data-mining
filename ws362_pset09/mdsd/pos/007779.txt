We've been living in a new city searching for a church where we could invite any of our friends, regardless of their background, life situation, and past church experience (or lack of), without fear of putting them in an uncomfortable situation.  A much larger order to fill than we had expected, because, as it turns out, many people are NOT comfortable in church--period!  This book explains how that has come to be and why churches are struggling, but, most importantly, it demonstrates exactly how churches and ALL Christians can (and should) reach out to and meet the needs of an ultra-diverse population with diverse backgrounds, lifestyles and situations.  This is NOT "watered-down Christianity" or "moral relativism"--contrarily, it is biblical Christianity in its best, purest, most powerful and effective (and user-friendly) form.  For ANYONE interested in effectively reaching the seemingly unreachable.  The author is incredibly engaging and easy to read, but be warned that the substance might just change your perspective on church and religion!
