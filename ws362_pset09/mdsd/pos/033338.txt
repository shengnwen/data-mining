Georgette Heyer officianados will want this book. I'm talking about those of us who have a complete list of all her titles and notes about the ones we liked. There isn't much bio on this exceptionally private author, and this effort focuses on a history of critical reviews of Heyer's work. But, it also contains several unavailable shorts published in the 1920s, as well as excerpts from the out-of-print 1998 biography of Heyer by Jane Aiken Hodge, and a 1996 print interview with Heyer's son, Sir Richard Rougier, that are worth the price in themselves. Highly recommended
