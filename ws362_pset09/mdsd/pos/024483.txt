Yes. That pretty much sums it up. This book broke the trail for strategic chess writing, and as you can see from other reviews, there are some outright mistakes in it. But, like the classical view of the atom, it's *how* you learn to progress to the more correct, modern view of strategic chess. Sometimes you need to see how wrong an idea is to see how right another idea can be.

This is a good first read for novice/intermediate players on Strategy, then Pachmans' books, then the Watson book, in that order.
