a few great artists/illustrators (pelaez, arantza, danilo, sosa, and caruso) and a whole lot of amatuerish junk - pelaez and arantza have drawings that once again show them to be the masters of the pencil and the female figure - the few drawings they have here are well worth the cost of the book by themselves, otherwise i would have rated this book 1 star

arantza and pelaez, and to some extent the other illustrators i mentioned, can produce erotic art that is beautiful without being raunchy - however the rest of the art in this book is erotic art at its worst, poorly drawn and composed, raunchy instead of beautiful, overused cliched poses, models that look like hookers, and worst of all skin textures and outlines that make the figures look hard and rough

if you like that sort of rough junky porn looking art then you will like this book - otherwise i would suggest just buying art books by arantza and pelaez - but this book is so cheap it really is worth buying for the dozen pics that are superb
