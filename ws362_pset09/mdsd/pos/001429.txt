This book is part of the G. I. series of short illustrated studies covering a period or a series of campaigns. All of these books are vertical studies covering a period of years. Though sometimes the illustrations  serve to identify individual items of equipment, these works are not  intended for that purpose. They are not catalogs intended for materiel  collectors. They are of such a length and of such a level of detail that  they will serve the purposes of the general reader with a curiousity about  what grandaddy did in WW II or great great great grandaddy in the Civil War  and what he looked like and how he lived. This is not to say that the  specialist such as myself cannot find useful nuggets herein. I can. I use  these for general surveys of periods I do not study in detail, such as the  Civil War, and the War With Mexico, etc. And to look up the odd facts. I  have yet to be disappointed with any of them
