This is one of the most amazing young adult novels I've ever read, and I sincerely hope that it becomes a classic one day.  It's about a very imaginative kid named Kit and his adventures in an old mining town called Stoneygate.  After his grandfather tells him stories of the history of the mines, Kit begins to "see" children from the past who died in the pit.  Are the ghosts real?  It's never really clear, just as the ghosts themselves are not clear, flickering at the edges of Kit's vision. It ultimatley doesn't matter.  This is not a ghost story, but a story of how certain places can hold atomospheres from the past, in this case the old mines.  Almond uses magical realism to make this very convincing.  The images of the ancient children in the pit are not too detailed, challenging the reader's imagination to supply the details. 
 

The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is because the writing isn't as accessilbe as, for example, Harry Potter.  This book isn't for everyone.  Only kids who can appreciate the imagery and subtleness will want to read it.  They are the lucky ones.
