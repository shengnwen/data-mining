This is the first book that I have read of the Brother Cadfael Mysteries.  I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I was drawn into the world of medieval England that Peters brings to life.  "The Raven in the Foregate" is a quick read, entertaining and mysterious to the fact that there is not much mystery to the case at hand.

As usual, Brother Cadfael is drawn into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of the newly instituted priest of Holy Cross, Father Ailnoth.  While he was alive, Ailnoth was quick to make enemies in the church and in the community; many are glad to see him dead, and many are content to hold their tongues as to the truth of what caused his death on Christmas Eve.  Complicating matters are the search for a French renegade who was undercover at Holy Cross in the guise of the nephew of Father Ailnoth's housekeeper.  Brother Cadfael must piece together the scant clues and abounding rumors to uncover the truth of Ailnoth's death.

"The Raven in the Foregate" is a well-written mystery, although at times too tidy and predictable.  It was a true delight to enter into the world of Holy Cross and medieval England that Peters has crafted throughout her Cadfael mystery series.   I look forward to reading the other books in the series.
