Goodness! Reading this book, I can't help but wonder how we've gotten along without it for so long, or for as long as hysteria as a working clinical-theoretical construct has been banished from our vernacular.  Bollas depicts with great creativity and clarity just what hysteria is, and gives us a working sense of how to differentiate it from other psychic structures, especially the borderline, with which it has most commonly been misunderstood.  True to classical and object relations thinking, the author also extends our understanding of this most complex patient.  His differential descriptions of various structures is done through not only what the patient struggles with, but also how both the transference and the countertransference vary.  A must-read! for any psychotherapist serious about working the depths of our patients
