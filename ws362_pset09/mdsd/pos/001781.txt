Although Rick Moody asserts on the dust jacket that "this book does not need a blurb", but I think it does. It's a memoir of a most unusual kind, in it Eggers dares readers with both subject and style in a way that may turn off some readers with at least one or two of his attempts. The book is about how he and his three siblings lost both parents to cancer within weeks of each other. The 21 year-old ends up as father AND mother to his 8 year-old brother Toph.

Eggers description of his mother's death is only the first of many efforts to reconcile himself to loss, and the book is immensely moving on this level. In conversations with a couple friends who also read this book, I found that we all have parts that hit us forcefully and others we felt were weak. Some find the 40-page preface self-conscious, but I found it brilliant. For me, the middle section about the author's work on "Might" magazine sort of flops, but one friend liked that the best, so go figure.

Eggers ends his story with a powerfully felt, and powerfully described, return home. His exuberant style seems to be a manifestation of his own unwaivering hunger for life...a defiant response to death.

I look forward to reading more of Eggers work in the future. This was an incredibly engaging and moving book. I'm not sure it lives up to the title, but it comes very darn close.
