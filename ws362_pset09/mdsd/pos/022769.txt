H.L. Nigro is one of a handful of scholars who have independently discovered that the Bible teaches a PreWrath, PreMillennial Rapture.  My favorite section of this book is the Q&A at the very front.  There the author addresses the questions that someone coming from a PreTrib viewpoint is likely to have when first encountering the PreWrath view.

Throughout the course of the text, H.L. examines the Word of God faithfully and thoroughly to determine the true intent of the Author.  For any who want to go deeper into the differences between PreTrib and PreWrath, the author provides an appendix that examines "Maranatha!  Our Lord Come!" by Renald Showers and also an appendix that takes issue with "The Rapture Question Answered" by John Walvoord.  The PreTrib stance is given a fair hearing by this charitable author, who is clearly walking close to the Lord.  

Whether you have studied End Times prophecy a little or a lot, you will be blessed by considering H.L. Nigro's well-reasoned arguments in favor of the PreWrath view.  You will, at the least, see an example of how to debate a controversial issue without becoming obnoxious.  At the most, you will discover the truth
