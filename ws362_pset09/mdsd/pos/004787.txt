Garwood (a great example of writing touching romances) has easily broken though to writing contemporary romantic suspence.  She has succeeded beyond my own hopes with this book first published in 2000.  Why did I wait five years to get this book?  I was very sceptical and I'm quite a picky reader, but this read was superb and even though I'm not the first to say "Job well done" I concur with other readers that this was a great joy to read and it's a shame it ended so soon (even with 520 pages!)  

By the by, on a quick side note, one of the characters -- a charmer by the name of Noah Clayborne -- ought to have his own book.  Plus, I wonder if I'm reading too much into his last name, but could he be the descendant of the ficticious Clayborne family from her other books "Come the Spring" the Rose Trilogy and "For the Roses"?  Just a though really, but I like to think that she was making a point to let her readers know of that detail...

Refreshing dialogue between all of the characters breaks up the depressing monotony of death and crime that usually weighs a mystery book down.  My favorite characters (besides our primary ones, of course) were the Vanderman sisters.  Hil-ar-i-ous!!! Anyway, this book was refreshing and lightened occasionly when needed.  The author has great timing and paced the novel well.  

My Rating: 5 solid stars for a breakthrough performance.

My Recommendations: White Hot by Sandra Brown, 1st to Die by Patterson
