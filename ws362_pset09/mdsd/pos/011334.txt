Not as good as her first book but has some good advise on cortisol control a real issue with both men and women. Especially women starting or going through menopause. I have been a Pharmacist for 30 years. I have seen many diets come and go, and Suzanne recommendation are was I teach my customers every day. Well worth buying. I have purchased 20 book to lend out to my customers so they can learn about themselves
