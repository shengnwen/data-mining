I would definitely recommend this book if what you're looking for is a concise and informative guide to a wide array of techniques for shooting close ups with your D-SLR, your digicam, or even your scanner (the scanner chapter was particularly inspiring).  Mr. Meehan's prose is a bit labored, but he does exactly what I was hoping he would do: he gives examples of different close up photos you might want to take (flowers or insects outside, jewelry in artificial light, model cars with a dedicated macro flash system, ETC.), and then gives a concise run-down of what you need to do and possibly purchase in order to make similar shots.  

My only criticism of this book is that it contains an almost unbelievable number of typos, nearly one every three pages, as well as at least one totally incorrect image (an image of what is supposed to be a camera with a bellows extender attached actually shows something completely different).  Still, if you can get past all the typos, it's a good basic primer in digital close up techniques, with a few ideas you may not even have thought to try.
