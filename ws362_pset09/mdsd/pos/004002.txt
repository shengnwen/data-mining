     Gail Griffith's account of her son's illness comes across as painfully honest. Her inclusion of her son's and Megan's writings was very helpful for those of us who seek to understand the crippling illness called clinical depression. If you have ever had to deal with a close relative who is suffering from clinical depression, this account clearly lays out the anguish being experienced by the sufferer and also by the immediate family dealing with this person. Because the author deals with many of the difficulties and controversies (medical, pharmacological, and financial) encountered in trying to find a viable treatment program, much helpful information is offered. The book is also very informative about the present state-of-the art in dealing with clinical depression.
     Above all, I found this book to be a fascinating, well-written and gripping account that was very much worth reading. Thank you, Gail
