As an avid reader, I find that an increasing number of the books I read simply re-hash old, familiar ideas.  I read this book in preparation for a Church retreat, and was expecting a typical, look-at-your-priorities to prioritize-your-activites type of book - time management with a spiritual slant.  What I found was much deeper than that.
The book proposes a fundamental shift in our psychology of approaching time; changing our entire attitude to one of gratitude, reverence, an attunement to natural (divine) rhythms.  But don't think it's all abstract philosophy - the book is every bit as practical as it is philosophical.  I don't know that I'd go as far as to call it life-changing...  But it's definitely nudging me in a whole new mental direction.
Highly recommended for the (like me) hassled and harried
