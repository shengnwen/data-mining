This second book from scott robertson is just as amazing as his "lift off" book. This book has real world examples of the creative process that it takes to create a vehicle from a simple idea to a final render. Tons of amazing sketches are inspirational and just candy for your eyes. I love this book and never get tired off looking at it. I recomend it to anyone in the design field who is looking for fresh ideas and work for inspiratio
