This is my favorite short story of all time.  Yes, it's a little twisted, but that's Poe for you.  Poe makes excellent use of irony, foreshadowing, and sensory devices in "Cask of Amontillado," making it excellent fodder for a literary analysis essay.  The vocabulary is a little dated, and you may need a dictionary if you don't remember what "immolation" means, but let's face it, kids, this is eighth or ninth grade reading here.  You and ask.oxford.com can handle this little story
