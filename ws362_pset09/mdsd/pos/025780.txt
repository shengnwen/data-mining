This is the fourth Edith Wharton book I have read.  I read it a couple of months after reading The House of Mirth, and The Custom of the Country actually makes a great companion piece to it.  

Custom of the Country is hard to love.  We loathe the selfishness of its main character, Undine Spragg, who always gets her way even if it ruins her parents or husband.  We marvel at her self-centeredness and her lack of awareness of what she is doing to others.  And she doesn't even have the spirit that a similar character, Scarlett O'Hara, has--something that make us root for Scarlett despite her character.

On the other hand, the House of Mirth is easy to love.  Its protagonist, Lily Bart, cries out for our sympathy and love.  She realizes she is caught by unfair societal requirements and wants to break free of them.  She is unable to do so, and it causes tragedy.  

But both Undine and Lily are caught in the same web.  They both cannot be truly happy because they cannot see a way out of their upbringing.  The main difference is that Lily is aware of her problem and Undine is not.  

But we should have sympathy for Undine, and we should judge Lily more harshly.  Shouldn't Lily, being aware that making her way in society is not a way to happiness, figure a way to break through of society's rules?  Shouldn't we feel sorry for Undine who never figures out that social climbing will not make her truly happy?

It is Wharton's genius to show us the flip-sides of how American aristocratic society harmed its great society ladies in these two richly written, beautiful books.  Everyone who has read and loved The House of Mirth should read this book
