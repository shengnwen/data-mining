DK has a great formula for introducing topics to kids. Beautiful graphics, excellent layout and good summaries of important facts surrounding their topics.

Such is the same for their Civil War book.  For the child wanting (or needing) an introduction to the Civil War this book will serve well.  The pictures draw the attention of the browser and the text gives a pretty good brief summary of the why, who and what for the reader.

An excellent addition for your child's library
