MftN is a good book for those individuals who enjoy math and science, but who are not necessarily devoted to its study.  I enjoyed the historical background and practical applications in math brought out by Kline (e.g., measuring the dimensions of the Earth).

Kline says that his book is intended for those liberal arts students who are not drawn to math.  He tries to give those individuals the background and practical perspectives that will keep them interested.  I believe he accomplishes this.  I also believe that this type of story-teaching regarding mathematics could be useful for the science student as well.

Overall, the book is a very good read and one I highly recommend as long as you have the perserverance and desire to expand your knowledge of mathematics.  If not, don't bother starting this book
