"Cathedral" was actually the first time I read a collection of Carver stories. I'd heard his name alot but don't read short stories much. Great realist storytelling about working class people facing changes/crisis/alterations in life. It made me think of my 70's childhood and the adults around me then(since I think the stories were from that period). I also recognized one of the stories from Altman's "Short Cuts" movie. I plan to read more Raymond Carver
