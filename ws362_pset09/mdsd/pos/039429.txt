My son and I don't get the chance to read together as often as we did when he was younger. He is now 9 and likes to read on his own, and I have younger ones to tend to also. But when we do read together, it is really special and this one was a favorite. It is the second in the series (first is Journey to the Mushroom Planet, I think). We loved them both. Very creative and some suspense. Long descriptions and some more complex words make it ideal for a parent to read aloud, unless the child is older and a truly avid reader. We will try the third book, though we've heard the first two are the best. Definitely read the first two
