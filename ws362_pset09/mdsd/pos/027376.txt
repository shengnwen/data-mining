Reaper Man is a simple book.  It's about Death.  And it's pure genius.

Terry Pratchett is now my favorite author of all time.  The fact is that there are 26 books in the Discworld series, many of which I have no desire to read.  But the ones he writes that tickle my fancy are simply amazing.

Reaper Man is a novel with a few different storylines.  The chief one concerns Death, who has given up his day job.  Others include wizards, the ideology of life, a confused zombie, and a supernatural fun club.

Pratchett's sense of humor is extraordinary.  Some reviewers compare him to Monty Python or (insert generic British humor reference here).  But comparing him to someone is like comparing Dave Barry, or Hemingway, or heck, even JK Rowling.  They stand beyond comparison, as they're all fairly unique in their perspective, and because nobody does what they do better.

Pratchett is a satirist, loosely, and his works contain terrific characters and excellent descriptions of scene.  His writing is exceptional - the introductions to every novel in his series would win him a Pulitzer if he ever published them all.  And his stories have lovely beginnings, middles, and ends.

I cannot recommend this book highly enough, as it is my favorite of the series.  It was, in the end, not just a humor book, but one so touching that I literally almost cried.

The only drawback to this whole series is that you HAVE to start with the first two books in the series, and they're good, but not at the level of his later works.  No matter.  Treat yourself to this book, and if it doesn't become one of your favorites, then blame me.  =
