This comic has it all:the zany poetry of Peanuts,the wry criticism on human fallacies of Doonesbury,and the philosophy of Calvin and Hobbes,plus a scent of the best Pogo.Phoney Bone is the real negative hero of this book:his manipulation of the brainless masses superb,his total lack of  scruples joined whit a nietzcheian rationalization (&quot;People like to be  victims! There's a sort of moral superiority attached to  it...)unparalleled.If he fails,it is only for the spirit of sacrifice of  the Dragon,a real Christian image,I dare say.Phoney Bone is a veritable  Stavrogin of comics
