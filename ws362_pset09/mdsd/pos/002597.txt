A friend and I met Patricia a few months ago in the tasting room of Bonny Doone Winery.  She was an enchanting woman, and we feel for her immediately.  The cookbooks she writes are an extension of the fine skills  and great heart she posesses.  Bravo to wonderful food, good wine and great  company!   Thank you Patti for great ideas on cooking with wine
