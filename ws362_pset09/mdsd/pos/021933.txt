I wanted to read this book in order to know some of the history in the conquest of america in the early years. Despite that perhaps some of the atrocities where not commited with that violence and some never happened, I think most of them are true. All this violence in the name of gold and the Inquisition. 

Now, for the people who came to America, it was not an easy task. Far away from home, most of the people uneducated and indians that you cannot trust completly, the death of people was something inevitable but resulted in massacre. 

A dark episode in the History of Spain and America. Finally, you realized that other colonizations were not that violent and more prosperous, it was just the "fortune" of America to receive these spaniards
