This commentary on Acts offers a great deal of historical background on the people, places, and events of the 1st century Christian church.  In some places it gets a little bogged down with the names of all the people, but quite often Bruce offers interesting insights into the climate of the times.  Taking the time to slow down and review some of the accounts in Acts really opens your eyes to details that are easily missed, or left out in the translation.  There could have been more discussion of theological issues in the commentary, but Bruce seemed to be content in describing historical aspects. The commentary did convey a respect for the book of Acts as the Word of God, and would be a good place for a reader to get some additional insight into Acts
