Intrigued by the title of Kemp's book, I purchased a copy for myself and a few colleagues after a particularly hectic work week.  To be honest, I was not sure if there would be any value in reading a book about how to say "no."  To my surprise the book was as much about saying "yes" as saying "no."  Its value is in helping you learn about yourself, your values, and situations such that you recognize when saying "yes" and when saying "no" makes sense for you.

The book includes situational stories and questions that help you contextualize the concepts presented.  There are hundreds of examples of how to say "no" for those who sometimes are at a loss for how to do so. Each chapter has a theme and suggestions that build on each other through the book.

I think most who read this book will find the message and its delivery worth it.  I certainly did.  After reading this book you will have a better understanding of when, why, and how you will want to say "no.
