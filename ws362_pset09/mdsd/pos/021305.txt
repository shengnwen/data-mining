If you HAVE to read this book, you'll know what I mean.  The first time I read this book, I hated it... Boring, and one reviewer is right, it covers EVERYTHING under the sun about S/E.  Now, after about two years or so, I keep finding myself refering to this book over and over again.  I am liking more now that I see how and where to use the topics that it talks about.  4 star, b/c this book could have been written better.  First time around was very boring
