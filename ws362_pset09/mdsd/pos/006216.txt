This is a great book to learn about the culture, history and traditions of a Geechee community on Sapelo Island, GA.  Compared to other books I have read about this area, Ms. Bailey really focuses on the folklore and superstitions that shaped life on this isolated island during the second half of the 20th century.  Although some of these traditions continue, many are fading away as this unique community shrinks in size.  Ms. Bailey considers it her duty to be a storyteller, to pass these stories down to whoever will listen, and to keep the traditions alive.  Ms. Bailey succeeds by telling her story with a vibrant narrative - a very fast and rewarding read
