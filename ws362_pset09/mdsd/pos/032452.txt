I cannot stress enough how much this book has helped me with the grieving  process.  It is absolutely wonderful.  So compassionate, caring and  helpful.  The author really captured my heart and addressed my feelings so  directly. I couldn't put A Time To Grieve down and have since passed this  most treasured book on to several coworkers.  One of them lost her husband  and  reads it each night.  She said it is the first time in three years  that she is able to sleep through the night
