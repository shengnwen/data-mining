Finally Dr. Farmer couples his lucid historical, political and economic analyses of the conditions that put the poor at risk for bad health outcomes, with a plainly indignant calling out of healthcare professionals  and healthcare organizations to make honest efforts to understand and  remedy conditions which would never be tolerated among the well off in  Western nations.  In his goundbreaking, earlier books, &quot;AIDS and  Accusations,&quot; and &quot;The Uses of Haiti,&quot; Dr. Farmer matter of  factly discusses the global and local structural conditions and  misrepresentations which led to the spread of disease and persistent,  dismal health conditions in Haiti.   In &quot;Infections and  Inequality,&quot; Dr. Farmer adds moral overtones to incisive,  sociopolitical analysis and his characteristic accounts of individuals  suffering from disease.  The book consequently provides a powerful  reflection from a man who has worked in some of the world's poorest regions  on what the benefits of medical technology mean for people who have not  traditionally had access to them.  A powerful, informative read that  clearly reflects the years of experience of a physician who has wrestled  with the global responsibility of caring for the those who are worst off.   An obligatory read for anyone even thinking of working for the impoverished  of the world
