The death scenes in this one was more graphic than the first.  Jean-Claude scenes were limited.  Anita actually admitted she lusted after him.  So that mixes in just enough tension between the two.  They argue about her not acting like a human servant and how she just wants to be left alone.  She threatens to kill Jean-Claude if he forces anything else on her.  He always seems to be surprised during these conversations.  I found the vandun priestess a very interesting character.  She shed a nice light to the bad/good side of the practice.  I still love the sarcastic humor and the human side of Anita.  She needs to constantly remind herself that she's a tough-as-nails vampire hunter but still has heart enough to cry at a murder scene.  It makes her character more believable that she would toss her cookies during the investigations.  

Murder, mystery, a slight bit of romance.  Another great story.  I'm glad there's more of Anita past in this novel.  You get to find out some stuff about her roots
