I LOVED this book! It was my second attempt at it though . . .the first one was derailed by family crises of the most common kind . . . and I am so glad that I went back to it. I shan't repeat much of the plot but would like to say that Franzen's command of the english language, of twisting plotlines and of touching unerringly on the heart of the matter is absolutely stunning.
The disintegration of Alfred's mind due to Parkinson's, the self centered misery of Chip's life, the utter meanness of the family relationships Gary endures and, in all that, the floundering Enid are events and characters that come alive for the reader. I did not find this a dark book. Cuttingly honest perhaps but not dark with misery in the way that some authors like to be. If you enjoyed Middlesex or Life of Pi you will enjoy this book
