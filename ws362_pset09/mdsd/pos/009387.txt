Talk about a wake-up call.  I'm 30 years-old and feel like this book taught me more about relationships (men vs. women mentality) in 1 hour than I've learned in all that time.  While reading it, you will have light-bulb after light-bulb type moments. Heck, you may even smack yourself square in the forehead with a resounding, "D'oh!"  John Gray knows men and he knows women, and the biggest lesson he contiues to teach is that we are NOT the same.  We do NOT think the same.  This book does a fantastic job of not only explaining that, but also giving us advice on how we go about having a successful relationship in spite of our differences.  A must read.  For women...AND men!
