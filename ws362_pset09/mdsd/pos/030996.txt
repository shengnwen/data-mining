Okay, I went into this book after seeing the remake of Haunting of House Hill. I've never seen the original and can only pray that it does more justice to the book.

It's a short and easy read, but interesting. The characters don't seem too developed, but it is a ghost story, and I think it does it's job at being creepy. 

I've read The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, and plan on getting more of her stuff
