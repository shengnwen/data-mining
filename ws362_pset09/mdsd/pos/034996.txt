And this collection of his short stories just proves it once again. This is a fabulous addition to anyone Neil Gaiman collection, or even just to your general fiction/myths collection. 

Neil has gathered in this book many wonderful and thought-provoking original stories, as well as some delightfully refreshing revamps of classic fairy tales. 

The book over-all does have a bit of a dark side, but for me that is refreshing from all the short story collections I've seen that are all happy and bright. Neil's masterful stories really got me hooked. I finished the whole book in a night and then immediately went back and reread it... several times. 

This is a book that will get worn out very quickly.
