My little one loves the Berenstain Bears so when I saw this one, I grabbed it through a book club.  It talks about how the cubs always want to get out of doing their chores, as well as Papa bear (he doesn't want to mow the lawn because a mama spider just got finished making a web on his lawnmower!) and they make up all sorts of excuses as to why they cannot do them.  So for awhile, Mama decides that instead of hearing all the bickering, arguing and excuse making, that it would just be easier if she did them herself.  However, she eventually gives in to her family when they ask to stop doing chores.  Mama starts her gardening and quilting clubs again and the treehouse falls into a total mess.  Even a milipede comes chasing Sister in the bathtub, there's dust and doggie doo-doo everywhere, wet, moldy towels and shower curtains, and a sink full of dishes covered in flies!  Yuck!

This book gives a great example of what happens when folks don't want to do their chores around the house.  It very clearly paints a vivid picture of how important all of our responsibilities are both to the things we own and to each other as family members.  As always, the Berenstains teach a very valuble lesson.  (This book is also particularly great to hand over to all the dads to read!)  Highly recommend
