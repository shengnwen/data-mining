Not as personally powerful to me as Memory &amp; Dream, but DeLint again here does wonderfuls things with urban fantasy. He draws heavily on Native American beliefs, which is something I'd like to see more of in modern fantasy. His characters are great and well drawn, and Newford becomes more a place I want to visit every time I read about it
