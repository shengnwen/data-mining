This is undoubtedly the strangest book I've read in a long time.

I got Wigfield from the library because I love Stephen Colbert - his current show, of course, is amazing, but what I've seen of Strangers With Candy is perhaps even better. Naturally, a book written by the three talented people behind such a show sounded promising.

In addition to being funny in a I-really-shouldn't-be-laughing-at-stuff-like-this way, there's also brilliant wordplay and the like, which make it even more fun to read.

Not for the faint of heart, but definitely for those who enjoy somewhat reckless, completely politically incorrect (and I hate to use that phrase, because it's tossed about so much nowadays to refer to just about anything), and overall rather bizarre humor. Much like Strangers with Candy.

Great book.
It's kind of brilliant and terrible at the same time.
I'll have to read it again
