An invaluable, descriptive price guide on LPs.  My #1 overall favorite!  Very good for Jazz, rock and punk (obscure artists &amp; bands). Provides three (3) prices based on condition as well. Much more definitive than Osborne's record guides but prices are not as &quot;realistic&quot; (averaged) as Jerry's.  Only flaw is that Import and Bootleg LP information is VERY sparse - especially on Beatles, Hendrix, Jazz, and punk.  Value of Beatles Vee-Jay &quot;counterfeit's&quot; should also be listed as some are not that terrible sounding. A truly great overall LP guide for most needs. Now if I could only find the same type of excellent price guide for Reel-to-Reel tapes.......
