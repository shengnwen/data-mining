A must read for any designer that cares about the environment. A new way of thinking about our consumer culture. McDonough is on the leading edge of "green design". The book is a good mix of science and design, but don't expect glamorous photos of architecture. This book has become a good conversation starter in our office as there are no concrete answers, mostly concepts. A major plus is that you can read it in the bath as its made of truly recyclable waterproof paper.
