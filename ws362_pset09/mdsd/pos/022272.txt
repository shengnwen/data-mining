I received this book as a gift at Christmas, and I thought it was great!  I will grant that I do still have questions regarding my first pregnancy, but I did find this book quite helpful.  As for the complaint that the book is too religious?  Well, I enjoy reading a book that takes my religious and ethical viewpoints to heart.  Whether you are a Christian Mom-to-be or not, this book is a fantastic read.  Very funny and enjoyable.  Full of practical advice and humourous anecdotes.  I can't wait to read Lorilee's new book about baby's first year
