Like most of the other reviewers, I have been a Heinlein fan for much of my life and a Spider fan for the last couple of decades--those time frames are not the same, btw.

I started this book with some trepidation. After all, how can someone copy the Master? Answer: she can't. But...Spider will be the first to admit he was not trying to copy Heinlein's style. He knows better than that.

I did have some cognitive dissonance in the beginning. Here was obviously a Heinlein plot but with Spider's puns and 4 letter words. I almost felt schitzophrenic looking for what was RAH's and what was Spider's. About half-way through, I just gave up and enjoyed the ride. I still got a kick out of the references to the the Future History (especially at the end) and to Spider's "classical" (i.e. contemporary) ones. It makes perfect sense to me that the current "War on Terror" could lead to the rise of a Nehamiah Scudder. I think Heinlein is spinning in his figurative grave as to what this has done to our country and individual rights.

As far as lack of character developement in the secondary characters, I disagree. I would love to meet somebody like Dr. Amy and I mourned when others (no spoiler here) were killed.

I'm not a published novelist, but it would scare the living bejeezus out of me to attempt a project like this. Spider had to know that he would draw lots of fire but he charged the machinegun nest anyway. Gotta give him credit for that. The only other person I could think of who might have even made a decent stab at it is John Varley. Give the poor Spider a break. Could YOU have done better?

I really enjoyed the aspects of both these writers. The book has the "soul" of Heinlein, but the "heart" of Spider. While Heinlein's characters take life in big bites, Spider's actually laugh out loud, especially at themselves. We can all use a little more of that
