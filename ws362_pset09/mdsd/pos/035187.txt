If you are looking for an audio version on tape, this is a fine option for this wonderful book. As you can see from all the glowing reviews, Wind in the Willows is a can't-miss classic. I bought the cassettes for a long car trip with a 5-year-old (we've read & re-read an abridged hardback) and while the story and characters provided much amusement for the full 10 hours, I was entirely sick of the narrator's syrupy voice and odd accents within 15 minutes. All that being said, if this is the only audio cassette version you can find, go for it.
