It may simply be the euphoria after reading a book but then how many books out there can leave one breathless, stunned and &quot;spaced-out&quot; after reading it? I remember nodding in marvel after reading Sebastian Faulks' Birdsong but there are more occassions when I threw them against the wall in exasperation, quite a number of them were award winning books too. I was taking a one week break from work to concentrate on a MBA assignment. During a lunch break, I choose a book which I think would be safe for an hour read and which I can discard safely without feeling a sense of attachment. I choose one with a cover of an uninteresting looking clergyman and you heard of the cliche about not judging a book by its cover, well, the lunch break became an extended break and I just have to finish it. My favourite soccer team lost, the office called with bad news, my ex was her typical unforgiving self when she called, empty stomach beckons but they were minor inconveniences! I have to finish it. This 'It' restores a sense of wonder and love of reading that I thought lost due to too many clever books that impressed judges with its complexity but seems to be devoid of good story-telling skills. Like Joseph Heller's Catch22, this book did not win any of the major awards it was nominated for, doesn't that tell us something? If you look at all the lists published in the Internet, the obsession is with the winners, I would love to see a listing of nominees and let history be the judge
