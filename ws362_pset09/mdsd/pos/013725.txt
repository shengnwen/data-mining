Viorst is deeply troubled by two segments of the Jewish population which have little use for the goals and thinking of the Western enlightenment: the religious - expansionist Zionists, and the ultra-orthodox Haredim.  He tries to put these movements into a historical and Biblical context as well as describing them in some detail.  It is a stretch to relate the Biblical Jewish tendency to revert to idolatry to the themes of this book, but the historical context is enlightening.  Unfortunately, I dont quite trust Viorsts scholarship when it comes to ancient history, which is treated in a rather cursory way even given the objectives of the book.  When it comes to modern Israel, Virosts writing is enriched by the many interviews he has conducted, often with people he totally disagrees with and even abhors, and he makes a definite effort to provide a fair account of their views and characters. Not withstanding this objectivity,  Viorst seems unable to truly credit genuine piety and faith, or the marvelous aspects of the Talmudic way.  Certainly, not all the traditional orthodox rabbis were acting out of pride and self-interest.  I found this annoying, even though I totally agree with Viorsts basic points.  This is an enlightening and scary book
