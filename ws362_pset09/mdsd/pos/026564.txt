Jawanza has laid it on the line, He has offered real world solutions for the problems plaguing our (the Black) community. He forces us to think and reconsider simply debating and discussing the problems. Most notable is when he articulates why we can not agree on what solutions should be used for our various problems and when we should offer those solutions. Brother Jawanaza writes we should never offer a solution until we agree on what the cause of the problem is. If we differ as to what we think is the cause of the problem we will be unable to come to a consensus as to what is the best solutions for the Problem. I recommend every thinking Black man and woman read this book if you are truly interested in reading about real world solutions to the problems plaguing the Black community
