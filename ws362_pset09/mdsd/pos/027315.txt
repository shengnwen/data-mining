well i got this book at a very cheap price along with other 2 classic titles (one by h.g. wells and the other by oscar wilde) and you can call me illiterate or whatever but this was the only book that kept me intrested enought to finish in less than a week.

this is my first by this author and i started reading with an open mind, as the one who had sumarized the book sugested. and ihave to say i loved it from start to beginning. not because of all the gore and porn, which was ok i guess but what i liked the most was how behind every libertine character's philosophy, is the idealism of the author, and those words are totally true and captivating. 

sade's philosohpy of life, a bit exagerated in this book; is admirable for the faithfulness it has to human's needs and drives and to sum it all..  if you want a bit of all that you should read this book. 
i recommend it
