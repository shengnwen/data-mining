The Peanuts comic strip has long been a favorite of mine, but until I read this book, I had never considered the psychology of the characters. Nearly all of them have severe psychological complexes. Charlie Brown has no confidence in himself, dreads all of life and nothing ever seems to go right. Lucy is so insecure that she has to punch anyone who disagrees with her and Linus has his blanket.
 In this book, Twerski uses some excerpts from the strip to demonstrate how to use a twelve- step program to take control of your life. The twelve steps are modeled from the famous twelve-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous. Twerski goes through the steps in sequence, explains what each entails and how to follow it, using one or more strips to demonstrate the point. This is an excellent approach to the construction of a self-help book. The cartoons are effective in emphasizing the points in ways that are very gentle. This lack of intensity is in sharp contrast to some other self-help books that figuratively stick it in your eye. 
 This book is a bit unusual, in that it is a self-help book with good advice that is just fun to read. I enjoyed it and recommend it to all people, whether or not they are in need of therapy.
