There's a lot of good in this book, and it's given me a few ideas for my own arts-and-crafts vernacular house, but at the same time it's frustrating.  Lots of the pictures feel (or explicitly state) that they're from houses much larger than the classic 900-2000 square foot bungalow.

Given that Taunton is also the publisher of The Not So Big House and a few books on cottages, it's a little strange to see bungalows recast so large, either built bigger or with additions tastefully tucked out of view from the street.  

While I like most of the details they show, their approach (perhaps necessary to include the new bungalows being built today) means that a lot of the coziness small bungalows naturally offered is missing, replaced by modern open plans and a lot of period trim and woodwork that can't quite make up the difference
