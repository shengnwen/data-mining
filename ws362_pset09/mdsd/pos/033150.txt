Author Paul Johnson did a masterful job of exposing both the genius and hypocrisy of the intellectual breed. The book is a fascinating historical accounting and a spicy gossip page simultaneously. The book is very fun to read and very informative. I have become a Paul Johnson fan and can't wait to read his other writings
