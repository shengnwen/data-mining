While the LP guides has a lot to say for them, both the latest and the previous guide book to Argentina+Uruguay+Paraguay share one serious flaw with all other LP guide books - all the prices are in US$, and all the countries in South America they have their own currency. 

Well, can't you just calculate prices in local currence from US$?

Wot's de currency rate?
In early 2000 1 US$ was 1.00 AR$
In mid 2001 1 US$ was 4.40 AR$
Today it's 3.02 AR$

Note that both of the latter dates are later than the Argentine/Uruguay currency disaster.

As for hotels and restaurants, all the major ones in SA have a web page - use that and not the PL guide book.

So in this respect an otherwise excellent guide book is No Go
