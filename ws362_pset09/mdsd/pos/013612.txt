This book is an excellent resource for anyone studying terrorism.   I used it as part of a bibliography for my final Army War College paper.  Though the paper was about National Missile Defense, I found an incredible amount of data I could use.  It is sober, insightful, and easy to read....unlike many books on the same topic.  I have loaned my copy to other Army officers as a primer for curent events.  Hope I get it back
