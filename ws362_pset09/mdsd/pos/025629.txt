I love a chef who understands what makes food taste good and why we need it to taste good.  These authors get it.  Some reviews give this book poor marks because of errors in the recipes.  They may be there but they haven't been a problem for me yet.  The book is fun to read, informative, and the recipes are flavorful and satisfying.
