this is my first time reading sedaris... i'm about 3/4 of the way through the book now... and i have to say, this guy is funny. i was up reading this book late into the night, curled up on the sofa beneath a lamp, rocking back and forth, biting my lip, weeping tears of merriment, trying to stifle my laughter so as not to wake the neighbors. 
many of the essays are mildly amusing, some leave you wearing an involuntary grin, but when he catches you off guard with an unexpected turn of phrase, the result is devastating hilarity, and you are left with watery eyes, aching sides, and a bubble of snot on your nose... or at least i was.
