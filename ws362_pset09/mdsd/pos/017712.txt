This book was wonderful, the moral being there are simple treasures in life, and not to focus on the stresses we encounter. Reading it a second time was even better for me, you can appreciate how the author combines the desperation of both main characters (the little prince and the pilot) in  one particular situation when the prince is asking if sheep eat roses and the pilot thinking its an unimportant question (when we all know in this book it was the MOST important question) the pilot is frusterated struggling to fix his plane and running low on water in the desert, and he snaps at the little prince who is distracting him with his talk of roses and sheep, not knowing the desperation and discontent the little prince is feeling over his worry of the rose he loves on his planet. fixing that plane was everything to the pilot, and protecting that rose was everything to the prince. great book! you wont look up in the sky after this without wondering about that rose
