It's great to have this book at last. The print book came out last year, but I've had to wait for the audio book. Simon Russle Beale narrates this, the fourth book in the series, and as with all the others, he does a grate job. 
With only one more book to go, according to rumour, the tension is mounting. The castle of mirrors is much darker than it's predecessors, and more atmospheric. We learn a lot of fascinating history about the red king and his family, and the ranks of the endowed children are swollen by three new arrivals. 
This book has a slightly more bitter sweet ending than the others. Charlie is no nearer to finding his father, and Billy makes a wonderful discovery, only to have his hopes dashed. The endowed children are now divided in to two distinct camps, making me feel that a final battle of the endowed is imminent. But the author will have to come up with a pretty spectacular climax if the next book is to be the last. Charlie is in his second year of school, and the series could easily continue over many more books. I await the next instalment with interest.
