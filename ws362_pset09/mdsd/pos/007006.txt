I just took a 3 week intensive Practitioner's Certification training course in California with Robert Dilts and I found this book to be really helpful with "people reading". I found some information we really didn't have time to go into in CA in this book. It is written cleanly and clearly on subjects that can be complex. I recommend it to anyone studying NLP for any reason
