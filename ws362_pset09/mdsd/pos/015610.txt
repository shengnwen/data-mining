I bought this book to help me with my forays into dreams and it gives an extensive amount of exercises to help with that.  Plus, I liked how the text wasn't weighed down with complicated Kabbalistic theory which would confuse beginners, though I wouldn't have minded a reference index that points to theoretical information for further research.  Another drawback is that the exercises do not come with a recommended practice timeframe, so it is unclear whether the reader does an exercise regularly for an indefinite period of time or if once is sufficient.  There is also no recommended timeframe to complete the series in the book.  

One is also left with the feeling that there's so much more that the author could've written about.  Short of moving to New York, where the dream institute is located, I'd love to see another book by the author further exploring the subject.  She's a great writer, and able to convey a lot of information very simply.  I'd also like for her to go a little more into the "whys" of the exercises, rather than just expect people to "do" without any explanation.  That's a great approach in a master-student scenario, but readers tend to want more information on why they're doing something
