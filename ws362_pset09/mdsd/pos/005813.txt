Finished this book today on the uptown train and let pass a moment of silence before my stop. J.G. Farrell was a prophet of the Lord of All Blessings. Hard to believe this book isn't required reading. It features one of the greatest depictions of combat I've ever read, a very funny study of more wacko brits and a scene of corpse embalming that features a one sided argument about labor exploitation. That sounds tiresome, but when Farrell is roundly mocking all parties, including the corpse, a good time is guaranteed. Not that the book isn't shot through with human empathy, but it's that empathy that appeals to our common humanity often for the purpose of cracking wise. All of this in no way obscures his pointed insights. If you want to find out what really matters, read Farrell and have confirmmed your sneakign suspicions.
