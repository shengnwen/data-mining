i must confess that I have always been more than a little disturbed by the cover of this book.  The stories featured in this book by Gogol deal with the desperate lives of the St Petersburg bureaucrats, Gogol was one and these are his people!  The best story is &quot;The Diary of a Madman&quot; and this deals with the adventures of one of these low grade civil servants who finds his plans and dreams continually frustrated. As a way out he gradually becomes convinced that he is destined for &quot;bigger and better things&quot; (I will not reveal more here, but will leave this to those who will discover just what this is by reading the story).  In his delusion, Gogol uses the technique of dislocation to describe the further adventures of his hapless hero and rarely is it used with greater comic effect.  Tolstoy was a master of this literary device,particularly when he wanted to satirize something of which he disapproved, but Gogol perfected it.  If one wants to see the beginnings of a rich tradition of humor in Russian literature, one cannot do any better than this book.  I still dislike the cover and believe that the editors of Penguin may be turning away more business than they generate by the rather off-putting artwork
