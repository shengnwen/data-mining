Regardless of how old you are and how long you've worked, you can always learn new tools to make you more effective in life.  A book that can add to your learning is It's Your Move - Dealing Yourself the Best Cards in Life and Work by Cyndi Maxey and Jill Bremer (Prentice Hall).  

The general design of the book and plan is a series of 52 techniques, or "cards", that you can play in your life in order to improve your effectiveness in life.  The techniques are grouped into a number of sets:  preparation, attitude, visibility, style, presentation, listening, learning, balance, and flexibility.  At the end of each chapter, you are instructed to "draw" one of the cards and start to apply it to your life.  By not being able to pick and choose what you want to do, you are forced to examine possibilities that you may shy away from if given your choice.

If  you've read books of this genre before, you'll recognize a number of the techniques...  take risks, set goals, etc.  But regardless of how many you've heard before, all it takes is one new idea to propel you forward.  Maxey and Bremer have an easy style of writing that makes it simple to understand and incorporate the idea into your life.  They also use actual personal stories to help the reader relate to the technique.  All good stuff...

Worth reading if you're looking to make a change in your life..
