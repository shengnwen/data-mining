Secrets of the Ancient Incas spoke to something deep inside of me. It gave me hope for earth and humanities future tied to the Inca's past. I am using the guided rituals in my day to day life and I love them.I feel as if I have been given an intrudution to a new set of comic guides. I have never been to Peru yet I now know, after reading this book, I have to go at some time. This book is one of those few books, I will save and reread again and again. I highly recommend it to anyone with an open mind
