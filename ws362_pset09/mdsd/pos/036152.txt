I tend to avoid buying just any book, because you read it one time and it has then outgrown its usefulness.  This book is one that is needed in every personal library.  It reads like a novel, but can most assuredly be used as a reference book.  Bowen is a master craftsman when it comes to biography.  You feel like you know them, without the use of superlatives.  Their merits stand on their own, with the help of the authors excellent research.  Miracle at Philadelphia is the blueprint to understanding that it truly was a miracle that the United States exists.  You will be a better person for reading it.  I love George Washington
