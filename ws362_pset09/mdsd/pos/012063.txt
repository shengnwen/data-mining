This is an enjoyable, tantalizing book, with some dull spots in the earlier chapters.  It is an account of Fisher's 3 years in Dijon, where she moved  in 1929 so that her new husband could pursue a doctorate.  She was 20 years old, bright, pretty, charming, in love,  and most of all, enthusiastic.  The reader gets caught up in all this, so as to overlook the book's serious drawback.  Fisher can write very nicely, but you learn much more about her landladies than her husband.  Fisher says of her sister Norah, "she TOO speaks always with reserve" (caps mine).  The book is written as if you are already acquainted with Fisher, as no doubt many readers are, but for the rest I would recommend, before starting the book, that they look up M.F.K. Fisher in Google and thereby get to the site about Fisher sponsored by Les Dames d'Escoffier International.
