Before reading this book, I was able to get my marathon time to the 3:10 range. A friend of mine gave me this book and I took the time to really read through it. It was easy to understand and it gave an excellent breakdown of the training cycles, nutrition, and physiology. If nothing else, the training programs are easy to follow, and they work. You can easily finda program that will meet your time and work demands. I've followed a couple of different programs, and I have taken my time down to 2:41, not bad for a 40 year old. Bottom line is this really works
