Though this book shares some similarites with "The Lexus and the Olive Tree" by Tom Friedman, this book stands up on it's own on the effects of globalization.

It is very well written and is easy enough for a laymen, but still is complicated enough for people with more back ground in these issues. Don't let the title fool you, it's not one-sided pro globalization and that's what makes this book so good.

He gives pros and cons of virtually every issue surrounding globalization today. I believe his analysis and applaud his honestly when dealing with some of the challanges of globalization. Child labor and enviromental standards were espically interesting to consider.

Above all this book makes you think about this issue that so much influencial our lives. It is a fair look at why globalization is the best way to generate wealth not only in our country but for the world. I think anyone who is interested in economics and the issue of globalization would be wise to read this book.

Even if you don't agree with globalization I suggest you read this book, it'll at least make you think about some of the points of the pro-globalization group are right about. If you believe in globalization it would good to read this book as well and think about the challanges to globalization and how we can best address them.

Unlike Lou Dobb's worthless garbage "Exporting America" Bhagwati takes a critical look at what globalization means to the world. This isn't a Lexus and the Olivetree clone both explore different issues
