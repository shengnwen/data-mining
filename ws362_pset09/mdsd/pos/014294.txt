First of all, let it be known that I bought this collection for one story by one of my favorite authors:  "The Wedding Album", which did not disappoint.  Of course, I had to get my money's worth by reading the whole thing.

There are some real gems in this collection:  Bear's gruesome classic "Blood Music", Ian Macleod's superb "Breathmoss", Sterling's "Dinner in Audoghast", "Daddy's World", and a few others.  Unfortunately, these excellent works stand up like islands in a sea of others that range from "good" to merely "competent".  There was one story in particular that had me scratching my head as to why it was included.

I agree with another reviewer, in that I understand that Dozois wanted to create a well-rounded collection precisely by not picking the most widely-read works.  That said, a collection of stories with the equally visceral punch of "Blood Music" and "The Wedding Album" would have really rocked my world.

Recommended.
