This book is a fascinating look into the life of Ben Hogan, a golfing legend by anyone's standard. This book reveals things about Hogan that are more important than his skill and achievements. This book reveals Hogan's intense determination and will. He was not a &quot;natural&quot;. It was this determination and will that made him great. The book also leaves you with the impression that Hogan not only had high standards for golf, but more importantly for life and how to live it. This book will definitely inspire golfers to become even better and I'm sure it would even inspire non-golfers as well. I've read many books in my lifetime, but aside from &quot;A Catcher in the Rye&quot;, this is the only book I've ever read twice
