  Hush, by Jacqueline Woodson, is a very interesting book.  Reading was like riding the Superman at Six-Flags.  The beginning of the book is kind of up tempo since the family is pretty happy and productive living together, but then it all goes downhill with a series of depressing which lead up to the fact that the family must enter the Witness Protection Program.  This book does have some racist moments, such as, "We thought it was gang related..." "Why, because he was black!"  So, even though this book is drama, it definitely makes you feel down more times than not.  Therefore, this book might not be suitable for kids under the age of 13 because the content is quite mature and may be slightly or very confusing for younger children.  The good thing is, though, the book has a great storyline that is easy to follow and the vocabulary is at a lower level, so it is very clear and understandable.  The novel is about a family that has to start a new life with the Witness Protection Program because a tragic event occurs that traumatizes the family's well being.  They do go through a lot of hardships, but they manage to pull through towards the end.  So, if you like dramas describing what just might happen to you when you least expect it, then I highly suggest Hush, a stupendous novel.
