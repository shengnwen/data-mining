I remember many of the examples in this book that created good and positive change. How just one small act makes a difference. Malcolm Gladwell offers simple and effective examples of how others have made a difference, and how you and I can too. 

I enjoyed reading this book and think it brings good solutions to people just at a time in our world when we could all really use them. This is a book I would suggest for anyone who would like to revive a spark inside to make a difference!
