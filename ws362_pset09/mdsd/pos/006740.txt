As far as action goes, this was a good book.  However, it is almost exactly like Stephen Coonts' FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER: a carrier pilot goes flying where he shouldn't during the Vietnam War after losing his second crewman, catches hell for it, and is barely saved by an act of Congress.  The only differences are that with RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, he's a Marine fighter jock instead of a Navy attack driver, and it happens near the beginning of the war instead of the end
