	The book "Children Of The River"  by: Linda Crew  is about a young girl named Sundra and her aunts family, who are traveling from Cambodia to America. Sundra and her aunts family don't know what happend to her family because they were unable to escape from Cambodia. It was hard for Sundra to live in America because they had to work from dawn to dusk trying to make enough money to live in a house and to buy food. When Sundra turns 18 years old she has to get married because it's a Cambodian tradition and, usually her parents would arrange the marrage but since her family was gone her aunt arranged the wedding. Sundra's uncle is forbidding her from seeing the American boy because he is "white" But Sundra really likes the boy and he really likes her. 
	My opinion on the book is that it was pretty good because there was really good details and, the author really discribed the characters. But it was hard to understand since there were harder words in it. I also thought that the book ws a little bit borring  at some parts. Maybe if there was more action in the book it would have been better. I would reccomend this book to people who like reading about culture and the different types of people and their historical background
