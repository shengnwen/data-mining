I read this book because Ray's first book, Julie and Romeo, had been so good I decided to follow up on her progress.  She is just as good in Step-Ball-Change.  The story starts off very unassuming with our two main characters having supper when the phone rings.  From there on it is one family catastrophe after another.  The story is funny and the main characters are interesting and true to life.  The secondary characters are also realistic.  Actually, one of the best characters in the book is a white terrier who is nervous and energetic and never bites anyone until...well, you'll see.    

Step-Ball-Change is a very funny story of family life.  The story encompasses the lives of both young and old characters and their happiness, trials, and tribulations and how each member of the family relates to one another in the context of those trying times.  

Step-Ball-Change is a funny and entertaining story and I recommend it highly.
