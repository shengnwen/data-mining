I people watch a lot and particularly like to watch the interaction between couples. I see giving and taking going on but not before reading &quot;The Givers and the Takers&quot; did all that interaction become clear. Giving or taking, alone, can become a great problem in relationships. &quot;The Givers and the Takers&quot; offers hope for either a giver or taker. Besides learning about the giving and taking of others, we can also learn about ourselves. Steps to creating a more balanced relationship can be found in this easy to read, easy to understand book if you're ready to take a look at yourself. I highly recommend this book
