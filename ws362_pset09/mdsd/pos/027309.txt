The Leadership Pipeline is an excellent resource that can be applied to various situations.  For example if this principle were applied to a local church setting. In a church setting this could be used in order to train people for various positions within the congregation, for example, Sunday school teaching.  If a person who demonstrates to be very knowledgeable in scripture, and desires to become involved in a church will move from what the book calls "managing self to managing others."  This person may be put in charge of a small bible study or better yet training others to teach Sunday school class within the church setting.  As time goes on this person may begin to train someone else to train others while he/she watches over the training that is done.  This is stage two according to the book "from managing others to managing managers."  A great deal of coaching comes into play here as well, as one person becomes the overseer of all of the Sunday school training of teachers.  After this a person moves to the next passage, which is "From managing managers to functional manager."  This person now begins to try to innovate the Sunday school curriculum with fresh and bright ideas.  While at the same time communicating with the other trainers to make sure everything is going ok, and that his/her ideas are good and can be used. Not every step from the book needs to be implemented but the concept could work for any position in the church that requires some sort of training
