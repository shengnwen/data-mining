Finally a book going against the grain of Hepburn's public image.  Mr Mann carefully and thoughtfully examines the differences between the ways Hepburn chose to present herself and the facts of her life..

Mr. Mann's sources are laudable in that they finally revealed their personal experiences and letters about what this complicated and not very admirable woman was all about.  The book deserves a high rating
