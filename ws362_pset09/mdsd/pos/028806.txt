I saw &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; at the contemporary arts center in new orleans two summers ago.  It was simply brilliant.  I was living across the street from Albee when he was in the city working on &quot;Fragments.&quot;   Unfortunately I didn't get to see the show or get the opportunity to meet  him in person.  His ability to evoke so much emotion from the viewer  astounded me.  I was crying a LOT...during this play.  Edward Albee is an  extremely clever man
