"Amusing Ourselves to Death" is an excellent book that everyone living in the "information age" should read.  Neil Postman insightfully takes a look at how public discourse has changed as American culture has transformed from a print-based culture to a television-based culture.  Postman contends that television has turned everything- from news to politics to religion- into entertainment, and that we no longer take anything seriously as a culture.
Postman warns that when we see every area of life as a form of entertainment, we are seeing Adlus Huxley's warnings coming true.  We are quickly headed towards living in a "Brave New World"
