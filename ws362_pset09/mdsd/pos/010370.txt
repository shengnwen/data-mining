This book is an easy and enjoyable read about a difficult philosophical topic.  It deals with the practical reality of the exisence of evil and ties it to a combination of random chance and people's free will.  That is the underlying thesis and deep philosophical arguments are avoided.

What this book does have is practical wisdom and common sense arguments.  I think this is what the average reader is looking for and Rabbi Kushner achieves this gold within a Judeo-Christian worldview.  However, his arguments would appeal to people of many traditions.  At a minimum, the text would be good food for those who embrace vastly different worldviews.

I rated this book a 4 rather than 5 primarily because I would have liked to have seen a bit more philosophical depth.  However, I still think the book is well worth reading for all of the reasons I mention above.  This is high quality, but not the right book to weigh various perspectives and contast them
