This book has some very snazzy packaging and you can even get it inside a cereal box. Seth Godin knows how to get people's attention and mine was fully captivated as I devoured this book. Free Prize is full of Seth's musings on how to create "soft innovations" within an organisation. A soft innovation being a "clever, insightful, useful small idea that just about anyone in an organisation can think up". If you want a book to get you thinking outside the (cereal) box and to get your brain on a different planet where those cool things you and your friends talk about may actually one day be dreamed up by you - this is the book. As I was reading it I was constantly bugging my family with snippets from it like the idea he had for randomly putting $100's in the $20 slot of an ATM as a promotional idea or the gardening company who provided quotes from satellite photographs and sent them out on frisbees.
