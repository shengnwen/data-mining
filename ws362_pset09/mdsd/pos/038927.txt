This is a great book that was so interesting I couldn't put it down. There are so many things to think about when writing a love letter. She really puts it out there, I'm glad I got this book and just love it. After reading some other reviews, I got a copy of "Romeo's Playbook" and would also suggest it. My husband loves it and now he is my Romeo. He understands me now and our love life has exploded with excitement!
