Read this right after reading his childhood tale, Running with Scissors.  This is more believable, more relatable and more heartbreaking.  This is the one they should have made a film out of.  At times I was proud of him, disgusted with him, sad for him, and found myself rooting for him.  A sign of a well written book.  Can't wait to read the next installment
