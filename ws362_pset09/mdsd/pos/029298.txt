When I started learning bellydance in my home on video, I searched the web for more Information.  I found this book. I liked it so much by just being able to read some of the book(A Big THANKS for that!!).  Maybe some things are made up but it is to me, a story & a learning tool for belldancing. The author makes me feel like I'm right there with her.  She is very discriptive and I can visualize every thing. The price was right,it came packaged in good condition and did'nt take a long time to receive it. Thanks!
