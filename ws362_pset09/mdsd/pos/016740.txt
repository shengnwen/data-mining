"The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter" is a fun and easy to read breeze through some of the myths and folklore that JK Rowling used to create her uber-popular Harry Potter world.  I'd especially recommend it for kids who want an entertaining way to dig a little deeper into the novels.  The comparison of Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory to the Knights of the Round Table, the history of Avada Kedavra and the "real" famous chocolate frog wizards all make you appreciate the attention to detail in Rowling's world - and some of the factoids are pretty insightful.  My only complaint about the book is that, with the publication of "Order of the Phoenix" and "Half Blood Prince," it's gotten a bit outdated.  I'd adore a seeing a revised version from David Colbert one of these days
