Interesting tale of a prior investigator (Nick Petrov) who had gained fame for cracking a serial murder case.  He is hired by a woman to track down her daughter.  What seems like a typical missing persons case then starts to turn weird and strange people seem to be attacking Nick.  When it looks like he made some headway in the case, Nick has a severe medical problem that causes him to have amnesia including not being able to remember anything about the missing girl case.

Nick comes across some of the items he had collected from the missing girl case and realizes they must mean something.  Little by little he starts to piece things together and get up to speed to the point he was before amnesia.  The more Nick learns, he seems to realize that maybe this was more than a missing girl case and maybe it is related somehow to the serial killer case that he had worked on.

Some parts of the book are slow and others are a little difficult to understand but the reader wants to learn everything they can along with Nick.  So many clues need to be pieced together to figure out and tie all the loose ends.

Nick is an extremely interesting character because he was a smug, domineering individual before his illness and after his illness he tries with difficulty to be the same way but is stifled by his new physical shortcomings.

A good read!
