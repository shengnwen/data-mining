SY-My book is The Black Pearl By Scot O' Dell.  It is about a boy named Ramon who becomes a pearl salesman in his fathers business.  The boy finds a huge pearl in the lagoon of the monster Manta Diablo.  Worth so much money that the four huge pearl salesmen in their town cannot pay for it.  The pearl seems great but soon causes many misfortunes.  The story is set in a town called La Paz somewhere in Baja California.  I am guessing that it is in the eighteen hundreds because there are no cars and all the boats are either canoes, or sail boats.  The main characters are the boy named Ramon, who is sixteen years old and works in his fathers pearl business called Salazar and Son.  An Indian named Luzon, who teaches Ramon how to dive for pearls, but was against Ramon diving in the lagoon of the Manta Diablo because Luzon fears the creature.  The last main character is a man who is called The Sevillano.  The Sevillano is a very strong man who claims he has done incredible things all across the world and is not very good friends with Ramon.  I would recommend this book.  It was sort of slow at the beginning, but then it got really interesting.  I would recommend it to boys and girls at the age of twelve because even though it wasn't very long, it was kind of complicated.  Anyone who enjoys mysteries would probably like this book
