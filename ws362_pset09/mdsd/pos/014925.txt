As the author notes in the introductory epigram, "For historians ... reactions to Marat are a touchstone of feelings about the French Revolution. (1) Jean Paul Marat has always been a polarizing historical figure. Conservative historians (e.g., Harlow Giles Unger's Lafayette biography) portray him as unflatteringly as possible, while socialist historians and leftist playwrights have romanticized his revolutionary enthusiasms.

Clifford Conner avoids these pitfalls. He is not interested in "liking or disliking Marat or of empathizing with him or not." (5) He admires historian Georges Lefebvre's still-standard and still-indispensable synthesis, and asserts that subsequent revionists have been woefully inconsistent in their evaluations of Marat's historical contributions. He exposes their allegations (e.g., Marat was a criminal, Marat was insane, Marat was a charlatan) as unwarranted and unsubstantiated.  

Conner's major reassessment revolves around Marat the scientist (5 chapters) rather than just Marat the agitator and revoluionary (3 chapters). What was Marat's life before 1789? Public political activism only entailed the final four years of his life, and his martydom.
 
Conner's prose is crisp and jargon-free. He succeeds in filling the "void" of no new English language biographies of Marat since 1927! In an unfortunate era where some Americans bash the French for no good reason, any English-language reader the least bit interested in the initial phases of the French Revolution (1789-1793)will be enlightened by this biography of l'Ami du Peuple (the friend of the people). It's the best currently available among amazon.com's offerings on Marat.
