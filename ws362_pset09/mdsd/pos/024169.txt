This is a book a bout a young man who is born into poverty but overcomes all challenges he is faced with. Allen practices all his life and is able to make it to the NBA.This book is great because it tells you about alot of basketball games that Allen played in. The author really gets you into the game it feels like you are in the fans watching the game. There was nothing about this book that I didnt like. A part that I really liked was when Allen said "This was a perfect ending to a day" I liked it because i could get excactly what he was saying. If you love basketball you should get this book as soon as possible
