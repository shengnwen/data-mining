Tesla explains he had extremely sensitive senses. He claimed he could hear a watch ticking three rooms away (with the doors closed). His visual sense was so strong that he would test inventions in his head. Only after all the errors were fixed using his imaginary invention model, would Tesla physically construct the device. This method of working saved him a lot of money and time.

It's insights like these, which make this book fascinating. Biographers can spin a narrative for you - what Tesla did and when. But only Tesla can tell you what it was like to be Tesla.

As another reviewer noted - this book can be read for free, online - if you search around enough. It's worth it
