I haven't read this book in about 20 minutes, although I'm sure it has been out of print for over 20 years.  A must read for anyone who reads.  Patchen works the magic of a thousand men fasting.  A must-read before  you're sent on a pilgrimage.  I hope this edition costs the same as the one  I now have from the library: $1.95.  If not, I hope it is less than $35, or  else I'll steal it from the library in New Jersey, because that is the fine  for losing a book checked out from there
