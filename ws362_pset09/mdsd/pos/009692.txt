The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of five is that it doesn't cover digital backs.  That said I guess this was written a few years ago before the digital revolution came on so strong.  I had some information on large format cameras because I took the NYIP correspondence course and knew a little about them, but wanted to know things like how to load film in them, which the NYIP course didn't cover.  He went into how the tilt and rise adjustments can make your photography like no other camera can.  I found this book very complete and is a great book to find out if LF is for you.  I also bought the book Large Format Nature Photography and that does go into digital a little, however he doesn't think much of it so maybe that is why this author left it out.  I don't think you would be disappointed with this book.
