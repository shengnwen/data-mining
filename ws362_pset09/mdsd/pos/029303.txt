The only other reviewer (to date) has made a fair point about the density of the essays collected here and the relative obscurity of some of the subject matter.  But he/she has missed the larger point of this whole volume by dwelling on the perceived shortcomings of a single article.  Until recently, scholars of American Studies, literature, and history have largely ignored the role of imperialism in the development of American culture.  Since the early 1990s, some scholars have attempted to set this right by paying more attention to issues like immigration, race and gender identity, travel, and American empire (Philippines, Cuba, Panama, etc.).

This collection of essays brings together some of the finest scholars who have worked in this area during the past decade:  Amy Kaplan, Donald Pease, Walter Benn Michaels, John Carlos Rowe, Kenneth Warren, and many more.  Their work is certainly of the academic variety, and it can be frustrating to readers who are searching for clear-cut, black-or-white arguments.  But as a self-described democracy with a protracted history of slavery, institutionalized racism and sexism, and shady imperialist ventures, U.S. culture defies simple, straightforward answers.  The writers of these essays understand this difficulty and theorize accordingly.  Anyone seeking to understand a fairly recent but very significant development in American Studies, history and literature would be highly advised to puruse this volume.  It will continue to play a major role in each of those disciplines for at least the next decade.

Still, I acknowledge the other reviewer's frustration and want to point out this is definitely NOT light reading.  And some of the essays are far more intellectually rigorous than others.  However, if you start with Kaplan's excellent introduction, you should get a sense of what the collective goal of these scholars is, and you can get a handle on what each of them writes -- even if a particular essay isn't very stimulating
