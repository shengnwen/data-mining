From Good to Great was recommended to me by my talented CEO. He said to me one time 'I want to do this with our company, I know it is doable, and we are going to do it'. So I took on reading it, a bit skeptically, and it taught to me that success is, as T. A. Edison put it, 10% luck and personal talent and 90% hard work. The interesting thing is that when the 90% of work is done in the proper way, success arises. Collins' book studies the patterns found in the management of many good companies a few of which became great companies. There is over and over again the 'David VS Goliath' story of two companies, one had it all and the other had very little, and how the result of poor management of the Goliath companies led them into extinction, and how the little David companies, by a combination of good management, right team, and a strong corporate honesty, integrity and discipline were led to total success against all odds. 
	
Collins goes on to say that success does not come from working 100 hour weeks, rather from working 40 hours weeks with all the efforts put in the right direction, with all the right people doing exactly what they were hired to do. It sounds very good, and I feel so lucky to be working in a company which is willing to put this theory into practice.

The book is well written and each chapter can be read separately. I actually read it on three consecutive Sundays while laying down in front of the Pacific Ocean, and enjoyed it from cover to cover
