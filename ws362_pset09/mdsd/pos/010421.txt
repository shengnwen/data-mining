"The Dragonslayer" is the fourth volume in the Bone series.  The story really moves quickly in this book.  Even the humorous sections are focused on the storyline, which wasn't always the case in the previous books.  This is another outstanding volume in the series.

We learn a lot about Thorn in this book; her relationship with Rose, and with the Dragons.  She questions her abilities, and her resolve, but ultimately she rises to the occasion.  Fone sticks by her loyally throughout, but the most interesting relationship has to be between Rose and Thorn.  Thorn is very critical of the way Grandma Rose has kept information from her, and she does not hold back her opinion.  Rose is dejected, and disappears fairly early on in the book.  Phoney Bone continues his plotting to scam the villagers and return to Boneville after taking their stuff.  Lucius is trying to locate Rose after she disappears, and Smiley Bone continues to provide some lightness to the story.  A continuing mystery is the cloaked men, who show up periodically, but arrive just in time at the end of this book
