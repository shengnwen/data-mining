As a non-vegetarian who is allergic to a slew of common veggies and fruits (including apples, nuts, and carrots), I have also, over the years, become allergic to vegetarian cookbooks.  This cookbook was loaned to me by a friend who knows about my allergies, and upon first inspection, I found 20 recipes I am not only interested in trying (although I haven't yet tried them), but that I can prepare without having to substitute anything.  Lots of variety, lots of off-the-beaten-path ingredients.  I didn't even notice it was a vegetarian cookbook until I got to Amazon to order it and read the reviews.  I am truly looking forward to getting my own copy and trying out some of these recipes
