Good sets out to prove that we are, and have been, visited by UFO's for a long long time. Using witness testimony and other evidence. He claims that the government has known about this since at least 1947 and is keeping it from the general population for their own agenda. A pretty interesting book. He covers UFO sightings from all over the world as well as here in North America. You can also tell from reading this book that the author has done a lot of research into this subject.
