My daughter does not enjoy reading.  However, when she discovered the Junie B. Jones series, she loves them & reads them over & over.  Her favorite is the Beauty Shop Guy & this one.  They are funny, & enjoyable.  However, I will caution that if a child is influenced easily they may not be the best.  Junie B. Jones is a lot like Nick's Rugrats--they are always into mischeif, and don't behave the best.  She also talks in 3rd person and doesn't have the best grammar.  With that said, if taken appropriately as entertainment, they are very funny, you never know what she's going to do next.  We love them, but I know a few who do not appreciate them
