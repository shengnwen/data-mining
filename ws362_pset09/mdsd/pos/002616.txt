In this book Conway-Morris makes an interesting argument on the animals of Burguess Shale. But in order to understand it, a previous reading of 'Wonderful Life' by Stephen J. Gould is useful. Not only because  Conway-Morris criticizes the argumnent of Gould, and he deny the importance  of 'contingency' or of the 'weird wonders' in order to understand evolution  and Burguess Shale. The other reason is that the Gould's book is more  detailed and informative in his presentation of the animals of Burguess  Shale. The lack of detail in the arguments of Conway-Morris damage his  case: For example, when Gould wants to show that Anomalocaris is a weird  wonder, he makes a detailed presentation of its anatomy, but Conway-Morris  only presents a brief sketch of the reasons of why Anomalocaris can be seen  as a special kind of arthropod. This is regrettable because the arguments  of Conway-Morris benefit from detailed presentation, as in his discussion  of Wiwaxia or his presentation of the concept of disparity
