"The Dangerous Hour" is the 23rd Sharon McCone novel by Marcia Muller. One of Sharon's newest operatives, Julia Rafael, is arrested and charged with grand theft. The police say she used a credit card belonging to Alex Aguilar, a man who has great political aspirations. Aguilar then goes to the Department of Consumer Affairs and lodges a complain against McCone's agency. Aguilar had been a previous client of the firm. The DCA licenses her agency. The BSIS - Bureau of Investigative Services - would perform an audit and could take Sharon's license away. An attempt is made on Julia's life and someone shoots at Mick, Sharon's nephew and operative. Sharon wonders who hates her enough to want to ruin her.  She realizes that someone wants to do great harm to her. This novel has the usual cast of characters that are in the McCone novels. I think Marcia Muller still has the best female investigator in mystery fiction. This novel is full of suspense and is highly recommended
