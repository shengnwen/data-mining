HEARTSTOPPER by Joy Fielding
Amazon Rating: 4/5 stars 

Joy Fielding's latest thriller is a page-turner.  Starting with the opening chapter that comes straight from the killer's journal, the reader will enjoy HEARTSTOPPER until the killer is finally revealed. In a nutshell, the story takes place in a small Florida town, where a pretty (and popular) young teenage girl has gone missing.  When her body turns up, the town begins to talk, and soon people realize there is a murderer on the loose.   Signs point to a serial killer, and now it's up to the authorities to find him.  In between the murder mystery, the story delves into the lives of several key characters, with varying viewpoints to allow the reader to try to figure out who the killer is.  A very enjoyable book!

I've read a few Joy Fielding books, and have enjoyed each one, but this book I think out of all of them had the most potential for some gruesome violent scenes.  However, there is not much gore depicted at all, and a lot is left to the reader's imagination, which I found refreshing.  Fans of Fielding will enjoy HEART STOPPER. I read it in two days flat, and did not figure out the killer until the end. It's probably going to be one of my favorite Joy Fielding books so far
