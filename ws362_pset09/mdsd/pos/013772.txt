Hollinghurst has written such an amazing novel here, a fine piece of social criticsm, with stunning prose that is tempered and subtle and evenly paced.  It would be perhaps too extreme to say that the world in which these characters move is a glittering one, disgusing the moral rot beneath, for none of these characters are completely irredeemable.  Their impulses and flaws are all too human.  But it is the social conventions and intolerances that entrap them and mandate a sense of propriety that lead to their downfall.  This is a book that builds incredibly slowly, picking up the tiniest strands of drama along the way, and all comes to a devestating and inevitable crash, where everyone and no one is at fault
