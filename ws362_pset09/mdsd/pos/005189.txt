I found the book very inspiring. The pictures in this book were meant as examples to push and inspire your imagine instead of taking a cookie cutter approach.  The book also provides principles and strategies on how to implement your own ideas. However, the pictures provide primarily a modern and contemporary perspective for those of you who are die heart country chic or traditional.
