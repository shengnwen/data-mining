Intrepid private investigator Carlotta Carlyle is approached by a man who claims that he has received a manuscript written by a girl who disappeared as a young teenager some 24 years ago.  The girl, Thea Janis, wrote a brilliant and successful book at a very early age and then disappeared.  When Carlotta begins to investigate, she finds that Thea was reported dead many years ago.  She begins to investigate Thea's wealthy and politically-active family and begins to uncover some skeletons in the closet.  She works with her old police buddy, Mooney, and after several red herrings, begins to unravel a tangled web of lies and deceit that run very deep in Thea's family.  Some of the familiar elements of this series are missing in this book.  Carlotta plays nary a game of volleyball and her little sister Paolina is absent until the very end of the book.  A parting of the ways occurs between Carlotta and her current lover with suddenness and fury over a seemingly minor matter.  Also, the presence of Paolina's father lurks furtively in the shadows, but never really makes an impact on the story.  Other than this, readers should enjoy this entry in the series
