"If you had to reduce all of Spalding's work to its essence, its core," Francine Prose writes in her Foreward to Gray's last major monologue, "if you wanted to locate the subject to which, no matter what else he talked about, he kept returning, I suppose you could say that his work was a profoundly metaphysical inquiry into how we manage to live despite the knowledge we are someday going to die.  How are we to love the world and the people we care about most even when we know that someday we will lose it all and our loved ones will have to continue without us" (pp. 43-44)?

Perhaps best known for SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA (1988) and GRAY'S ANATOMY (1994), Spalding Gray committed suicide last year at the age of 62, leaving behind his wife, Kathleen Russo, a stepdaughter, Marissa, and two sons, Forrest and Theo.  In his unfinished work in progress, LIFE INTERRUPTED, Gray tells of his trip to Ireland to celebrate his 60th birthday, which ended with a gruesome car crash leaving him severely injured and depressed.  That incident not only became the catalyst for Gray's return to writing from his "quiet life" of domestic bliss in Sag Harbor, but the turning point in his life, ultimately leading to suicide.  From the transvestite with green fingernails offering him toast and tea (p. 67-68), to his Pakastani doctors, to his attempts to try to get along with the blaring televisions (p. 71), to his musings on how an intelligent country like America could "elect such a dud like George Bush" (p. 80), Gray finds never-ending humor in his grim predicament, while recovering from his injuries in an Irish country hospital.  Spalding Gray's parting monologue offers such sweet sorrow.

The book concludes with several short eulogies by Gray's friends (Laurie Anderson, John Perry Barlow, Eric Bogosian, Eric Stoltz and many more), delivered in memorial services at Lincoln Center and in Sag Harbor.
