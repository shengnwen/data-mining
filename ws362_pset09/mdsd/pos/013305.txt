Judy's stories are creative and clever in unexpected ways.  I had to pace myself so I wouldn't finish the book too fast, each story was a treat that I looked forward to reading.  Some of the stories are truly astonishing and  disturbing.  There is a wicked streak in stories like the cheerleader story  and the first story was one of my favorites.  It's definitely a book of  stories you'll want to read again
