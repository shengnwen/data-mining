P in your pants funny! Forget the comparisons to David Sedaris. Yes they both live or have lived in New York, yes they have seen male parts other than their own up close, but it pretty much ends there. He does call to mind other grumpy gayboys but he's far gayer and way more bitter, Bless him. He's Canadian (any country that sells codeine over the counter is OK by me), he's smart enough to go to horrific tourist traps, is bitchy EVEN in Hebrew, and despises Robin Williams and that guy who made "Life is Beautiful" ... I bet he hates countryman Jim Carrey as well. All that AND he's a nice Jewish boy? He's like a Fran Lebowitz I'd SLEEP with!

Oh, and I almost forgot... he's the only writer I can remember who specifically mentions Xanax, sperm banks, the dubious lama-hood of Steven Seagal, and the "Internationale" all in one book ... Que RICO
