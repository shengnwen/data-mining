Honest books have helped me with everything from marriage to food, and I was itching for one about money. Here it is! The only parts I skimmed were a few of the story anecdotes (felt like filler) and many of the study statistics, which seemed like negative motivation (doomsday perspectives never inspire me). My favorite part was the beginning, where the most soul-baring takes place; it helped me venture into my own depths. Truth sets you free, whether it's someone else's or your own, and there is freedom here for all of us
