The arrival of the new BP annual means one thing: baseball season is here once again!  As usual, I tore through my new BP annual, eager to devour their essays and projections.  The essays are top-notch, the stats are numerous and interesting, and overall the book was fantastic.

A few essays weren't up to snuff, however.  The White Sox piece barely dealt at all with the team itself, and considering that they won the World Series I found that surprising.

The main problem with the book is the ridiculous number of typos and grammatical mistakes.  The more I encountered, the more I wondered how rushed this was. And then I began to wonder if there was a correlation between the number of typos and the quality of the analysis.  I am a big fan of BP, and subscribe to their website, and I don't recall ever being subjected to this number of mistakes in a month of articles.

This is from the opening paragraph of the Cardinals essay:   "For all the talk about Oakland's lack of resources, the Cardinals haven't had a significantly better they've done a much better job..."

There must be at least 50 such mistakes in this book. While the overall impression of the book was positive, the carelessness in the editing is an issue
