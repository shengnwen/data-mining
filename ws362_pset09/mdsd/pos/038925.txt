So far, I have only read the half of the book on Pagan Rome, as that is my  hobby these days. It was interesting in parts; illustrative of things I had  not known or even suspected, things I had read allusions to  previously, and  things I never would even have thought studied. Some of  the cross cultural  comparisions were beautifully illustrative (one that  sticks was a comparison  between the economy of a present day middle  eastern country to that of the  Empire). I am pretty sure this suffered  from some sort of idiological bias,  as it was weirdly contradictory in  places, though it is an original enough  bias that it it probably unique to  the authors. One of the authors at least, seemed to be an intimate of  Michel Foucault. They were all french, and the prose suffers for it to the  point of being occasionally downright nonsensical. The book certainly rid  me of any &quot;golden age&quot; delusions I might have,  regarding Roman  times. I'll stick with my electric can opener, thanks very  much
