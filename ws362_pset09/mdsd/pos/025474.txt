So I went Franken on Franken and did a little checking of my own with a LexisNexis account and I have to say that he is right almost all of the time.  Good for Al to tell people the truth.  I felt connected to Al in so many ways greater than just a reader.  I felt as if I were sipping coffee with the man and listening to his political tirades and family anecdotes.  

Ended up also buying the audiobook and Al's voice really takes it aways.
