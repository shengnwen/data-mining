Except for silk yarn (derived from silkworms, which are boiled in the process of silk making and therefore NOT vegan) most of the yarns in this book are from non-animal origins. There are rayon yarns from various sources of cellulose including algae (Sea-Cell), corn, bamboo. There are silks from soy (the protein is spun into a silk-like fiber) and there are cotton-linen type yarns like uh, cotton, hemp, and ramie.

The book features patterns for scarves, collars, sweaters, cardigans, socks and bags from both natural fibers and man-made like acrylic and nylon. The most useful patterns, to me, were the tank tops in yarns that would stand summer heat well. There are a number of models that are men's patterns, rather rare in books these days.

None of the models are earthshakingly designed but there is a wide variety of styles and knitting types to suit most knitters. The real value in the book is in the introductory discussion of fibers OTHER than wool, which is interesting reading and good if you are wool-allergic or looking for vegan yarns. Not a must-have book, but an interesting read and a set of patterns that will have one or two to suit most tastes
