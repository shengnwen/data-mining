     Mutation is a science fiction mystery. It is a well written and thought out plot consisting of a genetic experiment, a child prodigy, murders, and a secret lab. The main character, Victor, has tunnel vision when it comes to his experiments. His lack of thinking ahead gives him a "guilty yet insane" sort of demeanor. He adds the sense that you know the truth, but don't want to; a very convincing character capable of conveying his thoughts without the reader having to read them. VJ is a hard character to read. . VJ, however, is supposed to be hard to predict. It is his basic personality. He has a very dark and secretive life, and is never one that likes to cuddle with his mom. He has no conscience or sense of right or wrong. VJ is the most surrealistic part of the story; being a child prodigy and all. This book has a very surprise ending that would encourage a sequel. I haven't found one yet if there is one. Anyway, this is an overall good book with a lot of red herrings and some dramatic irony. This is a good weekend read for the science fiction or medical mystery fan.
