I read Jahnke's latest book, The Healing Promise of Qi, and loved it.  I was so impressed with the clarity of Jahnke's explanations that I bought The Healer Within. I was not disappointed. The exercises in this book are accessible and simple to apply to everyday living, the explanations clear and concise. I have found the techniques beneficial for cultivating health and vitality. An excellent introduction not only to Chinese medicine, but also to the principles of energy medicine and quantum healing
