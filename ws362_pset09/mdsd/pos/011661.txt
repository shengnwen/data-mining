Cassie Barrett Rivers is found wandering around in a cemetery with a case of amnesia.  When her picture is published, her husband comes to pick her up, and to everyone's surprise, he is a famous movie star, Alex Rivers.  Gradually Cassie's memory returns, although this is not described or explained well in the book.  She begins to remember meeting Alex in Africa where she was asked to serve as a consultant on the set of a movie in which he portrays an archeologist, Cassie's real-life occupation.  Alex wines and dines her and eventually asks her to marry him.  They feel that they are perfectly suited to one another and are very much in love.  However, the perfect picture is marred when Alex begins abusing Cassie, as a reaction to his own abusive childhood.  In the typical way of battered wives, Cassie covers for Alex and tells herself that things will get better.  Eventually she depends on the half/white, half/Lakota police officer who found her in the cemetery to help rescue her from a bad situation.  The mysticism of the Lakota culture is part of the book, but somehow doesn't fit well with the rest of the story.  Despite its flaws, the book did hold my attention because of the interesting characters created by author Picoult
