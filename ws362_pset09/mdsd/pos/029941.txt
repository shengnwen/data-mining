Some say this book is hard to read. I found it quite the opposite. The book is concise, which means it takes sometime to go through each page. But the amount of information one gets is worth the effort. One downside though are the problem sets in each chapter. Most of the problems are similar and there are very few variations. Nonetheless, if you have money to spend on a sigle book on this topic this is the book to have, at least for electrical engineers and computer scientists.
