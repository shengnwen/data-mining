Gelman's book is an excellent and complete introduction to Bayesian methods.  It covers a number of topics not touched by other intros I've read, and focuses much more on regression and ANOVA than other texts.

There are two downsides, coming from someone in psychology.  First, the book seems to hover between an introductory text and a more advanced one.  The topics covered are mostly introductory, but the examples aren't always entirely easy to follow.  A tighter integration with the R and Bugs code would help.  Perhaps a section at the end of the chapters containing a code example for each topic would be ideal. It's not that the topics themselves are necessarily opaque, but Gelman moves too fast at times, making it hard to think in terms of notation, theory, experimental design AND code at the same time (for those of us constantly thinking about how this affects our own research).

Second, as a general rule, this book is outside the ken of most psychologists.  This is unfortunate since the methods are ideal for our discipline, and since many psychologists already perceive a large barrier of entry to statistics.  As a psychologist with minimal undergraduate training in stats, I would (and did) start with a standard statistics book like Casella and Berger, and then move on to a gentler introduction to Bayesian methodology, like _Bayesian Methods: A Social and Behavioral Sciences Approach_ by Jeff Gill.  Also, you can barely do anything in this book with SPSS so you'll have to learn R and Bugs
