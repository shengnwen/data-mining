Geography: Realms, Regions and Concepts is an excellent text which provides the student with all information relevant to understanding geography on a whole; its regions and landforms, climate, politics and people.  There is adequate information for every area of the world, and I am very pleased my instructor required this text.

I would highly recommend this book or any other editions of the author, de Blij, to teachers and students alike
