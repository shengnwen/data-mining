Jack and Jill is another Alex Cross novel by James Patterson.  I have loved his characterizations, and enjoy his favorite protagonist Alex Cross whose only fault, it seems to me, is spending too much time working and not enough with his family!  He's not too good at love either!

People are being killed who are powerful and part of the Washington DC scene.  Another death occurs in the poor part of town, and the psychologist/detective is a little sour because the death of a child from the ghetto does not get the same detective work as the death of a bigshot on the hill.

The story follows both murders, plus a little of Alex's home life.  The master of the plot has many twists and turns as the crimes get solved.  I really enjoyed it
