This book is called UPDATING Bungalows!  Amazon is a wonderful resource because you can browse pages before you buy.  This book should not be a disappointment for those who are paying attention.

I am now the proud owner of a 1922 California Bungalow.  I have no illusions that this was the tract home of its day (I have found 4 others exactly like it in my neighborhood).  This book embraces the ideals of the bungalow and the intent of the lifestyle completely.  Not all of us can live in rarified homes in Pasadena or Chicago, and a strict period restoration with Stickley furnishings may not be practical for our lives in the 21st century.  This book is about UPDATING what you have to balance the traditional Craftsman aesthetic with modern sensibilities.  

For those who are hard core Craftsman enthusiasts bent on a period correct restoration, this is not the book for you.  If you live in the modern world but respect the ideals of the era, check this out.  There are plenty of good ideas, and a few photos of loving restorations too.
