James Finley's book, &quot;The Contemplative Heart,&quot; recommended to me by a friend, is a gentle, melodious and profound treatise on connecting with God and spirit through the practice of mindfulness and contemplation.  Though Finley comes from a Catholic tradition--and in fact spent many years  studying under the great Thomas Merton--the book is pleasingly devoid of  religious dogma or rhetoric, stripping from God the millenia of  human-created trappings and faces we have hung on Her and returning her to  us, naked and relevant. The premise rests in a mystical and vaguely  Buddhist notion that we can have a direct experience of the the presence  and creativity of God when we are contemplatively aware of our present  moment, whether sitting on a hill looking over the ocean, or stuck in  traffic. He presents to us the availability of contemplative experience  through meditation, and gives us a practical roadmap to assist us with our  inevitable distraction and resistance. Finley's language itself helps take  us there, creating in its repetitious, poetic cadence a mantra of sorts  which soothes and readies us for contemplative awareness. But Finley  cautions us too against the trappings of &quot;mystical thought,&quot; as  his contemplative path is practical and unromantic. You won't suddenly be  &quot;awakened,&quot; God will not appear magically to you in a burning  bush or a plate of spaghetti. But if you commit yourself to simply being in  the present moment, you may find yourself awakened to the divine creative  wonder and mystery inherent in our very existence at any given moment of  our lives. That is the true beauty and gift James Finley gives us with  &quot;The Contemplative Heart&quot;--access to our own &quot;contemplative  heart,&quot; and through that, access in turn to the heart and soul of God
