Before Bush's administration began its war in Iraq, I wrote a letter to the editor of my hometown newspaper because I wanted to be on record opposing what appeared to me at that time as a poorly considered response to the 9/11 attack on the U.S.  The point of my letter was to warn that Bush was leading America straight into what would turn out to be a devastating quagmire. Given the secrecy and propaganda that has kept regular citizens in the dark regarding the aftermath of our invasion of Iraq, it has only been frustrating watching what appears to be a bungled mess, as I predicted, but not getting any particulars from news coverage or from our elected officials.  For those like me who have wanted to read about what really was going through the Bush administration's minds and how such terrible outcomes affecting so many thousands of Americans and Iraqis alike developed, you need to read this book.  Now my hope is that the Democrats, who control both House and Senate, will read this book and try if they can to come to terms with a state of denial that has not been solely attributable to President Bush, but to our elected representatives as well.

My only disappointment in Woodward's book is that I would have liked to have seen included reports regarding how Halliburton contract money was used and directed in efforts to assist Iraq's damaged infrastructure
