Crystal is 16-year-old girl who has the begging stage of a modeling carrier, in her hometown New York. At first modeling is exciting for Crystal but soon it becomes less about her and more about her body/appearances. When her friend Rowena goes to the hospital over stress and trying to kill her self, Crystal realizes modeling is hard work and not fun and games. Especially when she has a big movie deal with the famous movie writer, Joe Sidney, he tries to get in her pants and make her do things she doesn't want to do, like change her name. Crystal also has the pressure to model from her mom, who could have been a model too but never through with her aspirations, and her dad, who wants Crystal to experience different things but also make a good living. 

This book had allot of different conflicts but the only thing that really irritated me was that they wouldn't say the problem was resolved or something else happened you would just have to keep reading and figure it in the next chapter, which was very frustrating but kept me reading! 

I thought this book was well written and had a very good plot line. When the plot line got stared it seemed like it would be predictable and the more you read it wouldn't go as predictable as you would think. I also think this was a good book because it showed a different side of modeling and its not all about the glamour and being famous. It made you think about the dark side of some models have to do. The only bad thing about the book was that the ending wasn't very interesting, it just basically wrapped of the book up and finished with a bad ending, I think the ending would have been okay if their was a sequel to Crystal that explained more about her decision and her life more.
