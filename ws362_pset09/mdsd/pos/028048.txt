Excellent. Saunders' satirical tongue is in full effect, as in his CivilWarLand In Bad Decline (a wavemaking machine eats a small boy while the protagonist watches and is upset that he'll have to clean up the mess.) A hilariously scathing indictment of corporate America, a la our fascination with amusement/theme parks, Pastoralia is worth picking up. Let the hilarity ensue.
