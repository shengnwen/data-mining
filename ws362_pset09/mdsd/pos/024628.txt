This novel through me for a loop at first.  I have never read a novel written in the second-person.  That actually drew me in, just trying to get use to that style.  This novel is a true classic and does a great job of being very descriptive while keeping the story flowing.  

This is a novel about testing the strength of man's character and integrity under trying circumstances.  The main character is the sheriff, the preacher, and the coroner.  Three jobs that give one a unique look at all different sides of events and life itself.  It accurately portrays the human struggle during our most desperate times.  Very good read. I highly recommend any student of English give it a go; you'll (a little second person pun) be glad you did!
