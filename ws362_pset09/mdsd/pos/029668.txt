i loved this book. it has all the elements i enjoy in an adult fantasy.
of course, if you want to fully enjoy this you really need to read book 1 and 2 of this trilogy. adventure,intrigue,humor, i found it all in this story. this was the first time i had read this author and i am anxious to read more of her books to see how they stack up to this one
