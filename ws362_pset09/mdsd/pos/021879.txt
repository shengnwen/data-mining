Blew through this one in a few days - highly entertaining, excellent read.  Fun fun book.  Such a great story and great characters.  This should be a movie but they'd probably screw it up.  It's a great read - sad to finish it really.  But glad to discover another writer I like.  Can't wait to see what else he's done and see if it's as good.  Or better!  Read this book it's GREAT
