Katie Mackey is one of those bright rainbow children; charismatic, brave and shiny at the age of 9, her disappearance shocks a small town in Indiana and reveals suspicions and social inequities in the foundation. Katie, on her bike, was returning library books and never came home. Her parents are the town's wealthiest couple, the objects of envy, and then of pity. In Martin's writing, you can capture how people felt the day of the disappearance; the smell, the feel, the taste of that day--in many ways the end of their innocence. 

Told from five points of view, the tale is unique in that Martin speaks with a clear and recognizable voice from each of his narrators, not just one style disguised in 5 characters. Martin draws us in, leaving us to question the motivation of each of the narrators; Katie's older brother, her tutor, a misfit couple where the wife was a widow who remarried too soon and her husband is a grifter who strikes an inharmonious chord in the small town. A third person narrator helps to stir the pot. 

Shame and sadness intermingle as each narrator asks the audience to have patience while the tale is drawn out. Finally, vengeance takes over, followed by emptiness. What the small town was becomes invisible and lost in what it has now become. Martin's elegant writing propels the tale, and first one, and then another conclusion is drawn. 

A short, compelling read; you'll remember "The Bright Forever" for a long time after you put the book down.
