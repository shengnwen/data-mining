This book explains how the world works, and in some cases how it doesn't work. Tons of topics are covered from free markets to the role of governments to international trade to the price of your health insurance to the stock market to the federal reserve and more.

It is written in a very entertaining and highly accessible way so that non-economic majors (like me) can easily grasp all the concepts. Many interesting real-world stories and examples are given that help you understand economic principles.

After reading this book, be prepared to change any negative views you may have about outsourcing, sweatshops, wal-mart, expensive prescription drugs, insurance companies, high gas prices, and much more. 

Understanding economics makes you appreciate more the standard of living we enjoy today and makes you complain less about life. You may not understand what I mean until after you read this book or similar books.

If you enjoy this book, you will probably like "Undercover Economist" which also does a good job covering many of the same topics but is a little more dense. If you were disappointed by "Freakonomics" because it didn't really delve into economic theory, then read "Naked"
