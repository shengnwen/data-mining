I own all of Dr. Wood's books.  In my opinion this is the best reference, while World Sourdoughs from Antiquity provides interesting historical information on sourdough baking.

I find the recipes quite adequate if one is familiar with making bread at home.  If one is new to bread making then I strongly suggest The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book and a loaf for learning contained therein first.  Get familiar with baking a yeasted bread before moving to sourdough.

Regardless, since one person's cup of flour weighs 4 ounces and another's 5 ounces I personally prefer recipes by weight. Thus, the volume measurement in Dr. Wood's book versus weight is less desirable for me personally.

I have two cultures from Sourdoughs International -- the original San Francisco and the Russian. I recently activated the Russian as well as a control of flour and water.  Both the Russian and the control activated within 24 hours and both had the aroma of a restaurant dumpster in the hot, summer sun.  

Following Dr. Wood's directions in this book I washed both the Russian culture and the control.  The Russian revived nicely and over the course several successive washings developed into a fragrant, active starter.  However, the control did not.
