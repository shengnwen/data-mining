  The scope of this work is astounding. In particular Keegan's coverage of the Russian front. One can almost envision 3,000,000 German soldiers stepping off the line in June 1941 to invade the Soviet Union. The brilliance of their initial attack combined with the arrogance and inhuman brutality which ultimately doomed it is set forth in astounding detail. There are some ommissions.  Iwo Jima is not covered at all. The massacres of Jews Poles and Slavs are not fleshed out but the strategic and geopolitical analysis is dead on.  The book was published before the ultimate epilogue to the war, the collapse of the Soviet Union, had taken place but the major personalities are all there as well as descriptions of the courage and suffering of the common soldier. To restate the old cliche if you can only read one book about WWII this should be it
