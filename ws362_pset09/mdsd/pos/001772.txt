In Fast Women, Nell Dysart, a recently divorced 40-something, starts a new life as the office manager of a detective agency in the German Village section of Columbus, Ohio.  She is an master of organization, style and bossiness, but she's met her match (and her soul mate) with senior partner Gabe McKenna.  The book winds it's way though family and business troubles with a strong supporting cast of characters, some laugh out loud dog stories, and some chilling suspense.  
I generally do the audio versions of books, but ended up reading the paper version of this one.  I wasn't thrilled with the audio reader's voice, which made all of the men sound like angry guys from the 50s and the women sound like they were 50.  The book in paper version, however, was a great Crusie read
