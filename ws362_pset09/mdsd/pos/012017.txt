A classic, no doubt, but still a chore to get through.  If Mr. Trollope were to write this book today, it would be half as long.  I loved the insights into a long ago set of values, and there were many instances when his wry humour moved me to laughter, but this is a tedious read.  I confes I &quot;power read&quot; parts of it.  I'm glad I have read Trollope, but I doubt that I will read more of him
