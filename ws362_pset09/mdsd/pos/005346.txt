Like one of the other reviewers I did not realize that this book was a sequel.  After reading such a fun read like THEN COMES MARRIAGE I am now reading its prequel, FIRST COMES LOVE which is just as great.  The characters in this book were well-written and I loved the secondary ones as much as the primary ones.  Some of the scenes are laugh-aloud funny, i.e. the pumpkin patch scene.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading all of Ms. Ridgway's books
