I read 'Do Me, Do My Roots' a while back and I didn't particularly like it. It was a great book to read to pass time. I read this book description and had to buy it. Just by reading the back of the book I knew I'd love it! I was right. This is a funny book with serious issues. Rendahl does a great job in balancing the two.

I recommend this to any of her fans or chick lit fans.
Looking forward to more books from her
