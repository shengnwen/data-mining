This was my first venture into the literary world of Edith Wharton.  Somehow I managed to pass her by in high school and college and thought it was about time to right this wrong.  
	
In her writing, Edith Wharton is both poetic and pithy, piercing and languid, frivolous and heartbreaking.  In essence, it is a flat-out stunning piece of work.  The story, however, is hard (emotionally hard) to get through.  The protagonist, Lily Bart, is deeply complex.  Her astonishing beauty, natural grace, and wit have fixed her as the shining ornament of New York's most exclusive social set. Yet she has no family money and must rely on the condescension of her social friends; a role that does not wear well on her independent nature.  
	
Although she is a lover of luxury and the ease that wealth permits, Lily was not born with social fangs or a proclivity to self-advancement.  This cruel and irreconcilable contradiction is one that wears on her throughout the entire novel. She is a complacent, yet sympathetically honorable, heroine who is difficult to fully love and understand.
	
House of Mirth is a book of wisdom and even, perhaps, redemption. Although I'm sure some literary critics would take me to task for that statement.  I recommend it as a book that deepens our understanding of this world and the enigmatic people who inhabit it.
