This has to be the 2nd coolest book in the universe, trailing shortly behind the zombie survival guide. It proved to me that there is more to life then surviving the hordes of undead. It's awesome to the max. and when I say to the max, I mean awesome. thats how awesome this is.

--TRUE STORY!!!!--

I was reading this book, and I realized that I was acctuly a ninja. I flipped out and chopped three people in half by wailing on my expensive and totally sweet guitar. Then I saw Chuck Norris, and I realized that I was totally more awesome then he is. we're friends now, and I should be getting out of the body cast soon. 

If you think that this book is stupid, you should grow a 8=D, cuz you obviously don't have one, loser-fac
