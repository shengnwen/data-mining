In this biography of Caesar, Goldsworthy has done a wonderful job of illuminating the political climate of the late Roman Republic.  The book was carefully researched and comprehensive, but not tied down by obscure technical details that would only interest a classicist.  Goldsworthy's narrative is fast moving and yet detailed enough so the reader can fully appreciate the context of Caesar's political and military strategy.  

I would agree with the comment above about the Epilogue.  I think the author missed an opportunity to sum up Caesar's amazing political and military achievements and show how his life had influenced other leaders throughout history.  He doesn't effectively say what he believes Caesar's life and story mean for us today.

Overall, this was an interesting and entertaining history of an amazing man and the author does a wonderful job of conveying Caesar's ambition, energy, wit and charm.  He certainly was a colussus living in fascinating times.  I would recommend this to people interested in general political and military history.
