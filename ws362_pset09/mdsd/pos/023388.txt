For most long-time LeCarre fans, the question is not "should I buy this one" but rather how does it rate with his other works.  Happily, this continues his strong recent showing and return to form in "The Constant Gardener" and "Absolute Friends."  While "The Constant Gardener" had a compelling plot and "Absolute Friends" was perhaps stronger on characterization, "The Mission Song" manages to do well in both categories.  Although both "Gardener" and "Friends" had their critics, I found LeCarre's new-found political commitments providing a logical and compelling direction for his fiction in the post-Cold-War era. Not all readers will agree, of course, depending probably largely on their own political views, but there seemed to be a loss of direction in the middle works such as "The Little Drummer Girl" and "Russia House." But it seems as if the current rancid state of world affairs, brought about largely by the lunatics in charge of this country and their UK facilitators, has energized LeCarre and prompted some of his best novels since the early classics.
Without divulging any essential plot, "The Mission Song" concerns a young African translator living in London who is recruited for a job that, it soon becomes clear, is much more than his government has represented it to be. Most of the action takes place at a secret conference on a North Sea island, which is so skillfully rendered that the suspense is kept up throughout, not an easy feat.  A good book to read, perhaps before this, is Adam Roberts' recent "The Wonga Coup" about a hare-brained attempt by various British mercenaries to take over the oil-rich country of Equitorial Guinea.  Perhaps "Mission Song" may have been modeled on that episode. I would like to see LeCarre take on the Iraq debacle next; I'm sure he would have enough material for several books there. As for 'Mission Song",  it deserves to rank just below the "Quest for Karla" trilogy and even the wonderful "A Perfect Spy."
