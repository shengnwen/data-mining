Having grown up in Los Angeles, I remember the fun of riding the red electric street car as a small child over 60 years ago.  I watched as the system was replaced by a maze of freeways and the concomittant development, changing a great landscape into what has become known as Californication. After reading this book, now I know how and why it happened.  Black writes convincingly of the greed that has dictated public energy policy over the past 100 years and brought us to our present sorry state of affairs with pollution, global warming, and oil dependency.  While some of the conspiracy implications may not be proven in this book, there is no denying the consequences of our energy history.  I found the book a thoughtful, well researched and well written presentation of this history.  It was an enjoyable if disturbing read
