It seems professors use these questions alot and they helped stimulate my interest in the material I had already learned. However, it is not a "review" as titled, in other words, the book does not methodicaly review or teach you indiviual concepts covered in the course.  An EXCELLENT choice for that purpose is the "pocket" version of this textbook by the same offer.  That really helped me learn pretty thourougly and fast
