I just finished Brigadoom (great title by the way).  I enjoyed the book immensely.  Susan Goodwill has set the stage for hilarious follow ups with her wacky cast of characters.  

Kate London is a real estate agent and owner of a local theatre that has seen much better days.  With her eccentric, old Hollywood actress Aunt and various friends, Kate sets out to solve the murder of her fiance before she is arrested for the murder. 

This lighthearted book will hold your interest and make you chuckle.  My only complaint is that the next book does not come out until March 2008!
