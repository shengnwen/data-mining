This collection is fairly extensive, with several books, all of which are pretty long compared to stories in other collections. What my toddler loves most are the illustrations, especially the early 1950s style of "Baby Dear."

Each story is presented as a separate book, making for easy breaks in reading. The only complaint I have about the collection is that it is almost too heavy for young children to carry around and read on their own. Unfortunately some of these books are not available on their own and if you want a copy, this is a nice way to have one.

Contents are: 
The Poky Little Puppy
Baby Dear
The Color Kittens
Good Night Little Bear
The Wonderful House
The Friendly Book
The Three Bears
The Sailor Dog
The Boy and the Tigers
I Can Fly
The Sleepy Book
How The Turtle Got Its Shel
