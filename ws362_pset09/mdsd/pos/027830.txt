In our present, complex times, when the word "terrorism" flows so often from people's mouths, a novel such as Harbor becomes an important, even necessary read.

Utterly ironic, this is the story of Aziz, a young Algerian who arrives to Boston harbor as a stowaway on a tanker. Starved and wounded in more ways than one, Aziz soon becomes part of a group of immigrants who, like him, speak no real English, lack a legal identity, and suffer from estrangement.  However, in spite of these binding factors, all are individuals with distinct behaviours and sense of morality. Aziz's relationship with some of these "brothers" ultimately lead to disaster. Thus, in his attempt to escape the terrorism he left behind in his homeland, Aziz unexpectedly ends up falling into its grasp once again, this time in the Land of the Free. 

Aziz is a sympathetic and tragic character, a kind-hearted soul who is a victim of these dangerous times, and proof that terrorists are not born, but made. 

The novel deals with themes of prejudice and twisted justice, and looks into the minds of "terrorists"--their routinely, day to day, sometimes petty situations. It also looks into the "mind" of the FBI and other security and intelligence agencies.

Many readers will find in Harbor an outstanding first novel, sparkling with crisp dialogue and a fast-paced, original style. However, this is not a regular "thriller," and the Arab names of the characters can get confusing at times. Ultimately, it is a disturbing work with an important message: One must never generalize, but look at the individual. If only for this reason, people should read this book.
