Baron's purpose for writing this book consists of informing the audience of how language came about, how it has changed as new technologies came around, and how it is still changing.  First she talks about where the written language first came from, and then she gets more specific and discusses how English evolved.  Next she covers who reads and why they read throughout the timeline.  She also talks about written standards and how language is exchanged over distance and time.  She also has a whole section that is devoted to email.  This book is well written with language that is easily understandable.  It is interesting with good example and explanations throughout.  It is more of a slower reading book to be able to soak up the information
