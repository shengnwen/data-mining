My lengthy review for Masterson's mainstream doppleganger version of this book, The Search for the Real Self, applies equally well to this version; you really only need to read one, and which you read is entirely up to what you want to get out of it. People who complained of the academic tone of the other book should steer very much clear of this one (which shouldn't be hard, considering the price)

Parts of The Search for the Real Self are actually re-edited and reconfigured versions of long passages from this one, and much of the content in that book is in fact phrased more concisely and accessibly, so unless you're seeking this out for more academically motivated reasons, I definitely have to recommend you go for the other book.

On the other hand, this book does a much better job of conveying Masterson's actual theory and the nuance of his therapeutic approach, which is why I've given it a higher score. If his concept of a "real self" as gleaned from The Search for the Real Self leaves your postmodern noggin skeptical, give this one a harder look -- there's nuance described here lacking in the other that is really rather interesting. All the problems mentioned in my other review still hold for this one, but there's considerably less culturally-loaded hand-holding to wade through before one can deal with the actual mechanisms in question.

On more thing worth mentioning  -- there's a chapter on Japan in this one that I don't believe Masterson has published anywhere else, and though it's embarrassingly ethnocentric and naive from any sort of serious anthropological perspective, you might find the scope and peculiarity of its interpretation to be quite interesting
