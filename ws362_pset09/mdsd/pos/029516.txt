After reading most of the "mixed" reviews, I was curious to read this book.  I was not disappointed.  I found the general plot to be very romantic, if not a bit protracted.  At times, I found Whitney to be infuriating and Clay overbearing.  Moreover, you can't help but root for this couple, as they encounter twists & turns everywhere.

I gave this book 4 stars primarily because it could've been trimmed down and plot tighted (e.g. stop with the horrible misunderstandings already). But overall, it's a thoroughly enjoyable book
