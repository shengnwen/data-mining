This book is really good in the beginning, but it's weak at the end.  It is a good book, but the chapters lack order.  It has some humor, and we learned a lot about wild animals.  She uses complex words, but she includes context clues so we were able to figure out what they mean.  We recommend this book for fourth through seventh graders and adults who love animals
