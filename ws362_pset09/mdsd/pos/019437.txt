When Cornelia is in ninth grade, her mother leaves her with her Great-Aunt Agatha and takes off with her boyfriend. Cornelia and Agatha are vastly different, with the teenager being a shy bookworm with a stutter and the older woman being a very folksy, country lady. Though it is blood that binds them, it is ultimately literacy that bonds them.  

This book is short and sweet, poignant and poetic. It is easy enough for reluctant readers and important enough to discuss with kids and adults alike. As mentioned earlier, it encourages and emphasizes the importance of literacy. 

Highly recommended. Well-written characters and powerful themes
