I first heard about this book from the introduction to &quot;Kitchen Confidential,&quot; where the author Anthony Bourdain compared it to Orwell's &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London.&quot;  He was right.  It's hard to find but worth the wait.  This story of &quot;The Falls,&quot; a hip New York City hangout in the early 1990's, is a wonderful portrait of the backstage world of restaurants -- the fish-crazy chef, the owner who doubles as a NYC fireman, the celebrity backers like Matt Dillon, the supermodels who got free steaks, it's all there and very, very funny.  Anyone who loves restaurants or good writing will love this perfectly-titled book
