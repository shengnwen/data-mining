I first read this book in my English class as a 6th grader.  The story is easy for kids to read, yet it doesn't seem like the "young adult" literature they often give to Middle School students.
The story begins in Germany in the mid-1920's; the narrator is a German Christian and his buddy Friedrich is a German Jew. The narrator's family is poor and Friedrich's family is well-off, yet they are never selfish or vain. As the years pass it seems like their community is getting hostile toward Jewish people, and while the narrator doesn't seem to understand what's happening, it looks like his Jewish friend is probably more aware. Friedrich gets blamed for all sorts of things, and while they try to do the stuff kids do (see the chapters "The Ball" and "The Pool") he finds that Friedrich is seen more and more as an intruder than a customer.
The last few chapters are more and more unpleasnat, the ending of which I will not reveal.
