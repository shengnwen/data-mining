for the longest, i thought faulkner was a bigot. but after reading " light in august," i've changed my stance. maybe he wasn't racist, but he was indifferent about racial issues, which is in some ways,  even worse because it shows you don't hold a position. but then again, artists are not expected to save the world; they are not obligated to be politicians or have political views. they don't have to. the artist's only job is to create. he wrote this book in 1930, when a black man merely looking at a white woman the wrong way got him lynched...when black men went to such extremes as crossing to the other side of the street, so a white woman can have the sidewalk to herself... that's how bad it was...it's probably easier now to have an interracial relationship in the south than it was 70 years ago...you'll always have your idiots, but some people just don't care. i would even be bold to say that if blacks and whites in the south don't date each other, it's because they reject each other due to status, financial or intellectual criteria, not color...in most cosmopolitan, southern cities,  you could do it...(for some weird reason, floridians don't consider themselves southerners...)

reading faulkner requires a high level of commitment, like marquez or morrison,like a high-maintenance woman, he wants your complete attention; no reading other books. but i had no problem with this one. faulkner wrote poetry and his prose is lush and surreal, with definite strains of stream of consciousness...he was influenced by a lot of french writers like flaubert and proust ( not one to take to the beach!...) and their dna is all over his work...i have also read "sanctuary," the only faulkner novel not set in yokanapatawa county...it's set in memphis....and "intruder in the dust..." you cannot take a southern literature course in a southern college and not read faulkner...i have a better appreciation for his work and him...
