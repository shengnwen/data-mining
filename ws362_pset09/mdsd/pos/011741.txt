After such a long time our favorite Dragonlance characters, Tanis, Flint, Caramon, Raistlin and Tas have returned in a new tale explaining how the Hammer of Kharas was found.  I have always enjoyed the Dragonlance books that dealt more closely with Flint and the dwarves and their mountain home, and Dragons of the Dwarven Depths definitely delivers in that area.  I thought the book was great and very much enjoyed reading it, although the editing was absolutely horrible.  Like a few others have already mentioned there are quite a few misplaced words and others are just simply left out all together.  I was very disappointed in this as it was not what I expected or remembered from previous Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman books.  Regardless, if you can get past the editorial shortcomings, Dragons of the Dwarven Depths is a very entertaining book and the first volume in The Lost Chronicles trilogy.  I am looking forward to reading the next two books (although having to wait a full year for the next book to come out is a real bummer) and I'm really hoping the editing is much better on the two following releases.
