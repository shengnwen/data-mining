If Les and Leslie were put on this Earth to teach, mentor and impart relationship truths...they have done an excellent job with this book!  I honestly felt as if they had been ease dropping on every relationship that  I have had. I wished that i'd read this book a lot sooner... it would have  saved me a lot of heartache, money, and time I spent making a fool of my  self with broken relationships.  Open this book and save yourself a lot of  sleepless nights while looking forward to more meaningful relationships
