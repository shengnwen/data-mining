I dare say that Robert Fisk has seen modern war up close in all its ugly forms more than any soldier and certainly more than any of the leaders who cause these wars. And he has come to loathe what he has seen and have contempt for those who bring about these horrors and sympathy for the innocent who suffer the results. The book is difficult to read because of the details of the horrors and the betrayals of innocence and the record of man's inhumanity to his fellow man. Contrary to what some say he does have some heroes and they are the little people, the soldiers who showed humanity under difficult circumstances and civilians who did not lose their humanity. Anyone who has a romantic or patriotic view of war should read this book
