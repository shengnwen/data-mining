The treatments in your new book are fantastic! How on earth are you able to come up with such a large amount of photos that don't seem to repeat everything else out there? And I don't see a lot of treatments made from the same old patterns either. Bravo! Thank so much for a book that I can show to my clients without apology for outdated photos or chintzy styles. 
Your photos are of quality treatments suitable for the best of homes!
