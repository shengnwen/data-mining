Judith Ortiz Cofer's book, Silent Dancing,  is an intriguing personal narrative, which creates an instant curiousity within the reader!  The structure of this book is creative in that Cofer writes each chapter as a  different phase/aspect of her life and creates a desire, for the reader, to  read on.  Cofer writes of her childhood and specific memories she holds of  her family and herself.  Her shared memorites of childhood allow her book  to be well understood and allow her readers to relate to their own personal  childhoods.  In addition, Cofer's shared memories of her life in Puerto  Rico and the emphasis on her family's culture had on her life,  is very  insightful.  She opens a wide window into the Puerto Rican culture and  allows her readers to see her life as it truly was.       This book,  although well written and very interesting, should not be considered for  young readers.  The main reason this book should be read by an adult  audience is because of some specific content within the book.  Questionable  references to sex and other material including the use of one profanity  makes this book one for adults.     Overall, this book is extremely  interesting in nature and one which should be read in enjoyment.  This book  offers  great insight into the Puerto Rican culture and allows readers to  be reminded of the many different cultures which make up the American  culture
