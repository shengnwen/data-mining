I recently applied to be a Peace Corps volunteer and naturally wanted to learn of some personal experiences.  I purchased several personal memoirs from returned volunteers.  I have read both this novel and &quot;The Ponds of Kalambayi&quot; by Mike Tidwell.  They are both excellent resources for anyone interested in the Peace Corps...or even anyone just interested in learning about different cultures.  I really enjoyed reading both of these books.  They are very well-written
