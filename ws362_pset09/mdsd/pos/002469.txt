Yes, I'm one of those baby-boomers contemplating moving into the "third-age" - when the kids have left the nest, the mortgage is paid off, the college accounts have been funded, the husband is semi-retired, but I'm still working, contributing the max to the 401K, and starting to wonder "what next"? No more ladders to climb career-wise, finally the time to think about pursuing hobbies, traveling and the freedom to "re-invent" myself. But, as what? I still haven't figured that out, but I'm sure it will evolve over time. The answers weren't laid out in the book, however, it definitely gave food for thought, and it is a good starting place for those contemplating such a life passage.

Much of the content of Dychtwald's book validated what I already knew about the "third-age" - we'll be living longer and healthier, we'll have new freedoms, we'll have clout in the marketplace (as members of the largest population bubble - the boomers), we'll be open to change, we can't depend on Social Security, etc. Some of the chapters gave me something to look forward to "See, Feel, Taste and Touch the World", "Lifelong Learning Adventures". The chapter on "Achieving Financial Freedom" wasn't particularly helpful, but maybe that's because I've already spent a considerable amount of time researching and considering that topic already. 

If you're entering your "Power Years", hoping to rediscover life's purposes, find a balance between work and leisure, find new interests, leave a legacy or any of the latent desires and wishes we hold for our later years, the book is a good primer, will provide plenty of food for thought and ideas, and will kick-start your journey into the "power years".
