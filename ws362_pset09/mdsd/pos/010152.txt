An interesting novel.

I picked up this book really by chance at one of the local book stores; the cover really intrigued me. Several good reviews on the inside  made me decide to purchase this little work by Iain Pears. I'm very glad I did. 

This is a story about vengeance and it involves storytelling with a difference. The entire book (all 211 pages of it) is composed of a single monologue by the narrator of the story, (an artist [painter] by the name of Henry MacAlpine). There is not a single direct comment (although there are some quotes) from another personage within the frame work of this tale. This technique works very well in this particular story as MacAlpine proceeds to lay bare his soul,  with introspective thoughts on his mediocrity and his flagrant shortcomings (both as a painter and a human being), while all the time, plotting  against his prey.  

Reading this book is akin to peeling an onion; each layer removed gets you closer to the heart of the matter; the problem being, that as you get closer to the center, one begins to have an uneasy feeling the that "heart" might just be quite rotten. 

This was a story that captivated me from the beginning, with its unique locale and its eerie atmosphere.  Although I sensed the "type" of conclusion to come, the last 10-12 pages totally caught me off guard. There are not many tales that I go back  and reread certain passages (to see if I missed the obvious), but I did, on several occasions with this book.

All in all, a great story; beautifully told with pace, timing and atmosphere. Highly recommended!  5 Stars (more if I could
