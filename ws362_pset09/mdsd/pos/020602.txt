  Bought this as a resource for an upcoming work of fiction and found it gave excellent insight into the lives of pirates. From their beginnings to what made them tick, it chronicles the lives of the more notorious ones and delves into their social life and the structure of their society. There's no such thing as buried treasure or so the book tells you.
  If you are interested in pirates and thier history, you will assurely find this book useful and informative
