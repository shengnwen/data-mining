In one book, you can see through Kahn's famous works, like Salk Institute of Biography Reaserch and Yale Center for British Art. Nice photos and descriptions. This book can be the beginning step for approaching Kahn's  philosophy of architecture.  He say, &quot;Existence will determines the  every nature of things&quot;. He used the simple forms to establish a  fine-art-class architecture style. Kahn's works could be said as  &quot;Simple in FORM, but not simple in MIND.&quot
