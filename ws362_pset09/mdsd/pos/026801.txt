Since this is a text book for me who is taking culinary classes at a local College, I am not really qualified except that I have worked with food for the past 6 years and love anything that will improve my cooking skills.  This book has given me enough information into the science of how and why we do what we do in cooking. It is interesting reading, full of good information and the workbook is a must if taking classes. The only thing I can say negative about the book, is that it's not bedtime reading.  Since I do drag it to bed with me and read for hours, I'm always looking for new positions to get into the make it more comfortable
