I had tried reading the bible years ago but always got lost with the strange language. It was a chore to read and I never did get through it. This book is so easy to read that I really enjoy reading it this time around. I ordered the large print which helps my eyes but that made the  book too big to carry around. I keep it in my living room as a reference book. My only complaint is that the pages are too thin and stick together. You need to be careful when you turn the pages or they'll rip. I suppose if the paper was thicker the book would be even bigger so that's probably why they made it like that. Basically, the book delivers what I wanted...an easy to read version of the Good Book
