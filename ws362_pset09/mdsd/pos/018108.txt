I have used this book for years with couples who come to me to get married (I am a pastor). The book begins with several mythical expectations that many have of marriage - which lead to greater disappointment during marriage. It helps the couple understand the nature of true love - as passion, intimacy and commitment. Though the authors do not point it out, the Parrotts' triangular view of love parallels the New Testament description of love as eros (passion), philia (intimacy), and agape (commitment). 

Communication and conflict resolution are covered, including a chapter on gender differences. Finally, the authors gently approach spiritual life with a chapter on becoming soul-mates. 

Many couples who come to me to be married do not share my Christian world view. This book provides an introduction to some of the most important marriage skills from a Christian point of view, but without assuming knowledge or acceptance of the Bible. The discussion questions at the end of each chapter, help the couple talk about their reading and their relational skills with each other. I also recommend the companion workbooks.
