I bought the book as a gift for a cycling fan who has followed the Tour since the 1930s and while he was thrilled with the beautiful images and details, some critical years have been over looked. There is absolutely no coverage for the years 1935-1939 and the Maes brothers. Other riders and stories are missing as well. The book is good but maybe there are too many large pictures and too little text. If you're new to the Tour de France, it's a good starting point, but if you know the history of la Grande Boucle -- you'll find more meat elsewhere
