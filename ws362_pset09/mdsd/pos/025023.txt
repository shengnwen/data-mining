Although I don't appreciate war epics much, the fringe of the Easter uprising in Ireland is a stunning backdrop to what is essentially a coming of age story. 

A beautifully written heart breaking and tragic story of love between boys (and men) before the labels "homosexual" or "gay" pigeon-holed men's feelings for men, set against a palate of poverty and class restrictions.

A must read for serious readers.
