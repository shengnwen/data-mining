This was another good story by Ms Jerott.  In it you will meet some old friends from her previous story Absoulute Trouble, and some new friends as well.  This is a fast page turning story with witty dialogue, great sexual tension between the main characters, and an interesting topic for the background of the story. Set in one of my all time favorite places New Orleans Louisiana, you will get plenty of discriptive narration that helps set the scenes for the story. Those of you who have read this author before will not be let down, and for those of you who have not yet read a story by Ms Jerott/Albert are in for a treat
