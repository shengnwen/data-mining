Lust for Life has been and remains my favorite book. 

A fictional biography of Van Gogh, the great artist who 'cut his ear off', is not only well written, but a great motivator.

Stone's sensitive and entertaining of Van Gogh's life helps provide some anchors in a search for meaning. What is truly impressive is that Van Gogh, despite his near 'silver spoon' origins and strong family connections with the art World, persisted in doing his own thing. He used to starve, while using his allowance for canvas and paints. And that too without knowing that he will be one of the Masters. This belief in self was truly insane.

I am not courageous enough to follow such a path, nor have a comparable passion (or talent) to focus on. But this book helps in defining what life can be aimed at, and hence provides a meaning to life.
