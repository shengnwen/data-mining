I just loved Tamara Hayle.  But it seems she is the poorest PI I have ever read about.  She never has money for anything.  Anyway, Where Evil Sleeps was very good.  I got the book as a Christmas gift and once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  Just when I thought Tammy was going to find out that she was being set-up by those druggies, she had no clue what was going on.  As I read the part about her searching for the money with that stupid girl, I just knew that Tammy was going to figure out she was being set-up.  Basil Dupre is my man. He always seems to appear just in the nick of time to save Tammy's butt.  They really just ought to get together at least throughout one book.  Anyway, the book was really awesome.  I can't wait to read the next book.  It sounds familiar.  The beginning starts out with Tammy about to get car-jacked.  I swear the same thing happened to me just before Thanksgiving.  I was just as calm and collective as Tammy.  Then when it really hit me what had just happened, I almost collapsed.  The thief got away with my car, but I got it back within three days.  I could swear I knew the kid. Anyway, Valerie, you go girl.  Love your books, read all of them.  Keep up the good work!!!!
