Milestones is a highly readable, name-dropping autobiography that illuminates some of the life and thinking of the current pope.  Our church chose this for one of the selections of our book club.  We reviewed it just after Benedict XVI's controversial talk at the University of Regensburg, which we read in its entirety.  The consistency of the sentiment of that talk (advocating, basically, for a repudiation of violence in the practice of religion, and a dialogue with other religions and with science) with Benedict's early life is very clear.  He is an actor on the world's stage, but also an important religious leader, whose vision directly affects nearly a billion people and indirectly the entire world.  Important, easy-to-read and gentlemanly book
