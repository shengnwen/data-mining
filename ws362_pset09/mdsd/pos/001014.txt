Our little daughter is 4 and I got this Wee Sing a couple of weeks before Christmas for her.  We are STILL playing it on every single car ride mid-January and I don't foresee her allowing me to put it away any time soon!  She has her favorites and her VERY favorites and pretty close to which order they appear in!  She sings along at the top of her lungs.  The CD gives her confidence.  Mom loves it because it's wholesome and a mix of Christian and popular secular Christmas jingles and songs.
Mom personally prefers Wee Sing for Halloween a tad better as more of the songs were sung by children.  Wee Sing for Christmas has many more adult-sung songs, but still good as they are geared for children.  Over all:  win/win!!
