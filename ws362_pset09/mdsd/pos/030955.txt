I have to admitt, at times, I was shocked by the honesty of some of the pieces in this book.  The information shared was very personal but made the experience that much more personal and eye opening.  I found myself relating to women and men on issues I had never given much thought.  

I particularly enjoyed Jason Shultz's "Getting off on Feminism" and Naomi Wolf's "Brideland."  Interestingly, they both involve weddings--Shutlz deals with a feminist bachelor party and Wolf deals with the lure of weddings.  

Overall, it was a great book.  I highly recommend it.  Even if you wouldn't consider yourself a feminist, read it, and you may find out some interesting things about yourself.
