This whole series of books is fantastic. The reviews (usually a paragraph or so) are concise, insightful, and obviously written by people who have actually read and used the books with children. They're grouped according to reading level, and neatly cross-referenced by title, author, illustrator and topic, so you can quickly find what you need. In addition to the reviews (400 in this book alone) there is other useful information, like a complete list of Coretta Scott King Award titles and interesting web sites. Besides being a great (and inexpensive) reference book, it's also great fun to read
