I really enjoyed this book, although it wrongly displayed schizophrenia. Deborah is admitted into a mental hospital for schizophrenia. She goes into another world she calls Yr where she is frequently punished because she can do no right in Yr. She has her own name in Yr and a whole other language in her world. She is completely detached from everyone else. Deborah has family problems and we learn about her past and more about her mother and father. Deborah needs to find her own cure, which the hospital helps her start by setting her with a wonderful psychologist.The book has a deep plot and can be a little hard to follow at times, but the small struggles are worth it.
