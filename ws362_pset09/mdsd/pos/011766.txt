When I first received this book last Christmas I was unsure to whether I was going to like it or not. The plot seemed to be a little on the lame Sci-Fi side and I could see a "Winkle in Time" rip off on the horizon. However, after reading it I found myself impressed, not by the plot as so many others are, but by the author, what he revealed of himself in the text and the way that his mind works. 
The guy's brain works in the same way that mine does and that's rare. He gets an idea, builds on it and he doesn't give a damn if it fits a format or works in the context. He is also very analytical and funny. My favorite part of the story is when Naia starts reading Aldous' paper that had been written years before. The text is about four pages and it's a rant about different scenarios that can be played out by our subtlest alterations of our daily routines. It's brilliant. The way that the man writes is brilliant. I was, however slightly disappointed by the resolution of the main plot. I guess that everybody gets what they always wanted, but I kept thinking about how much more the author could have done with it. Overall it was a quick, enjoyable, thought provoking and fun read that I would suggest to any literature lover.
