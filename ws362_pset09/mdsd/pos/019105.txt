We wish we had known about and read Casa Yucatán, before we had our wonderful three-week vacation in the Yucatán, in August/September, 2002. If you're planning to go to the Yucatán, be sure to take Casa Yucatán with you. We discovered (and stayed at)three of the marvellous hacienda hotels: the Temozón, Santa Rosa and San José. Each one has unique architecture, adapted from its original use with panache and refined good taste. When we saw them in the book, it was like re-visiting them. Our appetite was whetted to try to see more of the beautifully-photographed and knowledgeably-described homes on our next visit. At the back of the book, there's a 4-page Travel Guide, filled with useful information. Mexican design is beautiful and probably no non-Mexicans know more about it than Karen and Joe, having dedicated decades to studying it seriously and having visited and photographed many outstanding examples for inclusion in their books. One place we'll be sure not to miss is Hacienda Petac, the restoration of which was just completed in December 2002. Karen and Joe are partners in that enterprise, the design center of which offers a showcase for Mexican antiques, architectural elements and decorative accents. Hacienda Petac also offers accomodations to guests. We would hope that some of the architects whose projects are featured in Casa Yucatán and whose names addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses are shown, might be willing to arrange with the owners for interested readers to visit their beautiful homes
