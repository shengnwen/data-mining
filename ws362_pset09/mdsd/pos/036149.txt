Dai Sijie's memoire is an informative and satisfying description of China in the shadow of the Cultural Revolution.  The works as a powerful indictment of Mao's destructive legacy.  At the same time, Sijie paints a beautiful and affectionate picture of his land and its people.

I was puzzled at first by conclusion of the romantic subplot involving the seamstress.  From a western perspective, she places altogether too much importance on the popular French literature with which she is wooed by her intellectual suitors.  My conclusion is that the author is using this storyline to emphasize how China's cultural vacuum actually left the country susceptible to the Western influences that Mao most wanted to suppress.
