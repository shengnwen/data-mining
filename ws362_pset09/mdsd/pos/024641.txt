"Son of a b----, there's a cold snap and I do this number where I leave all the faucets running because my house, and most houses out here on the West Coast, aren't 'real'--" 

Read that out loud. That's music. 

Thus starts the first story of *Cold Snap*, the second of Thom Jones's three (thus far) short story collections. Unlike many other writers who also write novels, Thom has made a name for himself as a writer of only short stories, and he's delved farther into that fine art than any other writer alive today. While many of his stories is his previous collection dealt with drug addicts, boxers, and Marines (and permutations thereof), this collection reaches further into humanity for characters, such as Australian models and American doctors. His stories are bright and spare, not lush, but always funny and disturbing. In "Way Down Deep in the Jungle," one is horrified at the situation of a doctor in the wilds of Africa, and yet one cannot help laughing at his drunken baboon, up a tree, throwing stuff at him.
