This is the second book I've read by Jennifer Coburn.
I was a little skeptical about this book but decided to give it a try since I liked another one of her books and I heard good things about this book. I'm glad I read it.

Basically this whole book is about Prudence who cheats on her husband Riley with Matt, the 'love of her life' from her college days. Matt proposes and she says yes. WAIT! She's still married to Riley. She gets this idea in her head to find a new woman to become Riley's wife so she wont leave him high and dry.

Any fan of Jennifer Coburn or anyone who likes reading chick lit, you'll enjoy this funny and odd tale of Prudence's life
