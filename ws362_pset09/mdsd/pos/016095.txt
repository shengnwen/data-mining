I just purchased Healthy Indian Cooking from amazon.com and already I'm impressed. I live in the city of Philadelphia where there are many wonderful Indian restaurants. I have several Indian cookbooks but this one has quickly become my favorite. The recipes I have tried so far are easy and just plain delicious.     Even though I did not have some of the ingredients on hand, I took the advice of Alamelu and Patricia and started having fun in the kitchen. I've made the lemon rice, masoor dal supreme, eggplant masala and chickpea and bell pepper poriyal. I found each dish to be fresh tasting and perfectly spiced. I can't wait  cook my way through this book! Many thanks to Alamelu Vairavan and Patricia Marquardt for writing such a wonderful cookbook.
