I really liked the first half of this book.  What happens to humanity and the motivations for leaving earth are haunting.  The fact that the ending leaves you hanging on what is real and whats not, including maybe even the first half was somewhat disappointing but it wasn't quite the typical ending either so I give it 4 stars instead of 3
