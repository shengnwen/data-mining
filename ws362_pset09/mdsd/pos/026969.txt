This healing book was also a real page-turner.  I found that the author's honesty and vulnerability was refreshing.  Although we all have our own stories, Ms. Roth writes about the feelings that accompany our stories and how these feelings are sometimes temporarily smothered in the warmth and comfort of food.  Of course, food can't cure emotional pain...only physical hunger.  Ms. Roth's book provides readers with hope that it's possible to heal old pain and put food in it's proper perspective
