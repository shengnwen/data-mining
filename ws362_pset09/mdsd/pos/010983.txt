Typically, I don't enjoy these "high-concept novels." This one I did. It's the story of Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, in a story set during the Trojan War-yet with modern sensibilities. Pyrrhus might put on his khaki pants or use a credit card, but they are, indeed, in ancient Greece.

The story is well-woven and keeps your interest. Unless you are used to high-concept novels, it will take a few pages to meld the new and the old as the author intended. But it comes across well. Pyrrhus becomes disillusioned with the constant stream of one-nighters, and when called upon (as prophesied) to conquer Troy, he gets involved in battle. Even if you know ancient Greek history, the outcome of the war in this book will surprise you. Of course, there's still the hot love scenes one would expect.

A great read, especially if you're looking for gay fiction that's different from the usual.
