Julia Cameron's no nonsense style and shared wisdom on the connection between art and the divine. This is a real woman with her own share of life's ups and downs. Not some guru mystic in the popcorn style spirituality of certain areas of New Age. Forget Marianne Williamson and all the slick over-polished LA style gurus and their mantras. Turn inward and hear what down-to-earth folks like Cameron have to say. Rather this is Cameron's perspective on what the Divine is and is not. And what it is ... is hard work. She likens the method at which lost souls pick up and abandon deep spiritual paths in a matter of months ... as a form of shopping for God. A very refreshing take on how God is a serious force to be reckoned with... and that there are no short cuts to being in the consciousness of spirit. Easy to read but deep and provoking as usual, vintage Julia Cameron
