I just received my Trutone leather ESV single column bible.  I love the size of the text, the space betw the lines and words.  I would have given this 5 stars if the margins had been another inch wider.  I had the journaling bible and really liked the margins but the text was really small and in paragraph format making it hard to find a certain bible verse quickly. This is a pretty good bible for inductive study and marking text, etc... I really do love this bible! d
