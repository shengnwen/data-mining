I have read the book thoroughly & found that this "Modern Bible of Kitchen" is for one who wants to excel in culinary techniques & should try to possess this scripture....I finished this book within a week i bought it & go through this book religiously on a daily basis as i myself would like to pursue a career in the Kitchen...
hats off to the authors n CIA of course for this marvellous publication...
Wish u good luck CIA,
