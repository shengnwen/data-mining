This book does exactly what it claims; it gives the reader the ability to firmly grasp distilling on a personal level. The only downside is the history chapter is a little bit choppy and some facts are questionable (which the author makes perfectly clear). I highly suggest this book for anyone interested in the hobby and pleasure of procuring fine corn whiskey
