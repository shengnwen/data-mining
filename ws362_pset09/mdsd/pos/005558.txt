This book was EXCELLENT. I had read two other books before this one, and was disappointed. Though they claimed to be good for grad apps, they were clearly geared toward undergraduate application essays. This book asks thought-provoking questions that help to bring to light relevant experiences and skills that you may have left out. It is great as far as taking you through the process of brainstorming, writing, and revising, but also explains how to write a good essay even if the deadline is looming. It was very good at helping me to organize my thoughts and feel like a good essay was just around the corner - which did wonders for calming my anxiety about the process. The examples in the book were also very helpful, and this is the first book I have seen that had sections dedicated to specific programs (medical, law, business, etc.) THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!
