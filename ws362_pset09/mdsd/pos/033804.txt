I could not put this book down. Robert Baer's life story in the CIA is compelling and fascinating. Its very eye opening in to the politics of the war on terror and how the politics and the bureaucracy is crippling the CIA and in turn, leaving America so incredibly vunerable to another terrorist attack. He is a straight shooter and a true patriot, and talks candidly about the current state of America's war on terror - and I gotta say, I don't feel safe. The government is clearly failing to protect America on every level and the incompetence of the government agencies charged with protecting America is staggering. However, Baer goes after both democrat and republican administrations equally, which is refreshing. I think it adds to his credibility. 
After reading this book I wanted to tell everyone to read it
