   As a person who spent 13 years of the cold war in Army Intel.- 6 in West Germany (there when the wall fell), this was like coming home again. Great novel, based on well researched history. Will read more from this writer in the future. Anyone who likes Clancy stuff should enjoy this. I listened to the unabridged audio version, read by "Scott Brick" who is outstanding with the different accents etc... Enjoy!!
