The quality of the books is superior! the images are so well done it is a pleasure just to look at them!!  The content is relevant and adequate for todlers.  The only thing I didn't like is that the books are too hard to handle for my 18 month old granddaughter! However, the hard bound books will take any abuse! Great books!!!!!
