The above partial quote is plagerized from Joes book as he quotes Charles Linderbergh comments about the 747 which in its entirety was " This is one of the great ones "
I'm a retired Boeing Engineer, and while never meeting or dealing with Joe since I was working in other areas [supersonic transport, etc ] I did hear and work in later years with several who did have personal knowledge.  Joe pretty much tells it like it WAS/IS. 

I especially  appreciated his efforts to avoid highly technical terms, and in few simple words explaining some of the basics of flight, powerplants, design criteria, safety concerns, etc.  In some ways, it could be considered ' high school' level courses on flight and design criteria- but without ' talking' down to the reader. 

It is an 'easy read' and does lift the curtain on a few, but not all the insider political games typical of Boeing and most other aerospace companies. [ I've also  worked at Rockwell and Ling Temco Vought ] 

Joe is definitely from the 'old school' as far as ethics and integrity, and his comments about serving on the Challenger Shuttle disaster commission   and the NASA attitude re safety and risk in the last chapter seem as if they were written this week [ June 16,2006- see news items about  safety concerns re the impending Shuttle flight in July 2006 ].   Hopefully, his comments and concerns will NOT be proven to be " deja vue all over AGAIN."

 In my opinion -  a keeper, and  readable from Junior high up.
