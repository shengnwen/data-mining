I really am enjoying the audio recording of this book, but the one thing that really bothers me is the repeated use of the n word, to the point that it seems a bit gratuitous. I understand that sometimes authors feel language that is offensive is warranted for a period or regional piece, but I think there is a fine line between creating a sense of believability and just plain overdoing it.
