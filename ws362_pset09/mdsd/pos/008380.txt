This is the best book solely devoted to 1031 exchanges that I've read.  The author explains how these exchanges work in a friendly, conversational style.  It reminds me of a pleasant discussion alongside of a fireplace.  Yet the author covers the subject comprehensively and answers all the questions you would normally think of -- and a couple you might not have thought of yet that are very important. I recommend this book with the highest praise.
