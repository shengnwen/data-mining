Out of his long experience Noel Tyl presents us with one of the most important astrological books about this technique. With a lot of case studies he shows us convincingly the power of solar arcs in the 4th harmonic (though his examples are full of semisquares and sesquisquares - and that's the 8th harmonic - so I think you're better off with the 8th H). According to Tyl midpoint pictures that contain the same planet/point on both sides of the equation are not valid. I do not agree with that, especially not with solar arcs and directions. I refer to the fabulous book 'Midpoint keys to chiron' by Chris Brooks where such combinatiosn are called 'explosions'. In his book Tyl also mentions the rulerships (without going much deeper and that's a pitty) and the tertiaries. I'm glad that Tyl has written his experience on midpoint pictures down in the 2nd appendix. His interpretations are a very welcome addition to Ebertin's Combinations of Stellar influences. It's a treasure
