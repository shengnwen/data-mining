Janet and Colin Bord are writers best know for the subject material of unsolved mysteries.  They have written numerous books on different subjects such as sea serpents, black dogs, ghosts, etc. In this volume they have  collected reports throughout North America of the elusive creature known as  the Sasquatch.  Neither of the authors are investigators, they are  reporting the available sightings on this subject.  Therefore, there is  some para-normal events mentioned in this book as they report what was told  by witnesses whether or not it's true is debatable.  However the bulk of  the information presented is based on the work of serious investigators  such as John Green, Rene Dahinden, Peter Byrne etc.  The books covers early  sightings up the time the book was published in the early 1980's.  At the  end of the book is a chronological listing of all the reported sights they  were able to amass.  This book is a valuable resource for the available  sightings up to about 1980-1982.  Since this book is out of print, it may  be difficult to find, however it is not impossible.  The book is well  written and enjoyable to read and an essential addition to the libarary of  those interested in this area of crytozoology
