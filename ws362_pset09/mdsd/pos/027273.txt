The non-fiction novel, The Miracle of St. Anthony writing by Adrian Wojnarowski is a compelling story about an inner-city basketball team led by a coach that is a legend.  When reading this, the reader finds himself not wanting to put the book down.
	In The Miracle of St. Anthony, the players face many problems both on the basketball court and in their own neighborhoods. Their tough love coach makes turns them from boys to men. When reading this book I was able to relate to the kids in some ways. Although I did not live in the inner- city, I play high school basketball and a lot of people throughout the country have played high school basketball, which is what makes this book so popular. This book would rate 9.5 on a scale of 1-10 because it keeps the reader interested and it can appeal to all types of people; both of the inner city and of the suburbs.
	This book was similar to the movie Coach Carter with Samuel Jackson. The reason these two works were close to the same is because in both of them inner city basketballs team both goes on to having great success. However, In Coach Carter the team it is based is about a small public school, while in The Miracle of St. Anthony, it is based out of a catholic school that is surviving by the skin of its teeth. In both of these works the teams coach stresses the importance of grades and achieving greatness on and off the basketball court.
	The Miracle of St. Anthony, is a relatively new book and was published in 2003 by Gotham Books and was written by Adrian Wojnarowski.  Wojnaroski's a sports writer for the record of New Jersey and ESPN.com. He lives in New Jersey with his wife and two kids.   
 	The novel, The Miracle of St. Anthony was a very good book. I would recommend this to anyone that I know. If you are looking for a good book that's easy to ready because its so interesting read this book.
