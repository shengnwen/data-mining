my friends and i all have read this book within the past month and are completely hooked on emily giffin.  this book is simply the best book about the complications of friendships and relationships that i have ever read.  i am not exaggerating when i say that every single possible emotion you would feel in the ups and downs of love are explored in this book.  i can't say enough how great a book this is.  you have to read it.  i immediately bought the rest of the books by this author and they were all great
