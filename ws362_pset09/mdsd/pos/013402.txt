As a lifetime Braves fan I may be a little biased, but as a lifetime baseball fan I think I can make a fair review. It seems like Schuerholz wanted to write a book about how to be a great leader in the business world, but he just could not stop talking about all the interesting behind the scenes baseball stories from his career as a general manager for the Kansas City Royals and the Atlanta Braves. 

These stories make this book a fun read for baseball fans. Schuerholz talks about the Glavine debacle, trading for Barry Bonds, stealing Maddux away from the Yankees, and trying to sign Arod among other things. This book is a must read for Braves fans, and a pretty good look into the life of a general manager for baseball fans.
