First off, this book is a huge improvement from the last Friday the 13th novel "Hell Lake."  This book has compelling characters and a plot that is both coherent and appropriate to the setting of novels and movies.  This book takes place directly after the events shown in the movie Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood and ends with a perfect lead into Friday the 13th - Jason Goes to Hell.  The story revolves around a pair of serial killers who believe they are killing immoral sinners, just as their hero Jason Vorhees.  The pair take-off on a cross country killing spree to meet their idol: mayhem ensues.  Jason is portrayed as a one tracked mind killing machine that will stop at nothing to engage his prey.  I think that out of all the Jason novels thus far, this author best captured the essence of the Jason Vorhees character.  My only gripe about this book is that the death toll rivals that of a small metropolitan community.  I lost count after 20 murders and I wasn't halfway through the book.  The deaths do get a bit excessive toward the end and I must admit I skimmed over a dozen or so deaths at the end.  The final confrontations are well played out and worth your time.  Enjoy
