Although many people might question whether everything in this novel is true or not, it states on the front that it is a memoir, therefore that is how I thought of it while reading.  As far as I am concerned, everything but the names and some situations ("to protect individuals") is the truth, and since I have not been to Tehran, I would not know any different.  I found this book captivating in most every way from the detailed descriptions of the "girls" in the book club to the references to other novels such as The Great Gatsby.  Although I have not read all of the books Nafisi referenced in her memoir, I still understood her story and appreciated her sharing the private (or public) moments with her readers.  I was shocked when I read about some of the laws that women (and men) must obide by in Iran, and this book sparked my interest regarding the stunning ways of the country enough from the very beginning to encourage me to look even further into the culture.  Being a secondary education English major, I would suggest this book to anyone from the age of 13 on, with hopes that he or she would read it, appreciate it, and try to gain some knowledge on a very different culture than our own while recognizing the everyday freedoms we take for granted on a daily basis.
