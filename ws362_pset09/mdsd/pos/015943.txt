This is truly the best book I have ever read.  I not only learned so much about my own body but also that of my mom, and what she is physically and emotionally going through.  I learned that other women can relate to some of my experiences and I no longer feel alone.  I have learned to honor and respect my body and the monthly changes that I go through, and to appreciate those changes. I am going to teach my daughter that having her period is not something to dread, but something to celebrate.  I plan to buy this book for my 18 year old niece and my mom
