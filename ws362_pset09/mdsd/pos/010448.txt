Like any good series, this one is ripening as I go through it and get to know the characters. These books can be a bit hard to read with all the naval lingo, but I really like the characters, the adventures, and all of the historical details. 

In that regard, what interested me about this book was the plotting. The plotting of most popular fiction is climactic--that is, a tightly constructed series of events driving on to an explosive conclusion. By contrast, O'Brian's plots are episodic--a sequence of episodes, some of which are woven together but others of which appear to stand in isolation from the others, at least in the course of a single book. But as you follow the two main characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, from book to book, these episodes build to produce an increasingly satisfying effect. Plot elements like battles, discoveries, secrets, betrayal, romance, &c. turn out to be building blocks for a much larger story about two men and how they change and evolve in their lives. 

What a complicated task O'Brian set for himself, and how wonderful that he had the talent to pull it off.
