This is an excellent and easy to read book about Lance Armstrongs life and struggle with cancer written in plan, easy to understand English. It tells how he battled back from a 3% chance of living to win the Tour de France bicycle race. I was unable to put this book down after starting to read it because its written in a very positive and uplifting way.  I feel as though I almost know the guy now
