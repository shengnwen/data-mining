Generally, I love the "in death" series, because of Eve and Roarke. I liked this book, but I thought it was so sad when Eve was suspended from duty and had to turn her weapon and badge. But she did not give up. She is a strong woman and I love strong women, because they show real women that they can be just as strong, yet vulnerable
