 In a word, YES!!

 Forget what you know from previous books by Shatner and Reeves (as I have, never having read any of them anyway) and have fun with this one (or both, again, as I have). This was a very fun experience to have read and, if they ever did sequels to them, will want to read again. I was absolutely astonished by how great the stories were.

 The Star Trek : Enterprise story picks up where the "In The Mirror, Darkly" episode left off and really let's it rip. The TOS story picks up where "Mirror, Mirror" let's up, as well, but also introduces characters from ALL 6 movies, in rather inventive ways (I offer NO spoilers, but keep an eye out for them, if you kept up with the movies). The TNG story seemed thrown together, but was still fun to read and introduced characters (again, in VERY inventive ways).

 It is well worth the read!!
