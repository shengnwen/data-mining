This is one of the best Masonic History books that I have bought. It is very easy to read, but, Very hard to put down. It has a heavy hardbound cover, and thick pages. It is a good coffee table book. It is chock full of both ancient and modern Masonic history. Lyn Emfinger, Central Lodge #70, Montevallo, Alabam
