Lacks the tragic inevitability of &quot;Dead Man in Deptford&quot;, but still a good read. Brilliant language, Elizabethan England nicely evoked, well-drawn characters, clever speculation to fill in the gaps in what we  know of Shakespeare's life. A bit crazy, especially at first, but that's  what you pay for with Burgess, right
