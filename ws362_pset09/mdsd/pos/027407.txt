This book is aimed not at the financial planner, but at the nonfinancial business executive or business student interested in understanding financial management. The only prerequisite for the book is a bit of familiarity with financial statements and a curiosity about the money side of the business. 

This book is now in its eighth edition. That alone is an indication of its success in meeting the needs of the marketplace. The eighth edition includes material on several of the new an innovative business practices such as the Dutch Auction for Google's initial public offering, why lenders were willing to lend Amazon $350 million just after they reported a loss of $146 million, Dell's breakthrough in working capital practices, Microsoft's cash position of almost $50 Billion. (Microsoft says they need this much cash for potential acquisitions - like maybe they decide to buy a small country). 

This particular edition of the book comes with access to the Educational Version of Standard & Poor's Market Insight on-line data resource so you can work with real data that is as current as can be obtained by anyone
