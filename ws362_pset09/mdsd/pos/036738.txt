While reading this book you get to share in the many personal experiences of Eleanor Roosevelt.  She does not focus much on her relationships, rather she focuses on sharing her experiences.  The places she has gone to and the people she has talked to are absolutley amazing.  She shares her firsthand experiences of the mine workers and her talks with people in communist Russia.  It is amazing that just one woman has seen and heard from so many varying perspectives.  She really did try to empathize with the people and situations around her and this really comes out in her book.  I think many people can learn from reading this book on how to be a better listener and observer and critical thinker of the life happening around you
