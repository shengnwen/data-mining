I read this book back in high school because I was intrigued by the title ("The Wanderer"). I enjoyed it at the time, and through the years I always remembered it as one that really resonated with my gloomy adolescent mind. 

Feeling nostalgic recently, I located a used copy and read it again, trying to recapture whatever it was that had engaged me so many years before. It was interesting to experience the same story from a more seasoned perspective in life. It was not as deep as it had once seemed to me in youth, and yet I noticed and understood many nuances and details that had been opaque to my teenage mind.  In a way this parallels the story in the novel.  Youth imagines what maturity never sees, and maturity knows what youth never imagined.

The edition I bought included a short biography of the author, who was killed in WWI - this was his only book. It was interesting that the story of the lost love was based on real events in Alain Fournier's short life. It is a glimpse into just one young life that was snuffed out by war, all future promise never to be revealed. As such, it is a story which is nearly as wistful and sad as the novel itself. Just as one wonders "what could have been" if Meaulnes got the girl, so we wonder what other novels Fournier might have gone on to write, had he not been buried beneath the sod of Europe.
