     I've just started studying Korean and this book, so I can't review it in depth.  I mostly wanted to pass on some info to fellow Korean students.  I will say that I was impressed enough to buy the 2nd volume which also includes a CD.  Yes, the CD contains fast speech, but stick with it.  You might only be able to repeat part of the phrase the first times through, but eventually you can catch up.  Pronunciation is the first threshhold to cross whenever starting another language.

     I live in the USA, but I ordered my copies from Amazon Canada.  You might wish to look it up there yourself.  As of this time they list a new edition coming out.  I saved a few bucks and also ordered Assimil Coreen.  If you can at least read French well, Assimil has a great course in Coreen (Korean) with tapes or CDs. (Check the Assimil site for ISBN numbers so you can order the version you prefer from Amazon--Amazon has all too brief descriptions, but does include ISBN).  Also check out The Sounds of Korean: A Pronunciation Guide--another great CD/book combination with in depth pronunciation exercises.  
For less than the cost of Pimsleur Comprehensive you can buy all 4 books.  You would then have nearly 5 hours of recorded Korean instead of Pimsleur's 15 hours of WAY too much recorded English and repetitious bits of Korean.  Plus, you would learn Hangul and have books full of info!
