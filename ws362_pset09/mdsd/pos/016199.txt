The House of the Scorpion is about the life of a clone named Matt. Matt is a clone of a 100+ year old man, also known as El Patron. Matt is made for extra parts; like is El Patron's kidney fails, Matt will give El Patron his kidney  to make El Patron practically immortal. 
My favorite part of the book was when Matt was imprisoned. I really liked it because his cell was filled with sawdust and he had a little city growing in the sawdust. Matt would save scraps from his meals and hide it in the dust. The food would attract critters and bugs, and Matt knew the city very well. It is also my favorite part because it was described very well.
I would recommend this book to any one, especially readers who like sci-fi. I recommend this because it was gave me a very clear picture in my mind of what was going on. Also, it was a page-turner. Furthermore, this book was some times ironic and funny. This book has a very good twist on sci-fi because it went into the world of the abnormal and sometimes disturbing thoughts that would hopefully never happen in the real world.
