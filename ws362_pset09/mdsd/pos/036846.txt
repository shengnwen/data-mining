simply the best book i have read covering the vietnam conflict whether it be american or french . It reads like a war novel at its best, the difference being this account is fact. The book covers the reasons why,the build up,the complacency and finally the tragedy . One cannot but marvel at the tenacity of both sides aswell as the strength to endure such hardships. Why the americans had the arrogance to think it would be any different for them is disturbing as parralels can again be seen between the vietnam conflict and the current war in iraq
