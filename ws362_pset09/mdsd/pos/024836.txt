This is a good field guide, in that it is relatively small and lightwieght, about the same size as Peterson and maybe a little better. I have no complaints, yet, as a small field guide, it needs to be used in conjunction with more complete, detailed (and much larger and heavier) reference (Howell & Webb as well as Sibley)
