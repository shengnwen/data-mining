This is the first Robert B. Parker novel I have read and I throughly enjoyed it. The main character is a private detective who is both intelligent and resourceful but has a pleasantly sarcastic/cheeky side. Parkers ability to tell a story without making it too detail-saturated and drawn out made for an enjoyable reading experience. I plan on picking up some more of his work and urge you to do the same
