Pirates! Pirates! Pirates! It's all about pirates this summer for the "under 10 years" jet-set, with the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie just released. I'm told by my resident "under 10 year old" that this is the book / toy set that pretty much covers "cool". The book is a full-color / picture-laden novelization of the movie, and it comes with the neatest picture viewer / telescope I've ever seen - remember those plastic binocular-like toys we used to have in the early 80s? This is just like those only it uses 10 "gold coin" -esque items that fit into a slot, hold up to the light, and rotate to view film images. Very sturdy too, this item looks like it's going to survive the usual summer usage-beating. 

Extend the telescope to check out ships in the horizon, or collapse and insert the numbered film 'coins' to read along with the story - and the book has prompts to correspond with each of the image 'doubloons' so a child can read along and easily find the correct image to look at. It is text heavy, so very young ones will need an adult, but it's a fun enough tale (spoilers in the story! be sure you see the movie if you mind!) and all kids are gonna love the toy. I'm actually starting to wonder if this is going to be incorporated into a Halloween costume this year. It is pretty neat, and I could look at Johnny Depp all day myself...

Great beach toy too! Dad and daughter seemed to really enjoy using the telescope as a kind of 'I Spy' game after reading the book together. No worries about little pieces either, the book serves as its own carrying case for all fun pirate bits. Telescope / Viewer snaps into top section, and 10 disk images fit snuggly into the side plastic holder - with or without the top clear plastic cover.
