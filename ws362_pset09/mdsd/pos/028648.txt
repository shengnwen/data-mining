I think the breadth of philosophy covered here was very nicely strung together.  Gaardner's explanations and examples are great--they clarify some esoterics.  

I feel I benefited from this book, because my curiousity has been piqued.  This may very well be why this book was written in the first place: To ignite readers' interest in philosophy.  That being said, I'm going to be checking out books written by or about a few key people mentioned, most notebly: Hume, Kant, Marx, Kierkegaard, and Hegel
