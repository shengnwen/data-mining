 This is the greatest book ever writen. I got hooked on Dumas reading The Count. I wanted more so I picked this up no thinking it could compare. I was wrong. This is everything a book should be. Action, Pain, Loyalty, Betrayal, Decete, I don't have enough words to explain it, just read it. I promise, it is amazing
