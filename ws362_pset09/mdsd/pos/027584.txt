I am in the group that's grown frustrated with the pace of Jordan's last 5 Wheel of Time books.  So, it was with some trepidation that I bought this book.  What a pleasant surprise; it was a pleasure read, the characters were well developed, and the plot was defined.  I was emotionally involved in the book through the last page.

At 330 pages, it's a short story by Jordan's standards.  The plotline was intricate, yet easy to follow.  More importantly, it was resolved at the end of the book.   Nonetheless, there are plenty of threads that leave room for Jordan to write prequel sequels. 

For anybody who's already read Jordan, I reccommend this book - you'll be satisfied.  If you're new to the WOT series, start at Volume One and read the first five or six books before you get back to this prequel.
