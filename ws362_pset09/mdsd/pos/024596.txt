A fair collection of John Lennon photos at a reasonable price. Text is kept to a minimum, altho' I felt some captions were a little too sparse: Many faces that remain anonymous here are identified in other existing Beatles tomes. A few more names wouldn't have hurt.

Most photos already appear many times over in the standard Beatles works, but some of John's youth are AFAIK new releases. What I appreciated was that the photographers themselves are given the opportunity to have their say. That I found informative.

I agree his murderer needn't have been honoured with an image. As long as Yoko has anything to do with it, we're unlikely to ever be endangered by him
