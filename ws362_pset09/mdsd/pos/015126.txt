Mr. Bowman has done an excellent job of explaining the inner workings of commercial investment real estate. This book is a must read for anyone interesting in succeeding commercial investment real estate. The book is very informative and well written, and the examples are well thought out.  One drawback would be perhaps the treatment of some of the topics was a little scant. That is probably as a result of the vast differences in the practice across the country. Still, the book is well written, easy to read and understand and I highly recommend it.
