yes its a good book, king henry sits in his castle fagging around, his brother d'anjou wants to be a king, because he's got nothing better to do all day long and has no playstation 2. bussy in love with somebody else's wife and wants to score so is her husband. chicot king's jester is so smart and perceptive that i think the writer of this book used chicot instead of his real name, bussy dies, because he won't give up monsoro's wife and monsoro is so h0rny and because of it very angry. oops i just read you entire boo
