What kid wouldn't love this book?  In my music classroom, half of the kids play the stair climbing sound effects on the xylophones, while the others take on the roles of Mortimer, Mortimer's father, mother, brothers and sisters, and police.  Lots of fun and I'll guarantee they'll understand the concepts of upward and downward melodic direction when you're done!  Plan to laugh a lot
