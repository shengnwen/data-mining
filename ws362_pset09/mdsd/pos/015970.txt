This is one of a series of books which features Dr.Alex Delaware, a young, handsome and wealthy psychologist. At a rather ritzy party, he meets Sharon, an incredibly beautiful young psychologist with whom he had a brief fling some years previously. Drawn to her despite many misgivings, he is caught up in a web of lies, deceit and intrigue which culminate in several gruesome murders. The plot involves a now deceased but sinister mega millionaire who is a direct copy of Howard Hughes, complete with matted beard, long, filthy fingernails and all of his unattractive anal retention habits. The story becomes more and more involved, using identical triplet sisters, mentally retarded carers and a Svengali like therapist who controls Sharon. At times I was muttering"hurry up and get on with it" but, in all, an entertaining read
