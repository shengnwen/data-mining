Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics. 

Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.

I would highly recommend this masterpiece
