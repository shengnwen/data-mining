Tolstoy really hit on the fact that people work their whole lives in pursuit of something that will make them truly happy. "The more I get the happier I'll be". It doesn't work like that. Even at his best he was miserable, suicidal. The answer is God. Plain and simple. He is the only thing that Tolstoy discovered would lead him to a more peaceful,satisfying life. This was a great book
