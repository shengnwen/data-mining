i really liked this book I had to write this report about the Greek Gods and Goddesses and this saved me from having to find alot of other books about the subject. It has all these stories about the differant gods and  goddesses. One of them about Artemis about Medusa and Zues and the Boy's  all time favorite Hades. I persinoly like Artemis or as the romans called  her Diana. I also dressed up as her for the feast of the gods. I would  recommend this book to anyone who likes the gods and goddesses,or has a  really important report coming u
