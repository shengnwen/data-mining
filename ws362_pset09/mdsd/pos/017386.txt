Do you like dogs?  Well I have read a book called Five True Dog Stories by Margaret Davidson. These stories are true, and great but can sometimes make you sad. This book is about 5 dogs, their names are Grip, Dox, Barry, Wolf and Balto. They're all dogs with different things to do. Some are trained to do bad things and some are trained to do good. My favorite part was when Barry goes to look for people stuck in the snow with the monks.  I'd recommend this book to anybody who loves dogs.         by : Yanni
