Despite producing some of the best novels, reporting, and essays of the past thirty or mopre years, Tom Wolfe remains underappreciated in literary circles- perhaps because he's never sought to be one of the insiders. His politics are his own, not dictated by the fashions of the New York Review of Books, and his writing owes more to the great novelists like Zola and Tolstoy than it does to the postmodern icons whose work seems to by the standard for literary merit these day.

And that's a pity, as few writers can compete with Wolfe when it comes to making important points about culture in a way that's so entertaining. Aphorisms seem to spill out of him like water from a tap. For instance, his reaction to the oft-heard threat that America is falling into some sort of opressive government: "Fascism is forever descending on America- but it always seems to land in Europe." 

This book contains a number of Wolfe's observations of the cultural scene, going back to a brilliant parody of The New Yorker and New Yorker editor William Shawn that appeared in Esquire around thirty years ago. All are showpieces for Wolfe's brilliant writing style and incisive wit. 

My favorite? Hard to decide between "Roccoco Marxists" (a discussion of the literary Marxism that lives on in academic and cultural circles) and "My Three Stooges", which combines Wolfe's serious  call for a return to the naturalistic novel with a hysterically funny description of the attacks visited upon him by three of America's supposed literary lions.

But really, it's impossible to pick out favorites; it's all very, very good. I enjoyed it so much I went out and found a few more used copies to give to friends whom I thought might appreciate it as well. If you like the sort of witty, thoughful writing that seems to have disappeared in the modern era, you might like it, too.
