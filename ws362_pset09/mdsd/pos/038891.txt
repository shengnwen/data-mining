Dobyns scatters his words throughout the material and the immaterial in this fine, fine collection.  His daughter's fate is pondered while shaving, all the dangers of her life worry him while she plays in the shaving cream.   Or he switches to a somewhat darker political awareness, due to his  extended stays in Chile.   Either way, Dobyns has a great colloquial style  that doesn't gyp you on content--you feel like you're reading a letter from  a friend, and then a stanza will just jump out at you--and you realize it's  a good, good poem
