A Day No Pigs Would Die is about a twelve year old boy named Rob who finds his neighbor's cow and helps it give birth. Rob's neighbor is grateful and gives Rob a baby pig in return. The book tells of their great adventures and their friendship, creating unforgettable, sad and happy moments.  Rob is a very determined and caring boy who is rather quiet. He works on the farm with his dad and learns what it takes to be a farmer.
	This story makes you feel incredibly emotional and sad the way Peck tells about what hard times he goes through.

	Although it is a very moving,  deep and fabulous book, the description of how he's feeling and what is around him is very brief.  People who enjoy leisurely and slow, sad books would enjoy this wonderfully weaved story.
