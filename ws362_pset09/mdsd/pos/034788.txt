D IS FOR DEADBEAT is an odd story - Kinsey is hired to give $ 25,000 to a fifteen-year-old. Should be simple, right? Not with Sue Grafton writing the book!!  When Kinsey's retainer check bounces things really start to get interesting!! Next Kinsey finds the deadbeat who wrote the check, he was dead. Now she has to find out who killed him in order to get paid!

This is the first Sue Grafton book that I read and I was hooked after reading it. It's exciting and keeps a fast pace so you're never in danger of becoming bored. The plot is well developed, as are the characters. We see more into the personalities that make up not only Kinsey, but Henry the landlord as well. If Kinsey were older or Henry younger, you might see some romantic sparks fly - but that's not in the future, only a deep friendship.

Grafton also starts expanding the supporting cast of characters with a glimpse at Rosie, the Hungarian diner owner down the street. The people Grafton writes about are all flamboyant in their own ways.

Definitely a great book to spend some time with, but make sure you have the next book (E IS FOR EVIDENCE) ready to pick up as soon as you read the last page of this one - you won't want to stop reading!
