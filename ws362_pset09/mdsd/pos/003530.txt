I'm not necessarily a big fan of Ludlum's novels and most of them are nothing special, but he sure hit a home run with this one. I read it when it first appeared -- having recently completed Le Carré's "Smiley" trilogy and concluded that no spy novel could ever match up to that masterpiece -- and became totally absorbed in the world and very short amnesiac life of Jason Bourne (a/k/a Delta, Cain, and several other pseudo-identities) as he tries to figure out just who he is, how he came by his highly specialized skills, what he's expected to do with them -- and just who is trying to kill him. And why. There's a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that's necessary here, especially in Bourne's relationship with Canadian Marie St. Jacques, who is very conveniently an economist, and also with the bitter French general who appears to do a one-eighty in an extremely short period of time. But I can live with that. Nor is the movie anything but the palest reflection of the novel. This is also not a book to race through in a weekend, not if you want to appreciate all the tangential complexities of the twisting plots, but it's worth the effort
