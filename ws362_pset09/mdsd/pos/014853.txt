Perhaps the most exciting publishing venture of the 21st century is the new Penguin/Viking translations of "In Search of Lost Time," as the book is now (and more accurately) titled. I have read the first two volumes in this series, and they are a wonderful improvement over the rather dusty prose of Scott Montcrief and his colleagues. I am betting that the new "The Guermantes Way" will match them. It's available in hardcover (the ISBN is 0670033170) and paperback (0143039229) from Amazon. The translator is Mark Trehane. Go for them! -- Dan For
