This book is a not un-biased account of the Old West massacre of over 120 men, women, and children by Mormon (and possibly Indian) citizens of early Utah Territory.  It was written by a Mormon with obvious Mormon sympathies, and that's okay. 
But it was also written a long time ago, and a lot of new information has since resurfaced.  I think if Juanita Brooks were alive today, with today's resources, she would write THE definitive work on this sad episode, and we could all be free to talk about things that we can actually do something about.
But, she's dead.
We do have her book though, and it is a good account of this incident--of this massacre.  It dwells a little too hopefully on the vague possibility that maybe the murdered wagon train provoked it (basing such notions on rumors), and it places too much blame on the Indians and not enough on the Mormons, but it's a good read, especially when paired with other more recent books on the subject.
