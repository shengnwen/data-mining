Trying to make George W. Bush happy with his No Child Left Behind, I decided to seek a highly qualified status in mathmatics.  This book was a refresher for me as I have to bone up on all aspects of mathamatics.  It is a very simplified and step by step overview of the 'meat' of calculus.  I wouldn't reccommend this if you wanted to get a very involved look at the subject material, but for an overview or refresher, this works admirably
