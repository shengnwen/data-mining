Reading Jack London's &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; is like attending an AA meeting almost 50 years before they were instituted.  London herein gives his story of life with alcohol, and it is much like those you hear in the  rooms.  Beginning with denial, then the drinking becomes a morning thing,  then on the sly, the progression is classic alcoholism.   Along the way,  London includes enough autobiographical information that this is more than  just a booze tale.  Interestingly, London -- a devout socialist --  constantly harps on the need for prohibition in this country as a way to  end the danger of alcoholism.  And we all know how that worked out.  I'm,  an alcoholic, so I appreciated the book on one level.  London is my  favorite author, and this is one of his good efforts.  It's not a  depressing tale but one that is uplifting.  I recommend it.(Review by Tom  Bruce
