I watched the original Silence of the Lambs some time ago and just today watched the Special Edition version which is awesome and am now finished with the book WOW! Hannibal is creepy!. One thing I find interesting is there isn't just a miraculous happy go lucky story here where the good people find ways to overcome all the odds. I really like that in a book the realism is great!.
