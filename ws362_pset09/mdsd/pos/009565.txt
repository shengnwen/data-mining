I haven't ever truly read a comic, save for those in the Sunday paper and that happens about once a year.  This book was handed to me by a friend and it was so unexpected and unconventional to tackle the subjects and human pain she does with her narration and illustrations.  She pairs them together well and while the tilte seems a little, well "evil" the sentiments and conclusions in this book are anything but.  I loved it
