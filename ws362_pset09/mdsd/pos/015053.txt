Model portfolio photography tends to be a seductive pursuit that attracts photographers who either lack the necessary experience, or shouldn't be doing it in the first place. Portfolios are properly shot by working fashion or product illustration photographers who understand the challenges.

Even so, it's difficult to resist the allure of photographing an attractive subject, and everyone has to start somewhere.  I recommend starting with this book.  It truly is a step-by-step guide that leads you through everything you need to know to help a model create his or her book.

If you're a veteran pro, you might find some ideas here, but will hardly need the education.  Beginners can do themselves -- and their subjects -- a service by reading this book thoroughly before attempting their first portfolio
