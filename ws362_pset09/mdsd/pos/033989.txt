My 12 month old loves the book & is keen to listen & look at the pictures every time I read it to him. It is fun reading it to him as well as I enjoy the reminders of my home in Australia. I am now living in America so it is a very good book to have. Mem Fox is the best & I love her style of writing - this has to be her best book ever
