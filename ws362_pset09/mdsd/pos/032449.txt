It is thirteen years since Kennedy wrote this book. I read it with the idea in mind of comparing his sense of what would be with what there is now. He misses so much, including the worldwide clash of civilizations in which radical Islam has launched a terror war against the West. He does not really focus on the whole 'Eurabia ' phenomenom though he does see how declining birth- rates in advanced countries may jeopardize their future. 
Demographically, he does not see how the 'population explosion' has turned into the 'birth dearth'. And he does not give real attention to the ' greying of mankind as a whole'. It is not simply the first world which will be facing these problems but China too will have a 'massive greying' in the years ahead. 
He too does not focus on many of the biotechnological changes which are raising questions about the fundamental meaning of our humanity. 
He does once again speak about the US' loss of manufacturing power, the deficit the likelihood of its decline. 
He does too warn about environmental problems which no doubt are serious and real. 
He is not to blame of course for not seeing some of the most important developments of the past thirteen years.. No one can y see the future which always offers surprises.
