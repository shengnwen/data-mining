I picked up this book a while ago second hand on a college campus because of my interest in tattoos as well as symbology (apologies to Willam DaFoe). The book has given me some ideas for new ink as well as clarified some misconceptions about ancient Christian symbology.

There were a few connections the author made that seemed to be stretching it, but I would absolutely recommend this book
