The book is a must-read for anyone who has a job in corporate America, without respect to the industry you're in. Eisner and the other characters bring real corporate intrigue to life, to which we can all relate. The games, the titles, the hirings and firings, the information sharing and hiding -- we can all relate to how this works in large brand corporations, and when it's exposed in the largest and most widely known brand, it's a riveting. Really a great read
