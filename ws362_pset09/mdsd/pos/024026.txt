I completely enjoyed this book because it managed to show the joys and sorrows and just plain hard work that it takes to become someone so successful in the world of entertainment. So many times you simply get a lurid expose or shoddy manipulation of facts to justify a preconceived idea by the author. In Gilvey's work I was allowed to discover the theater and the man, as we traveled through Mr. Champion's life. The book gave me information which allowed me to grow in appreciation of what it takes to even attempt to produce shows which look magical. When I see any well done production, I am made to feel as if what I am seeing is effortless. I am transported into the world of dancing, singing or feeling with the actors on stage. This behind the lights history reveals the price of that art. It shows the real work of real people, without being overly technical. Consequently anyone can understand and appreciate Mr. Champion's life, and the struggle it takes to put on the magic we so deliciously take for granted as we leave the theater. Kudos to Gilvey for being able to share his love of the theater through the life's journey of an artist who could do it all. This biography illuminates the man and reveals the heart and soul of the artist. A must read for anyone who is contemplating entering the theater
