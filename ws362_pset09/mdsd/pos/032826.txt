This is an outstanding edition of Milton's classic work.  Kastan provides references for words that have fallen out of modern day usage, making the text easier for today's reader to understand.  The text is full of extensive footnotes, providing clarification, background data, and, for further study, references to Milton's original sources. The font size and paper quality of this paperback text make it a pleasure to read and transport.
