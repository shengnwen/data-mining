Michael Boatman is a perfect reader for this story.  His voice is casual and "philosophical".  Some of the story could have gotten bogged down in melodrama, but he keeps things on an even keel, while at the same time making the critique of life in Flint even more devastating.  Momma's smooth, cool voice almost sounds reasonable, until you realize how ruthless she is.  

Well done.  One of the best audiobooks I have listened to.
