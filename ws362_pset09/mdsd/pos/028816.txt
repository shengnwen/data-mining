Summer's House is a wonderful novel that engages the reader from the first mysterious page.  The three leading characters are all intriguing and complex people that you care about and understand.   The language is poetic  and evocative, with many monents that stop you in your tracks to let the  richness and vividness sink in.  There are several mysteries that unfold  throughout the book and the clues are woven into a plot that pulls you  along.  The intensity of the character's plights at times becomes almost  palpable through the writer's style and pacing.  All through the novel  there is a thread of sexuality which is tenderly and convincingly  portrayed-whether it is a young man's stumbling forays into the world of  adult sex or the sad attempt of an older man to find love and redemption in  an affair.  If you like multli-generational family stories (with a Jewish  backdrop) movingly told, with beautiful prose, you'll love Summer's House
