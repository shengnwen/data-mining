It hasn't been too long since I started in the Customer Service industry, but I do have to say this book has changed my entire way of thinking when it comes to customer service.  I highly reccomend it, and it doesn't matter what type of company you work for, somewhere along the line you have to answer to customers, whether it is someone at a store buying a product from you directly, or whether it is someone that works on the other side of the assembly line, a customer is whoever comes in contact with your product.  I absolutely reccomend this book to anyone who has ever been dissatisfied before
