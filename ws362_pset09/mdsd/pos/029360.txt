I am a final year graduate student and I started reading this book as a part of the reading assignment for the course "Systems Testing and Verification". I found this book very valuable for the internship I am doing as a product test engineer. The book is indispesible guide for the beginner and good reference for the professionals. The real world experience of the author makes this book an appropriate guide line for all those who wants to deal with testing process. I have applied some key concepts from the book for the test cases I designed and the result was quite satisfying. I would not have come up with such a good test cases on my own without refering to this book. Its worth keeping this book as a future reference
