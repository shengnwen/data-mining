My brother owns a very popular restaurant. Award winning in fact.  He has lots of cookbooks he uses in addition to his own or his chef's creations.  Many a time when I asked my brother for a recipe he whispered to me that he got it from The JOY of Cooking.

Now my name is Joy and I love to cook.  Enough of an excuse to buy this book as any. But what version I wondered...  So I searched around and felt that this vintage copy from 1975 was very well received.  

In my humble opinion this is THE cookbook to have in one's cookbook library.  I learned a lot about the origins of recipes along with fun anecdotes.  This book really TEACHES as well as lists the ingredients.   And how many books will give you recipes for woodchuck along with hummus?  You name the recipe, it is IN there.  Lots of tried and true plus plenty of recipes new to try.  

Now as far as the durability/quality of the book itself.  I wish it were better made.  As far as production values they have cut corners a bit but the quality of the recipes are such that I can let it go I suppose.  Yet it bothers me enough that I gave it four stars instead of five.  I give it five for the recipes and content though.

Am spoiled in that I had assumed there would be some photos of dishes.  Does contain some illustrations but I do love a cookbook which contains pics of the dishes.

This book also contains suggestions for serving and menus for holidays and special occasions.

So for my money, this book is more than worth the cost!
