Wow, what an epic.  
The book draws you in to the sinister world of Derry Maine so quickly, and deeply, that you don't want to leave when the last page is read. 
With a book so large in volume and scope each reader is bound to find faults with the story, but this world is so full of rich characters, these problems disappear into the pages and eventually vanish.
I originally read this book in High School.  After my first re-read 15 years later, the horror of the what goes on in the town of Derry every 28 years had a bigger impact on me.  However, the adventure and wonderment I pulled from the story then, came flooding back again.  The first half of the book is a coming of age story, with evil stalking the town as a backdrop.  The second half of the book is a story of re-discovery and responsibility, with evil lurking closer in each character's shadows.
Just a fantastic book that reminds the reader of the power we had as children
