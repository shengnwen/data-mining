 
Just about all of the advice in the book will help a real estate investor enhance his returns through smart tax planning. Saving money on taxes means more to the bottom line, which increases returns. This is not a rah-rah get pumped up to do deals type book, more of a step by step type explanation of how to best protect yourself (using LLC's or Corporations) and how to save on taxes (1031 exchange). They also touch on the relatively new TIC (Tenants in Common) structure, which is looking more and more useful because it will let partners out of a deal to do a 1031 without having to sell the whole property. 

Overall it's all stuff a real estate investor needs to know, but I personally would have liked more real life deal examples. In Dolf's 52 homes in 52 weeks there are lots of examples (52) of him doing deals with a breakdown of the profit or loss on each.
