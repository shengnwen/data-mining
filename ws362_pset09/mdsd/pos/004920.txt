I really liked this book for several reasons. First of all, it is extremely well written and relatively easy to understand when considering the content involved. For example, DeLanda gives interpretations of Deleuze and Guatarri's work that, at least for me, greatly aided in clarifying &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot;. Even though i was previously familiar with D &amp; G, who DeLanda draws from extensively, i had never before read, for example, Prigogine or Braudel. However, unlike many authors who demand that one has extensive background knowledge of the writers discussed, DeLanda takes the time to give meaningful and understandable interpretations of these writers such that one previously unfamiliar can gain a suitable understanding. Furthermore, DeLanda provides extensive examples of his philosophy &quot;in action&quot; in history, such as the &quot;double articulation&quot; machine that he borrows from D &amp; G. Yet again, unlike D &amp; G, who provide vague and jagged examples of their philosophy, DeLanda goes deep into each example, explaining it in detail rather than assuming knowledge on the part of the reader. In fact, much of the &quot;philosophical&quot; content of &quot;A Thousand Years...&quot; is borrowed. However, even so, DeLanda APPLIES this philosophy masterfully and in a unique and suitably complex manner.  This is a book that i would reccomend to persons in all fields of study and employment, as it explores many of problems in our current system and aids in understanding what otherwise might be taken for granted
