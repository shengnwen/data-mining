A 13-hour drive from Tacoma to Salt Lake City for a funeral was made infinitely more entertaining by the companionship of this book-on-tape.  Yeah, it probably could have been wrapped up a little faster, but I was frankly sorry to hear it end.  I totally enjoyed the characters, situations, and exotic locations.  There was humor, mystery, murder, sex, drugs, religion, transexual prostitutes, circus dwarves...what a ride!  I'd highly recommend it for any road trip.
