Wonderfully organized with just enough tips and pointers
about food types and how to prepare.  Beautifully illustrated
(just not for every recipe) with simple and straightforward
directions.  Excellent collection of classic and innovative
recipes that cover virtually all the bases.  The only
cook book you need to keep you very busy.  Outstanding
