This is a smart woman who runs her own orange grove in the 40s and 50s in central Florida. I recently drove around the small towns of central Florida and was bowled-over by the beauty. Miss Rawlings describes not only the birds, critters, domestic animals she owns and how she hunts, fishes, gardens, cooks and throws parties in the Florida wilderness in style, she also shows how whites in the deep south thought of blacks ("negros or darkies", she calls them) and talks about the humorous problems she has with her negro servants. Cross Creek is a slice of heaven and Marjorie Rawlings is just the woman to tell us about it. You'll feel like you are right there with her, loving every redbird and wildflower right along with her. HIGHLY recommended!
