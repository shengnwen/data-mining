"Basque Terrorism" got great reviews in the Spanish press. One notable exception was "El Pais" which devoteed nearly a full page to condemning it. (The paper was at the time a friendly conduit for the Gonzales government. During its time in power, 27 Basque activists were murdered by security agencies.)

The strength of the book is in the details. Different aspects of the life and history of the Basque nation are brought together with strong, simple logic. It shows how hopes of freedom took the only path left open
