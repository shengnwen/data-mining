Pretty decent book.  It gives a really good introduction to Omaha and for those trying to learn already having a decent amount of knowledge of other poker games, it isn't boring or full of useless information.  It's pretty straight foward and well organized.  For those looking to learn the game, it'll get you off on the right foot
