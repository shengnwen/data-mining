I really enjoy Grafton's books even on repeat reads. There is a lot more to them than just figuring out the mystery. Grafton writes a personal story which has been developing for 10 books up to this one (at the time of writing this Grafton has just published S is for Silence) and in all of them the essence of Kinsey is both strong, and with all relationships - it is developing. 

In J is for Judgement Kinsey is now working for herself based in the law offices of Kingham and Ives. However Kinsey's boss from the Insuarance company, mac Vorhooies comes to visit her - apparently Wendell Jaffe has been spotted in Mexico - trouble is Wendell Jaffe is supposed to be dead. Kinsey is hired to investigate.

This book draws us through a whole heap of usual twists and turns, but also draws us deeper into Kinsey's own past. We have slowly been learning about her strange past and why she has turned out as she has. Each novel usually reveals a few more scraps. In this we get a dinner plate full.

I liked this book for its inconclusive finish. While there was a neatly wound up conclusion to the mystery, the ending in itself shows the possibility that this might all come up again in the future. I thought it was neatly done. 

I have to admit that I am a huge fan of Kinsey Millhone and the only novel I have not really enjoyed - or should I say, felt disappointed in was P is for Peril. I liked the first three best - they were shorter and punchier than the later ones. But I just love the way Kinsey works through things. I also like the way we just visit with her for a short period and some things in her personal life are sorted out and other things hang inthe balance to the next installment. Pretty much like real life
