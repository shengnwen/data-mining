As a nurse, I highly recommend this book for new parents.  It is easy to read and understand for all audiences.  I found many answers here that prevented me from calling the pediatrician or advice nurse after hours.  It is divided into sections by age so don't let the number of pages intimidate you - keep it by your bed and read a few pages when you have a spare moment
