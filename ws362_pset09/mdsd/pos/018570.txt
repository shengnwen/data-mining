Intermingling witty observations with a fluid expository style, the author paints a multifaceted picture of the hybrid gypsy/ conventional trappings of many of today's upscale professionals. He even coins a term bobo, a contraction of the phrase bohemian - bourgouisie to categorize this demographic. 

What I find troubling in Brooks' thesis is his interpretation that adaptations of the aesthetic motifs and insignia from any cultural or economic group other than of one's own heritage is necessarily an act of pretension. His view seems to be that the bobo lifestyle is predicated on an "I'm more globally and ecologically conscious than you" one upmanship which basically boils down to consumerism and display on a grand scale. Any lifestyle could be a pretension. A well-meaning attempt at synthesizing appealing aspects of other heritages need not brand one as a poseur. After all, there is much evidence to show that cultural intermingling (not always of benign impetus) has been more the rule than the exception in human history.

Brooks does not explore the "why's" of boboism. The ease and frequency of international travel, as well as the massive influx to the USA of immigrants, the acceptance of marriage outside one's demographic and the diversity promoted by institutes of higher education  could well be contributing factors. Also, the very traits that helped bobos rise to their economic level - innovativeness and creativity - could themselves motivate bobos to explore the kinds of novelty Brooks describes in their personal lives.
