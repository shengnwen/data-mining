Roland Bainton (1894-1984), a distinguished professor of church history at Yale University was a fine literary stylist who wore his learning lightly. Here I Stand has been in print since its publication more than fifty years ago, and it has sold over a million copies.  

Bainton was already a thorough student of the Protestant Reformation when he began writing this biography in the 1940s, and his maturity encouraged a sensitive, though not uncritical, interpretation of the great reformer.  Especially impressive is Bainton's ability to explain Luther's doctrinal beliefs clearly and sympathetically even though Bainton himself was neither a Lutheran nor an evangelical.  

In my opinion, Here I Stand is one of the finest biographies written in the early twentieth century.  I read the book first in 1972, and on coming back to it thirty-four years later was even more impressed with its literary and historical worth.  It is the epitome of the word "classic."

In passing, the original Abingdon hardback edition is significantly more pleasant to read than modern paperback versions, with their tiny type squeezed right to the margins
