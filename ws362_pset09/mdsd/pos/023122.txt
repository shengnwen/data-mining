The concept of Recipies 1-2-3 is intriguing: recipies with only 3 ingredients (water, salt, and pepper not included).  In many ways, this simplifies recipes.  However, the tradeoff is that cooking techniques or unique ingredients (e.g. tahini) are often substitutes for creating flavor,  which may challenge some readers.  The book also offers tips for adding  ingredients to improve the dishes, complete menus using recipes from the  book, and helpful wine pairings.  I will probably check out Rozanne Gold's  other books in the future
