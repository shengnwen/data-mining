As the sequel to Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat changes the focus away from Louis, and towards the true protagonist of the Vampire Chonicles, Lestat.  The novel beginning with Lestat's childhood (far before the timeline of Interview), continues with a retelling of the events in the previous novel (revealing that Louis version of events is a bending of the truth at best - also many events that were omitted in the first novel are included here that enhance the story) as well as continuing the story onward post Interview timeline telling what becomes of Lestat, Louis, and many other intriguing characters.  The Vampire Lestat is an excellent novel and rivals its predecessor in quality.  After reading this novel, I would highly recommend to continue with the third novel in the Vampire chronicles, The Queen of the Damned.  Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned are in my opinion the best three novels of the series and are true classics of the genre
