A nice short little novel that you can read in 2 days time.  Not perfect.  I'm not a huge sci-fi buff, and there were parts of it that bugged me, mainly the way it seemed very 1950's (when it was written) even though it's set in the year 2203.  For example, women still have a fairly subserviant role to men, everyone smokes (even on airplanes) and drinks scotch at work.  Nice to know that in the future we'll be able to smoke and drink scotch in the office!  None of the characters are ever fully fleshed out (though Dick seems obsessed with describing all the female character's breasts) and their behavior is sometimes unnatural and unexpected, but overall an entertaining book with a nice little twist at the end
