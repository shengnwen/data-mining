*	The famous journalist Walter Lippman once said, "The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind in others the conviction and will to carry on."

*	That is the test for all of us, not only those is a managerial position, but all of us.  A leader may be the guy in a suit and tie down in the corner office, but a leader can also be the sixty year old woman working as a cashier who knows not to put our bread and canned goods in the same bag.

*	Every one of us leads, whether directly or indirectly, in the actions we perform every day.  Whether we know it or not, right now, each of us is showing something the right way to be or the wrong way to be.  

*	James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner, discuss in their bestselling book The Leadership Challenge, the five principles they have found in leaders who have teams that get "extraordinary" things done:

*	These leaders:

*	Challenge the Process

*	Inspire a shared vision

*	Enable others to act

*	Model the way

*	And, Encourage the Heart.

*	But what does it mean to "encourage the heart?"

*	Encouraging the Heart shows how, with a few main ideas, how each of us - management or not - can take the initiative to bring common courtesy and kindness into the workplace, and how effective that everyday emotional bond between human beings can translate into a successful, more productive, and generally happier workplace.  

*	And as we all know, the more content the team is, the better that team will be.  And a successful team is often attributed to the successful leader of that team.  Encouraging the heart forms that connection, and helps boost the overall strength of the team as well as the strength of the leader.
