What an amazing read.  Compelling from start to finish.

Professor Benjamin Stern is found dead in his Munich apartment.  He also happens to be a former Israeli intelligence operative and close friend of Gabriel Allon, a part time Mossad agent, part time world class art restorer.

From there, some questions about the Catholic church's role in the Holocaust are brought into the light.  Great reading throughout with a lot of historical information.

I was kind of disappointed by the endings in the Kill Artist and the English Assassin, but this did not disappoint.  Definitely Silva's best work to date.  Can't wait to start a Death in Vienna
