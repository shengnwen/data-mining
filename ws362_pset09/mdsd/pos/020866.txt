Great book, could not put it down - read it in one day, stayed up till 3 am! I am a dating coach and reading latest books about dating, seduction, pickup, love, romance, relationships etc is a part of my job description. This book is so different from everything else that is available on the market; no wonders it caused such a stir. Even my married friends talk about it (mostly about the fact that their wives will not allow them to read it! I tell them they can borrow it from me :-))

It's a novel, but it is also a true-life story and a pickup manual - all in one. 

It can seem completely surreal at times; especially to men who don't know how to talk to sexy women. And yes, guys, we women love men who know how to give us what we want - both in and out of bed. If you were thinking that women hate players, think again - women are fascinated by players, and if you ask any woman, whether she is a sexy 20-year old or a gray-haired granny, what was their most exciting romantic experience, they will tell you about some player that swept her off her feet. It probably didn't last but this was something she will remember for the rest of her life. This is the type of experience you can give to a woman if you learn how to be a pickup artist... wouldn't it be great if men and women could give each other exactly what the other party wants? Well, this is possible - if you know how.

If you are a man (single or attached), read this book to understand the psychology behind success with women. It can change your whole outlook on love and relationships.
