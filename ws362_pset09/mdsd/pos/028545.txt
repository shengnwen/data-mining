I am an MBA/Graduate Marketing Research adjunct professor at Lindenwood University in St. Louis, MO and I am currently using this text for my class. The students find it very accessible, even for non-researchers, and easy to read. I find that it flows very well and makes good use of real-world examples. The only criticism is that there could be even more real-world cases and examples and some interactive projects that could better allow students to have a more hands-on learning experience. This text is very good overall, but I am needing to supplement the class with some outside real-world projects
