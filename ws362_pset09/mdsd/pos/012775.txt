I came to this script as a writer looking for help with a project set in the 19th century. I was deeply impressed by the screenplay when I saw the movie, but didn't realise why until I spent hours studying this wonderful  book. It seems to me the script works because it authentically relates us  to the language of Jane Austen (how can you argue with a line like &quot;I  will brook no refusals&quot;?), while anchoring it firmly in the  intelligence and humour of a lovely late 20th century voice - a voice with  the same... well, sensibilities (couldn't resist). The diaries are a  perfect companion for this volume, and read not unlike Jane Austen's  letters.  Whether Thompson knew this as she wrote or not, - who cares. If  she didn't, she's brilliant, and if she did, she's more brilliant. The  clarity and economy of all the writing affirms the adage about brevity  being the soul of wit: wit and soul are here in abundance. This book makes  you long for Jane Austen and Emma Thompson to sit down together for a bit  of a chin wag and gossip over coffee and cigarettes. After all those  families of sisters, I think Jane would feel she'd finally found the real  thing! -  in the spiritual sense! Buy. Read. Enjoy
