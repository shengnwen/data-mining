I keep this around for when I'm bored and just want to browse and think about materials, but it's most useful for when you forget things. For instance, when you forget exactly how much dammar resin to soak in turpentine, like I did today. I found the answer in seconds and went back to work. Very, very handy. On the other hand, if you're not doing two-dimensional work, this won't be so handy. This is a great text on painting, drawing, and formal aspects and techniques in those areas
