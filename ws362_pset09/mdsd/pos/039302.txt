Really, it's the Ten Commandments that are the subject of this book. 700 Club host Pat Robertson offers a history of the movement to remove the Decalogue, as well as anything that has to do with God or the Bible, from courthouses, schools, and public life.

Robertson focuses in on the recent case of Alabama Supreme Court Judge Roy Moore, who defiantly disobeyed a court order to remove a monument from the Ala. Supreme Court Building, and eventually was removed from the court.

Finally, Robertson focuses on each of the Ten Commandments, their meaning and relevance for each of us, and practical ways for each of us to get involved in defending the Ten Commandments and becoming more active in civic responsiblilty.

I highly recommend this book.
