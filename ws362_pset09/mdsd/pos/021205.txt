This is an account of a life lived in the shadows of the crematoria. It is based on the author's experience as a non-Jew, in a German concentration camp.  As a non-Jew, Borowski was entitled to certain privileges.  He maintained his position in the hierarchy by following the orders of the S.S. guards: by ordering the Jews to line up on their way to the gas chambers, and by sorting through the luggage of the dead.  This book is dark, dark realism, and Borowski doesn't shy away from the details (descriptions of the pit where corpses were burned are especially difficult to forget).  Borowski lived at a time when, as Jan Kott writes in the introduction: "individual human destiny seems as if shaped directly by history, becoming only a chapter in it."  Borowski provided us with this, his chapter.  His destiny was suicide, and this direct, raw account of a terrible ordeal helps us to understand why
