Great fiction carries with it more than the story it tells.  It contains also timeless and universal themes that continue to speak to us long after we finish the last page.   Les Miserable is one of those great fiction works that will give us pause to consider where law and grace meet and diverge.  At the same time it is a beautiful tale of love and devotion to truth.  Do not miss this gem of literature.   The musical is wonderful, the book is even better
