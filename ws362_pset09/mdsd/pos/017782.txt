I am currently reading "Momfidence" and can't praise Spencer enough for having the guts to write so wittily and truthfully about the current parenting trends we are surrounded by . . . Thank you, thank you for confirming that we are not bad parents if our boys aren't signed up simultaneously in 14 activities and going to camp for 6 weeks this summer. Thank you for freeing us from the guilt of allowing our kids to play in the park across the street without adult chaperones (my boys are ages  8, 11 and 13). We are not doing our children any favors by micromanaging every second of their free time, and not allowing them time to be kids! I want to give a copy to every mom I know that gets 4 hours of sleep a nite because they are too busy running their kids lives and being run by them. I will recommend this book to every mom I know! Bring on #2, "Momfidence: The Teen Years"
