Skye Denison has hired sexy contractor Beau Hamilton to renovate the old house she inherited.  Everyone recommended him, after all.  His good looks don't hurt either.  Especially since Skye has sworn off men since her breakup with her boyfriend.

Unfortunately Skye soon realizes his work isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Before she can fire him, she finds him murdered.  Who could have killed the contractor?  Soon Skye finds the list goes on forever.  Can she find the killer without putting herself in danger?  Plus should she give Simon another chance?  Then there's Chief Wally Boyd who is showing real interest in her.  What's a girl to do?

I love this series.  School psychologist Skye Denison is such a fun character.  No wonder the kids love her so much.  I was happy to see Wally and her giving it a chance in this book.  I'm not sure which man I want to see her with, but she hadn't even given Wally a turn so that she could make a better decision.

I always enjoy the wacky characters in this series.  The author has done a great job of creating an enjoyable series with a town full of interesting people.  This installment didn't disappoint!  I can't wait to read the next book.  I highly recommend this book and series.
