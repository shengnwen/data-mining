I have children ages 8-12, and we use Klutz window art all year long. I've bought this product over and over. It's great for all ages, even for the grown-ups. We put them up all over the house, and when I'm tired of them, down they go, and the kids eventually get into making more. The older kids get creative and do some beautiful art. They love it, I love it, and it's minimally messy. It's great for sleep-overs (b/c they take a while to dry), and nieces and nephews who see their own designs on our windows sometimes for months. One of my all-time favorite toys!
