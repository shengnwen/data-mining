Skillfully edited by Dana L. Robert (University School of Theology), Gospel Bearers, Gender Barriers: Missionary Women In The Twentieth Century is a scholarly selection of essays by a variety of articulate and learned contributors focusing on the often overlooked role of female missionaries around the world and throughout the decades of twentieth century Christian history. Studying the role of women in missionary movements in both Protestant and Catholic denominations, the conflict as to whether Christian missions have raised or lowered the status of women in Africa, and many other relevant themes, Gospel Bearers, Gender Barriers is a unique and very highly recommended addition to Christian History and Women's Studies reading lists and academic reference collections
