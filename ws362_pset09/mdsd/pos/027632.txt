I FOUND THIS BOOK BY ACCIDENT AT A BOOK SALE.  I LOVED IT FROM THE FIRST  PAGE.  IT IS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO WAS KIDNAPPED AT AGE 7 AND LIVED HER LIFE AS  A CAPTIVE IN A MAN'S HOUSE.  HER VIEW OF HER WORLD IS PERCEPTIVE, POETIC  AND SENSITIVE.  SHE STABS HER CAPTOR, IS IMPRISONED AND THEN RELEASED.   THIS BOOK GRABBED A HOLD OF ME AND WOULD NOT LET GO UNTIL I FINISHED IT.   THE CHARACTERS ARE REAL AND I WAS LEAD ALONG UNTIL THE SURPRISE ENDING.  I  WASN'T SURE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT KEPT ME HOOKED
