A difficulty with approaching such a prolific author as Bourdieu is determining where one should begin reading.  This short, 150-page book composed of mostly lectures and concise essays serves as an excellent beginning to not only gaining a grasp of the key ideas put forth by Bourdieu..., but also, insofar as Bourdieu throughout the work is reviewing a lifetime of sociological writing, it serves as an excellent topical mapping of his previous works giving small tastes of previous studies on Kabylia, Distinction, Homo Academicus, etc.  While there are moments when the brevity of treatment makes for a meager argument, I would nonetheless recommend this book to anyone with a desire to begin exploring the works and ideas of Bourdieu
