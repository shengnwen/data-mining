A wonderful book! Father David Anderson (an Episcopal priest from Bucks County PA) has written a book that is spiritually uplifting. It is an enjoyable read for the religious and the non-religious alike. He has elements of Buddahism as well as the Benedictine and Franciscan spirituality of seeing the wonder of the spirit of God in the daily grind that we all live each day. Highly recommended!
