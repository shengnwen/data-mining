Too short. That's actually the impression I had when I finished reading Washington: The Indispensable Man. A distillation (but not an abridgement) of author James Thomas Flexner's longer four volume work on Washington, this book left me wanting more because four hundred pages is simply not enough to do justice to the man.

The first thing to point out is that Washington was really a fascinating guy. If his life wasn't one of adventure and drama, then those words have no meaning. Emerson said of him, "Every hero becomes a bore at last". Well, I never liked Emerson. Any competent biography on Washington should make it clear that the image of a marble founding father does a disservice to history.

There's little need to recap here the events that make up the framework of the text. Most of them are known to potential readers, at least in part, and the gaps are easily filled in. From his early life to his presidency, and ultimately to his death, the vivid color of Washington's presence in the world is brought to life.
