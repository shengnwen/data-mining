I do not have much to add to what has already been said but I will give it a go.  This is one of the clearest, most succinct, and well studied books on why materialism is making American's unhealthy.  This book does not harp but brings 10+ years of original research to bear on the subject and leaves the reader thinking that something must be done to make changes. 

Check this one out as soon as possible and use it to state to your friends why buying more will not make them happy.
