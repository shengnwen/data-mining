After reading this book I began to think of many different things about myself. At first the book seemed kind of dull but give it a chapter or so and you won't want to put it down. This book gives references of the once  again if you've read any other of my reviews by the people for the people.  This book deals with big politics and community politics. It offers  approaches as a person to realize the problems of the inner city but not so  much but how blacks are being taken advantage of. This book is an insight  into how businesses in the black community should under contracts be forced  to spend at least ten to twenty percent of their earnings in the black  community on schlorships, helping businesses,helping the homeless,etc. It  gives case studies of different black comunities and how they confronted  the powers that be. This book is a must read for all blacks, going into the  next political change for us to understand where this system of government  between Gore and Bush will leave minorities for the next term. This will  also give non-minorities a chance to see what are the struggles that us as  so called minorities go through that some quite can't understand. Everyone  reading this review stay peaceful in your endeavers and life and stay  focused, Assalaamu Alaykiu
