PROS: 
This book offers substantial advice; the most useful piece of which (in my opinion) was "In the essays, be sure to ANSWER THE ESSAY QUESTION, the whole question and nothing but the question." It also walks the reader through several multiple choice passages.

CONS: The literary term list was somewhat basic, and in general, the essay-writing advice seemed confining and old fashioned. 

For a more jazzy, student-friendly AP English Lit. Prep book, see the Princeton Review.
