This is a wonderful story about a young girl's Oma who is moving into a retirement home. It shows how hard it can be for her grandmother moving from the home she's known for so long, and trying to adjust to her new surroundings. It teaches a lot of empathy for the elderly, but without being preachy. My own daughter calls her grandparents "Oma" and "Opa" (German for Grandmother and Grandfather) and although her Oma isn't quite read for retirement yet, and doesn't make cabbage soup and strudel, it really helped bring the story to life for her. Every child can probably find a bit of their own grandparents in the story. The illustrations are as excellent as the story
