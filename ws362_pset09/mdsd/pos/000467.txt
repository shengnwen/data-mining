This book is a collection of essay/lectures Eco has presented. They range over a variety of interesting philosophical issues -- which are well presented and thought out.  The theme throughout is that incorrect ideas  can result in useful results.  Like all of Eco's writing (with which I am  familiar) his ideas require some attention and thought on the part of the  reader.  But this was for me a very accessible book, perhaps reflecting its  origin as lectures, and well worth reading
