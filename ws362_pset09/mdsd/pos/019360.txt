The "Thief Lord" is a wonderful contemporary story full of loss, beauty, adventure and a little bit of magic.  Cornelia Funke's book has one several literary prizes and even bumped Harry Potter off the best sellers list in Germany and Northern Europe for a time.  It never talks down to kids and is engaging to adults as well.  The imagery of Venice is dead-on (just like I remembered) and the characters(Prosepero, Scipio) are richly portrayed.  This is a story that is light on the fantastic but heavy on imagery and imagination just like the classics!

The main protaganists are boys but boys and girls can enjoy this book equally as there are a few standout female characters also.  Geared to young readers 8-12 and also adults
