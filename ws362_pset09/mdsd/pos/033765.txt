A collection of short stories that I first read for a Black Literature class when I was in college in the '70....and here recently, shared it with my book club as our book of the month. Ms. Walker's writing style makes you  feel you are right there with the character. While each story presents  different experiences of African-American women, women of all nationalities  will be able to relate to the stories and the emotions. It's a fast paced  book that is heart-warming, amusing, sad,....every emotion is touched
