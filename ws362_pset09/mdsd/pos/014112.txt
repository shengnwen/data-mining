Flann O'Brien never says anything outright, he is not direct, and he loves language. Sounds like exactly the type of author who would fade away in today's forever colloquial world. This is not the case. Flann O'Brien represents the funniest and least pretentious of what I call the holy Irish trinity of literature (Joyce, Beckett, O'Brien). This is his beggining, and as such is absolutely brilliant. The novel is post modern before post modernity, follows no set story, offers up brilliant ideas, and is very funny. O'Brien plays with language in a way that should make everyone jealous. His monologues about booze and it's effect are some of the most entertaining I have ever read. This is not a story, as we are used to. Similar to Joyces last two works it is the novel removed. You don't sit down and read this like a conventional novel, but, you can flip through it once you are familiar with it and it offers more re-readability than normal novels as a result. Flann O'Brien is endlessly imaginative, and his phrasing is a force to be reckoned with. This, along with L.F. Celine, is some of the best comedy in high art ever. If you like to laugh while you think, pick up Flann O'Brien........but I reccomend starting with The Thid Policeman, which is infinitely more readable, and cohesive. This is O'Briens only novel in this style, but a bold and funny experiment it was
