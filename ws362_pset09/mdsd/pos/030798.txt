This book was excellent to read - very well written.  If you have breast cancer or have a loved one with breast cancer - it's a must read.  I have breast cancer and loved reading their stories.  I felt like we were friends sharing information.  The story does show you the real side of cancer and what can happen.  It's just a good book for anyone to read.  I still go back and re-read sections that meant a lot to me.  Buy this book for you or a loved one.  Cancer needs to be understood and all women (and men) should read this book
