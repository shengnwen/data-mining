I have two children with autism and found this book to be very interesting regarding behaviors and how as adults the subjects lived.  However the writing gets a little wordy.  The author goes on in detail, for instance, on communication problems.  Of course you have to remember that the author has autism himself, which makes me understand his need to go into detail.  Still you can speed read over the parts in detail and the actual people are very interesting.  I could see my children in some of the subjects and it helped me to understand them a little better
