This was a textbook for a class I took on eschatology.  Most of the book was assigned reading, and I chose to read the remaining chapters that were unassigned.  I was impressed with how thorough the book treated every single aspect of end times.  Many views are given to the various issues, but the traditional dispensational views are almost always defended.  The book is somewhat outdated with the new schools of thought on eschatology.  I would recommend the book to any student of prophecy
