Two years ago, I didn't know the difference between am exacta and a trifecta, or a fig from a fig newton.  All that changed when I ordered my first book on racing "Picking Winners" by Andy Beyer.  I had read Beyer's horseracing articles in the Washington Post for years, but was such a novice, that I had no idea that he had to speed handicapping like no other before him.

Picking Winners introduced me to the game -- to what handicapping was all about.  Beyer gets you started.  Read this book, and any novice is ready to go to the track and at least have some fun pretending he knows what he's doing.

The most important aspect of this book, of course, was my introduction to the Beyer speed figures.  They are all he claims them to be; they are not all what others claim them to be.  The figs are not the Holy Grail -- but you'll never find the Grail without them.

Most importantly, Beyer gave me an instant understanding of the horseracing game -- no crap -- no esoteric wanderings, but a true working knowledge of handicapping techniques -- and did I mention the speed figs?  (haha)  

If you are new to the game or if you have little knowledge of those mysterious numbers highlighted in the DRF under "Speed,"  get this book.

After two years and a dozen other books, I still refer to it several times a week.  It has made betting the horses for me a fun, and most often profitable hobby
