Adler and Doren believe that reading well is an art.  This book gives a step by step method to reading difficult books well.  I like this book because it has helped me to read 3 books that I found difficult to read (Homer's Illiad and Odyssey and Plato's Dialogues including The Republic).
The authors provide a Great Book list in the Appendix.
