     I loved it. I got it yesterday afternoon and had it read in tow hours! I wouldn't call it Ann's best but still worth priase. The book is based on Ann Rinaldi's grandparents whom she never meet. The story is told through the eyes of Rose, a fifteen year old girl who enjoys very much being a child. Rose watches her sister Heppi get married and dreads the thought of it happing to her. But on the night Heppi's engagment is announced Rose's father introduces her to Rene Dumarest, a weathly silk merchant. Though Rene is twice her age Rose is still attracted to him and fears that her sister and schoolmate may be right about Rene wanting to marry her. And when he does indeed ask her to be his wife she plans to refuse until her schoolmate tells her that Rene holds the morgage to her fathers home and farm. In order to save her father finacially she marries Rene and moves with him to New York were her first day is less than injoyable and dead woman is found in the kitchen. Through plenty of trials and errors life begins to settle into a steady pace until Rose disovers she is pregante and that her mother in law is a terrible prick. In the end all's well that ends well
