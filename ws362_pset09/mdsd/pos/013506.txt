First, even if you are in AA, this is a must read.  This program addresses alcoholism not only from a psychological standpoint, but as a physiological problem that many rehabs and programs don't address adequately.  The recommendations in this book have done wonders for my alcohol cravings, and for the first time in my life, I think I may be able to live without this substance that I have come to love and depend on so much.  This program gives you the option to drink moderately or be abstinent and certainly does not have a negative view towards AA, which means that I think those of you who are struggling in AA could combine this program with that one and see things improve greatly.  There isn't a magic cure, but if you have motivation and follow this program to the tee, I guarantee you will see the results you are hoping for.  Good luck
