Ok, so I get some of you out there that felt the book was drawn out a little. But they way I see it, is that the entire story was well developed and therefore what they are assuming is drawn out is just the development of the characters. These characters weren't shallow and the business concept itself needed to be wroked out. Not sure if you noticed, but this really could be a business venture. If you have partook in any business venture you'll enjoy that piece alone. It is slow to start, but once it has you, IT has you! Happy reading
