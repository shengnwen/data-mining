A story overheard by chance in a restaurant puts Lord Peter Wimsey on the trail of a woman who may have committed the perfect murder.  The investigation leads him and his associates, Inspector Parker and spinster detective Miss Climpson, back and forth between city and country before the suspenseful (if rather contrived) conclusion.  The background and details of this novel, first published in 1927, add interest.  Several lesbian characters (though never directly identified as such) figure prominently, but unfortunately author Dorothy Sayers adheres to the common theme that homosexuals are particularly prone to all manner of vices.  Still, this is an enjoyable mystery
