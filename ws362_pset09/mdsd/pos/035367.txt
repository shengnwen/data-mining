The plot captivates you from the first page. Taking two of horrors most legendary creatures and pitting them against each other, Underworld grabs an old idea and adds an element fans have been wondering for years. Who would win in a fight, Dracula or the Wolfman? What would be the repercussions if the strengths of both villains were combined into one individual? Another fear of mine was that there would be more action than story. Not so. Although the action is constant throughout the book, there is significantly more dialogue. Which would be a plus in any book, but in an adaptation it's a gold star. What I will say though is that for a complete overall enjoyment, read the book and watch the movie. Keep the balance and share the love. 
 
The pace in the book is hypersonic. You are constantly moving and shifting with just a brief pause in between. The atmosphere is dark, dank and heated. The location constantly shifts between a centuries old castle and an underground hideout. Both carry an air of desperation and the smell of decay. Cox's style of writing is both generous and sympathetic. He pens his tales with compassion, as though this battle existed inside him. Be it the screenplay or his own identity shining through, the man creates a world that is hauntingly alluring. 
 
The characters come off as cold, vengeful monsters. With loyalty the only tie that binds them, each one screams villain. That is the biggest twist in the book. Granted, they have barely any morals, kill daily and regret very little and yet, they still manage to extract sympathy. Even gaining love and understanding. Also just for the record, the book clearly explains the development of the attraction between Selene and Michael.
