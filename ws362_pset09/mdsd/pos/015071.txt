I don't think you should read this book hoping to find HOW TO retire young and retire rich as most people would think of. The book doesn't tell you that. What the book DOES, is help you change your mind, the only thing I think that will really help you change your financial reality. I don't get tired of reading Kiyosaki. The more you read, the more you understand
