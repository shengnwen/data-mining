I think A Deep Breath of Life is the best daily inspiration book out there. It has it all--heartwarming and humorous stories, with  inspiring messages and powerful prayers and affirmations that gently lift me from any  feelings of anxiety or sadness to that loving, peaceful place of  empowerment and joy. What a wonderful way to start the day! I have also  made Alan's book my number one gift for all occasions to family, friends,  colleagues, and others I meet who may appreciate its daily dose of loving,  spiritual nourishment. In fact, since I bought my first copy several years  ago,  I have given away 48 copies of A Deep Breath of Life
