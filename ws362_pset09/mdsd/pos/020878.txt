Since the puzzles are hard (challenging?) I find the paper quality in this book to be poor.  If I can't see the solution right away and need to mark in some possibilities, I find that the paper deteriorates when I erase and does not erase cleanly.  There are other books out there that have paper that stands up to erasing nicely.

The difficulty aspect is awesome for those looking for puzzles that take awhile to complete.  What good is a puzzle that is finished in just a few minutes?  You won't find those in this book
