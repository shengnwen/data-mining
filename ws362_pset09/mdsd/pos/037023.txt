A mystical summons may have caused the major characters in ELSEWHERE IN THE LAND OF PARROTS to pursue a flock of conures into the mangrove forests of Ecuador. Even though I don't expect to receive such a call, I could appreciate the boisterous challenge issuing from the novel's parrots. "Wake up!" they seem to say. The parrots are Nature's representatives in this book, and Nature is shown to be everywhere--in the city, on an ocean-going freighter, in a cage in the jungle. A person who dares to open his eyes to the world will find his life enriched, as do the reclusive poet David and the somewhat naive zoologist Fern in this charming and often moving book.

Wherever the story goes, Jim Paul smoothly and efficiently evokes a strong sense of place. Descriptions are lyrical but unsentimental. It's a joy to follow David's emergence and Fern's explorations as they take the steps that will ultimately bring them together. There is a quirky sense of humor at work but also an underlying urgency. The parrots need people to look out for them.

I have two parrot roommates and couldn't help but be drawn to the round inquisitive eyes of the conure--or shall I use the more elegant word "aratinga"--on the cover. I was glad that the novel's birds act like BIRDS. They are not the talking stereotypes who utter improbable punch lines on sitcoms.

However, one does not need to be a bird-fancier to enjoy this book. The reader will meet charming characters, travel to exotic places, and find new wonders in even commonplace surroundings. It's a well-written story about awakenings, and about journeys with hopeful endings
