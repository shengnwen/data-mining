This is the story of an Indian merchant's triumphs and failures, both business and personal, in a river port town in an unnamed African country.  It is also the story of the town itself, and of Africa's struggle with itself and with outsiders.

I listened to the unabridged audio, and look forward to reading the actual book some day when I'm not on the road so much
