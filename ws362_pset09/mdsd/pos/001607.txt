Lately I have been disappointed with the books done in VC Andrew's name.  It seemed as if they were just mass-produced carbon copies:  same story, different names and places.  

However, "Celeste" has gone back to the style that VC had with "Flowers in the Attic" or "My Sweet Audrina."  Typically speaking, you don't want to be a VC Andrews' parent.  Selling children ("Heaven" and "Ruby"), locking them in attics ("Flowers in the Attic") or lying to them about their entire existence ("My Sweet Audrina")...these are not respectable qualities.  However, in many VC books the parents aren't perfect but they are far from abusive.

"Celeste" takes back to a family we are glad we don't live in rather than a family that may be like our own.  Celeste's mother is a loner to the point of making the children into loner's.  She homeschools them and they go with her maybe once a month to town.  When the father dies the mother really goes off the deep end and when the twin boy dies the mother cannot accept the grief and twists things to the point of making Celeste act and talk like a boy and she dresses Noble in Celeste's clothes and buries him with all Celeste's things and holds a funeral, all the time claiming it is Celeste in the grave and not Nobel.

If you haven't read a VC book in awhile then this is the one to pick back up, or if you are new to the world of VC then this is a good book to start with
