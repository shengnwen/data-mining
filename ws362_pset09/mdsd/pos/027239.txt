Poker is pure Americana, as is Las Vegas, the setting of James McManus's non fiction memoir of murder and gambling.

This is one of the oddest books I've ever read. It's a reporter's memoir on a double assignment he received in 2000 from Harper's magazine. McManus was to cover the World Series of Poker, focusing on the increased prominence of women players. At the same time he was to follow the denouement of the murder trial of the event's manager, Ted Binion, killed two years before by his girlfriend. Or by a self-administered overdose?

But McManus isn't some two-bit scandal sheet reporter. He's a professor of literature. He's an ageing child of the sixties who managed to live fast without dying young, but not for lack of trying. He grew into the American dream of a mortgage and 2.5 kids and with a wife who looks hotter than the topless-dancer-accused-murderess, which we can check since the wife's picture opens chapter two. There's more. 

Why sit on the sidelines when he can enter the World Series himself by using Harper's $4000 advance to pay his entry fee. Ethical? Well he told Harper's and his wife. So he competes against 532 players from all over the world and ends up at the final table of six.   

McManus writes narcissistic prose, yet he's humble throughout. He dresses the text up with vignettes of famous poker players like Annie Duke and T.J. Cloutier, against whom he ranks himself no higher than an amateur, he thanks his wife and kids and his luck. He takes us on the two week rollercoaster ride he took, with all its emotional ups and downs. Loads of fun.
