The book has some good pictures and some good information, but some is contradictory. For example, if you buy premium cat food your paying for advertising, etc., but the next sentence reads that when buying cat food, you get what you pay for. Confusing.  Otherwise the book tells the positives of owning a Bengal, not the drawbacks
