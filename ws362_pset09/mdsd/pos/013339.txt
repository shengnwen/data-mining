The beginning of the book was excellent and then it tapered off towards the end. The House on Hope St, has tones of her earlier and much superior book &quot;Accident&quot;, which I highly recommend. Pick it up for a good read, but realize as soon as she enters the relationship with the doctor, everything is textbook romance
