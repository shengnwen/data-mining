This is the most beautiful western novel you'll ever read.  It is centered around the hero of the book, Shane.  He is the most beautiful, awesome man you'll ever know.  He leaves a delicate impact on the family he visits, and he will leave one on you, too.  I was touched.  The end could make you sad.  But it's still worth it
