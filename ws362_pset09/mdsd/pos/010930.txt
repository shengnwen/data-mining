I use this text to teach speech. It is a very good, systematic look at creating and delivering a speech. The system is great and the presentation is great.

However, you may be irritated like I am that the examples of mistakes are overwhelmingly made by males, who don't hold PC views, such as the business man who makes a big deal, the student who questions global warming theory, the student who doesn't want to attend the anti-war talk, the library volunteer who goes to church. While Lucas can't directly attack their positions, when he needs an example of a speech mistake, these are the people he chooses. It definitely detracts from an otherwise flawless book, especially when he is so preachy about respecting other viewpoints
