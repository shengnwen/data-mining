This book is a meditative mystery which serves as a vehicle for Crombie to muse on how tragedy is often determined by choices in the distant past. She deftly weaves together the experiences of the hero and the murdered in a way that makes a tapestry of shared experience. 

Crombie writes with solid skill and admirably crafted characters. If AJTIN has a flaw, it's in the predictability of the ending and the feeling that the plot is twisted to make a point. But this is really a minor flaw-- recommended for fans of British procedurals and of mystery novels in general
