Graphic novels seem to be quite the hot ticket.  While most traditional English teachers would scoff at this genre as a serious direction for students, I find my at-risk pupils captivated by the entire process.  Graphic novels help me keep their focus...I don't have them read too many, but I try to get them to write for me in graphic novel form.  Some of them are unbelievably gifted, and I want them to see this as a viable avenue for themselves.  I have a group of 4-5 who fight over this book regularly
