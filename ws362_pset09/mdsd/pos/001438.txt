It is usually quite difficult to find a good How-To book in the Infographics/Instructional Design arena. So, I was quite delighted to discover this book by Dr Ruth Clark and another book (Creating Graphics for Learning and Performance : Lessons in Visual Literacy) by Dr Linda Lohr.

I have found these information very useful:
- 7 communication functions of graphics (decorative, representational, mnemonic, organizational, relational, transformational, interpretive)
- mapping of appropriate graphical functions (or types) to different content types (facts, concepts, processes, procedures, principles)
- numerous graphical examples for different content types 
- numerous instructional design tips, e.g., chunking and sequencing to minimizing memory load, use of visual cues to direct attention, use of certain graphic types to build mental models (e.g., cause and effect)

What would have been even more useful could be the setup of an online Infographic Design resource where members of the public can collaboratively view, discuss and refine the guidelines, use and contribute more examples (especially), etc. Would certainly look forward to be involved in such an endeavor
