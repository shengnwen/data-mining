'Surfing Through Hyperspace' by Clifford Pickover is an engaging presentation of highly theoretical concepts within the field of physics presented in the form of a cosmic dectective story. The premise: "Hyperbeings have kidnapped the president!"

Question: Just how do 3-dimensional humans go about tracking down 4-dimensional hyperbeings and would we even be able to recognize them if we found them?

Who could resist a book with such chapter titles as; The Divinity of Higher Dimensions, Satan and Perpendicular Worlds and The Gods of Hyperspace. Wonderfully inventive, theologically challenging and just plain enjoyable!
