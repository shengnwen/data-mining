Running with Scissors gives the reader a humorous look at a childhood that at times will make your jaw drop.  Augusten's writing style is smooth and vivid (not to mention at times, absolutely wonderfully hilarious in his delivery).

I've read several of the reviews here, and they seem very mixed.  Here's my advice:

If you can sit down with a good, well written book who's content and subject matter are fascinating in its non-convention, pee your pants funny yet at the same time, jaw to the floor shocking with its characters and events; then you're the type to appreciate a novel or memoir of such taste.  And this is a must read!

If not, then my advice would be to move on and look for something else.

Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I sat down with it, and only moved for bathroom breaks until the very end.  I'd advise anyone planning to read this book to prepare for the same.

I will definitely be picking up some of Augusten's other novels in the future.

Thanks Augusten!  What a great memoir
