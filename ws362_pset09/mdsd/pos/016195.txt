The author lost Matthew Shepard; he doesn't appear in the book, and neither does his murder.  He is a ghost.  Which is a true shame.  Most of the book is softly pitched post-modern pyrotechnics.  Loffreda avoids the hard questions, and omits crucial information to understanding what happened that cold, cold night.  Loffreda dodges the role religion played in Matt's murder.  One of Matt's killers was an Eagle Scout and an elder in the Mormon church.  Also Loffreda makes a great deal about the fact that the killers attacked two latinos after killing Matt, as if racism is tied to homophobia.  We aren't told that the latinos were homophobic thugs themselves, out slashing tires and looking for trouble.  This book isn't about Matthew or even his murder, but if you can get past the author's sideways approach to the subject of homophobia it is a worthwhile read
