Written many years after the fact, this book is well worth reading many years after the fact.  Kingbird Highway is an autobiography, a travelogue, and a `where-to-bird' guide for 1973.  It is a tale of life, liberty, and the pursuit of birds.  Kingbird, alias Kenn Kaufman drops out of high school to pursue his dream (obsession) of seeing more birds in a single year than anyone had ever seen before.  There are several catches to his liberty and pursuit of birds.  He must see the birds north of Mexico, a technicality that affects his dream.  He has almost no money, so he does cheapest Big Year ever with the lowest dollar to bird ratio ever. He spends only about $1000 by hitchhiking everywhere and living off Little Friskies in a can of cold soup for dinner.   Kingbird Highway provides a wonderful map of where to bird even now over forty years later.  For example, the Brownville Texas Municipal dump is still the place to see Tamaulipas crows.  Read in conjunction with a field guide, Kingbird Highway opens a world of birds, their habits, and habitats that might otherwise escape notice.
