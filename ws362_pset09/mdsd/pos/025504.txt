It's tough to think of Palace of Desire as a stand-alone book.  It wouldn't make any sense outside of the context of the trilogy that it's a part of.  A reader would be lost if he simply picked this off the shelf and started reading without having read Palace Walk.  And likewise, you would feel unsatisfied if you stopped at the end of this book instead of continuing on with the final installment of the trilogy.

Of course, no one (least of all the author) would argue that point.  This was all meant to be one book from the start, and that's pretty obvious.  But since there aren't all that many people out there with the patience to read an eleven-hundred-page book....well, that's why this is three books and not one huge one.

Part two of the trilogy is just as fascinating as part one.  Each of the characters is up to his same old tricks.  Yasin is getting married, and divorced, and married again, and still visiting prostitutes - sometimes the same ones that his dad is visiting.  Kamal is enrolling in the Teachers' School, against his father's wishes, and starting to lose his faith in religion as he learns more about science, philosophy, and the world around him.  And throughout it all, Egypt is portrayed as a country very much in transition.  The traditional elements of society are precariously juxtaposed against the liberal forces of change.  And this inevitably causes sparks to fly.

It's easy to see why Mahfouz was awarded the Nobel Prize.  He's more than just a great writer; he's also an eloquent voice speaking on behalf of a fascinating country in a fascinating time.
