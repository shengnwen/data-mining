I loved this book and went through it in about a day or so. I think this is my favorite King book, and it moved me in the same way Rose Madder did. Having also read different books like Desperation, King's stories like this show his range and I am always eager to get into almost anything he has written. Also, the movie after this book was also very good and is one of my favorite movies.
