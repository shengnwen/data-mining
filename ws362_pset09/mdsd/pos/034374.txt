I'm amused by the comments that Ruth Benedict is outdated. No doubt she is--but where else will you learn about the philosophy of the Japanese armed forces in WWII? If you want to know why the Japanese treated their captives with such savagery, and why they routinely fought to the death, you'll benefit from reading this book. I don't know of any other that even attempts to explain these mysteries
