I purchased Officepolitics after reading Don's other books HOW TO DATE YOUNG WOMEN version one and two(advanced skills).  
I originally purchased HTDYW v1 after working in an office with 95% young women and it blew me away about their thinking, attitude etc so I researched some online bookstores and purchased a number of books mainly on understanding young chicks and HTDYW v1 was one of them after reading all these books I realised how brutally true HTDYW was, and how much rubbish the other three books were. OFFICEPOLITICS was written for women but both sexes can benefit from reading about life in the corporation and how to deal with bosses, co-workers, personnel staff for both new entrants into the work force and those considering changing jobs or career paths. The book is brutally honest as were Don's other books, for those that have exerienced some of the circumstances that is covered you will relate and find very amusing.
The book was written in 1994 so it needs updating but overall it is still relevent to todays workforce.
WARNING DON WILL TRY TO GET YOU TO SIGN UP FOR HIS COURSES / DISCUSSION GROUP DONT BOTHER THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.
