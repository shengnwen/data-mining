Rarely do I read a children's book that makes me laugh out loud, but this one did.  It's also a heck of a lot more fun reading a book to a child that makes you react that way, because they will enjoy it so much more.

This is a very clever book that contains more funny situations than some of the other garbage that is produced for kids.  

BUY THIS BOOK for kids 3-8.  It's worth every penny.
