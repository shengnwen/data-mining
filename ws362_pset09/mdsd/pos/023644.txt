I highly recommend this book if you have an interest in magicalhistory. Bamberg not only relates his personal experience with manygreats (family friend of Houdini, Thurston, Okito) but has a wonderful storytelling style.  He was quite a character with an amazing life story to share. At times, i found myself laughing out loud. The book beat all of my expectations and is highly recommended
