This novel is uninhibited, free from the drabness of half-hearted optimism, and pure in a way that a child experiences things; Spoken about excitedly, insightfully, and free from unnecessary fluff and good manners.  It paints very delicate portraits of women in as objective a way is it can, when our protagonist is a bitter, 55 year old alcoholic in the 70's.  Rarely do I ever read a book that makes me laugh out loud in public.

I prefer Bukowski's Short Stories and Letters to his novels, and I will tell you why.  The reason I don't give this book 5 stars is because with short stories, you don't necessarily need a beginning and an end.  If you were to cut out the last 15-20 pages of the book, you would basically have short stories.  The author in his masterful way of ending novels, skimps a bit on this one and leaves the ending as if the previous experiences with women were something that built up to some kind of metamorphosis.  However, the end comes out inneffectual at best, regardless of its eloquence.

I still recommend it, but I would advise the reader to approach it as a series of short stories that have a chronology instead of a novel that has a beginning, and a conclusion.  It was written for our personal amusement/bewilderment, as well as Bukowski's, and the rest is up to you to decide
