Many people dislike this book.  Heinlein rambles, he tells a series of stories with an overarching story tying them together and the book has several hundred pages of conversation between characters that love to use pet names for each other.  The book ask that you come to love the main characters despite (perhaps even because of) their willingness to violate the most basic taboos known to man and well suffice it to say that this book contains a lot of things people hate to see in a book.  None of that matters.  If you are the sort of person that doesn't mind reading a long book, believes that social conventions are not laws of nature, and is empathetic, you will be deeply moved by Time Enough for Love
