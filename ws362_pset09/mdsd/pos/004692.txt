Sedaris' Naked is a quick, enjoyable read. The honesty and incisiveness he uses to portray his family members is excellent, although the accompanying cruelness from such honesty can be off-putting. Some of his essays, such as c.o.g., about his experiences as an apple-picker and then an Oregon-shaped clock maker's assistant who declares Sedaris to be a 'child of god' are both hilarious and incisive. However, other essays, while humorous, are largely forgettable. Looking back through the book I found essays that I barely remembered even though I had read them only days before. Sure, they were funny at the time, but a lot of them lack impact. However, when Sedaris is on, he is on, and some of his stories, such as his description of his grandmother, Ya-Ya, his attempt at being a childhood detective to clear his name, and his visit to a nudist colony, are both funny and memorable. It's these kind of essays that make the book really worth reading.
