I have quite an extensive collection of "Art of" and "Making of" movie books but I have to say, this one is the most fun out of them all! Yes, it has all the things that went into the making of the movie, such as preproduction artwork, models, all the things you'd expect to find in a "Art of" book but it's also packed with an ample supply of extras, such as real post-it notes, trading cards, various booklets... it took me a while just to go through all the little extras. A nice surprise!

If you enjoyed the movie and like these type books, then you'll LOVE this one
