My husband purchased this book for me and WOW!  It is packed with information regarding the common bond that women had in fellowshipping, politicking, raising money for war efforts, changing society, gaining strength to have a voice, comforting others ...all through their domestic art of quilting.  A must for quilters and for anyone who has a tendency to believe that domesticity disables one from being active to change society for the good of everyone
