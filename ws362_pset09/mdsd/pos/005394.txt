Strobel writes in such a way that makes it fun to read. And in this book, written in the same format at The Case for Faith and The Case for Christ, he interviews important scientists on the issue of Evolution vs. Design. One argument one might use against him is that he is a Christian and that the arguments he produces are Straw Men. But I don't think this is really applicable because he raises some pretty strong objections with the gentlemen he is interviewing. The material is not simple to grasp (I thought Faith and Christ books were simpler), but the issues are definitely turned up a notch. So you will need to brush up on some of your science to keep pace, but the work is worth it. Of course, there are a slew of other books you could also look at to better understand the issue. I believe that, as more evidence is produced, the ID folks will continue to gain respect everywhere, including the scientific community. This information is important if we hope to have answers for a world that is asking questions
