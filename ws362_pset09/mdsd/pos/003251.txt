I think this book is right on.  I have had chronic back pain for years and every doctor tells me it is in my head, or I need physical therapy.  If I could do the exercises they want you to do in therapy, I would nt need a doctor.  The worst thing is finding someone to believe you and who is willing to do all that is possible to help. Doctors are too quick to just blow you off when it comes to chronic pain
