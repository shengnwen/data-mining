Of course with a wordless book a story can take many directions.  This story is a simple tale about an old woman with single-minded determination for...pancakes.  Her trials and tribulations about getting pancake ingredients on her farm and ultimate failure at the hands of her dog and cat ends with her "following her nose" to the neighbor's house where the pancakes are just coming off the griddle.

Good to read to 18 months and older.  Of course, its the skill of the reader that makes this fun.  If one doesn't approach it with creativity and flair, it'll be flatter...than a pancake
