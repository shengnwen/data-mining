The Perricone perscription offers a fresh approach to healthy eating. I found that my skin did get healthier, and since the skin is a mirror on the inside of my body, I know that the program is healthy.  I read about how inflamation is at the root of many diseases, and this diet really reduces inflamation in the body.  I also lost weight on it.  The diet certainly gives a lot of food choices in the fruit and vegetable catagories, but will not work for anyone who does not like seafood.
