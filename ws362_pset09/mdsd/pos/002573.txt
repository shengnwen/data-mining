This book is great for people who want to learn the basics of different  trees, their leaves, their twigs and bark of the trees around their area.  If you don't know if the tree grows in your area, you can look at the maps  in the book to see if it does. If you like trees and want to learn about  them, you'll love this book. I loved this book because it built my  foundation for knowledge in trees and their different families
