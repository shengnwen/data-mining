After having read 5 of Ross Thomas' books, I keep picking up another one.  He writes with such style and wit that one wishes one could meet the characters.  But perhaps they would be just too cool for us regular folks. His male characters are smart and well-dressed and tough.  His female characters are smart and well-dressed and tough. "Ah, Treachery!" is an excellent story about intrigue and the US military and second chances and revenge and impeccable taste in dress and getting the girl. 

Read a Ross Thomas novel.  You won't regret it.
