While other people have complained about the lack of text in this book, I found it refreshing. It was nice to evaluate these rarely seen drawings (in high quality reproductions) on my own. The thumbnail reference page in the back is also a nice design idea. This book might serve as a nice companion to either the MCA catalouge or the Rosenblum book
