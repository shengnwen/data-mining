I am really enjoying this book. I chose to read it because I find myself giving too much to others and leaving nothing for myself. The book has a short introduction section and is divided up into seasons so you don't read it all at once, but is a journey to be taken over a course of a year. I found that to be a comfort because I wasn't sure how a book was going to teach me to change myself overnight. It also encourages you to read only relative topics, which is great to really personalize and focus in on your own needs
