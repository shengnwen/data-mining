This outline covers just about all of the applied mathematics that upper level undergraduate and graduate engineers need to know to solve problems. It is a great reference, but its scope is so broad that you really can't use it for anything other than review. The author apparently recognizes that an outline this broad in scope cannot be that instructive either, and limits the introductory portion of each chapter to relevant tables and equations that an engineer/scientist must know to work problems. It is assumed you have other books to function as detailed tutorials. I have to say that the differential equations portions of this outline were far superior to the individual Schaum's outlines for those subjects. Also, the Fourier series and Fourier integral chapters were a bit too theoretical for most engineers, as many of the problems involved proofs or demonstrating properties rather than using the theory to solve problems. However, most chapters have a good mix of exercises - a few proofs, straight numerical problems, and applied exercises such as problems on circuit analysis, for example. 

If you need a broad overview of the mathematics that an engineer must know from a problem-solving perspective, with small lessons on each topic, might I also suggest "Engineering Mathematics" and "Advanced Engineering Mathematics" by Stroud. Both of those books lead you by the hand and cover everything from high school through graduate school-level mathematics from an engineer's perspective. This outline would go great with those two books, as this outline can serve as a test of your comprehension of those two books by serving as a source of additional solved problems. I would suggest you get this book and keep it around as one of several good references on applied mathematics
