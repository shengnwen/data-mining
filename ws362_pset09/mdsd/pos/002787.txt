  This book is awesome! One thing I loved about this book is,it really makes you think about life in middle school and what you go through. This book is about two girls running for president. One is a pop which in this book means popular. The other is just a normal 6th grader.If you like books with 6th grade drama, you will love this book. I would not recommend this book, if you like romance or mystery.  I loved this book and I hope you will to
