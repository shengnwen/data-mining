If you want to know about baseball, this is the one book you MUST read.  From the early days of robber-baron owners, to the formation of the most powerful union in the world, this book tells it all in great detail.  I cannot recommend it enough to fans of the game as well as anyone interested in the history of business in America.  It has been said that to know the history of America, you must know the history of baseball.  This book exemplifies that thought.  Its out of print, but try as hard as you can to find a copy.  You will not be dissapointed
