     Ok, I'll break from the pack and say I really like this book.  As previously mentioned, it's actually a collection of older articles from Fine HomeBuilding.  I bought the book many years back, when I first started to develop an interest in architecture.  My architectural library has now outgrown a medium-sized bookcase, and I've even designed and built several houses.  Nonetheless, I still find myself coming back to the articles in this modest book.

     Go forewarned - this collection does not focus purely on craftsman bungalows.  Instead, the theme tying these articles together is a craftsman-like approach toward design, materials, and building.  There are indeed some true Arts and Crafts treasures highlighted, like the Bolton house by Greene & Greene.  Others though have a somewhat modern feel about them.  Others still...well...we won't go there.

     I must say that even the articles about houses that I don't care for offered up something of value.  Sometimes this is just a clever detail or use of material.  My favorite article is the Greene and Greene inspired home by Rodger Whipple.  This showed me how heavy timber could be elegantly integrated with conventional modern stick framing.  I'd never seen this done so well and this little article heavily influenced the direction I took with my own work.

     Don't write this one off - I consider it a hidden gem.
