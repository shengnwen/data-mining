I've enjoyed Robert Parker's fiction for many years now and it still entertains. He aspires to offer some wisdom along with the story and that is also fairly enjoyable. True, sometimes what he brings forth as deep psychological truth is actually pretty ordinary, but then most truth is. I long for him to undiscover psychology and discover other sources of wisdom. But you can't have everything. This particular book is up to his usual standards of clear, concise prose
