After reading The Handmaid's Tale and loving it, I decided to delve into The Blind Assassin.  I must admit I had a very difficult time getting into the book, with such a vague beginning, and then being further confused with excerpts from The Blind Assassin, and various newspaper clippings that Iris herself keeps.  I read about 130 pages and still debated putting this book down for something else a bit lighter.  This is a dark novel and I agree with other reviews here that Atwood's characters are not loveable or easy to identify with.  But, this novel isn't about finding a story you can sympathize with.  As you get into the story a bit more, you discover the hidden connections and secrets of the plot. This book will pull you in, and it will challenge you to open your mind to a new form of literature  It is the postmodern metafiction that makes this book great.  It's the type of book you'll have to read slowly, reviewing pages you've already read to fully understand the connections and themes drawn between the three ongoing tales, and maybe have to read for a second time to really appreciate Atwood's talent.  If this review seems vague, its because the book is so difficult to pin down.  Atwood weaves a great postmodern work of fiction that is complex.   I dont think every reader will enjoy or appreciate it, with its dark characters and plot.  But, if you really want a read that will challenge you, this is a great choice
