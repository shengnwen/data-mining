Originally published in 1983, Fred Schodt's re-released Manga! Manga! is an improvement on an already stellar work. Schodt is a translator, writer, and critic on things Japanese-in particular manga. He writes in a fluent, articulate style that will persuade even the conservative high culture guardians that manga (and anime) belongs along with Kabuki and Noh and flower arrangement in the pantheon of great Japanese cultural gifts to the world. Manga! Manga! is meticulously researched and leavened with anecdotes from Schodt's many years in Japan.
When the first edition appeared, some twenty years ago, outside of Japan few even knew what manga was. Manga today is a major industry. In 1996, some 2.3 billion magazines were being churned out-or 40% of all publications in highly literate Japan. Adults are now being targeted with more plot-driven manga, and its export to Asia, Europe, and the US can be counted as one of Japan's great "industrial" success stories.
This version has been revised but retains the best of the 1983 section. Following an introduction by Osamu Tezuka, Schodt delves into the history of manga in a section that covers a thousand years of Japanese pictorial history. This includes native traditions, foreign influence, the War years, and more. The text then moves onto chapters on types of manga: samurai, women-centric, business, erotic. The last two chapters feature a behind-the-scenes look at those who produce the manga, and then an essay on the future of manga. At the end of the book are samples from four titans of manga-Osamu Tezuka, Reiji Matsumoto, Riyoko Ikeda, and Keiji Nakazawa.
Excellent. A great, great read
