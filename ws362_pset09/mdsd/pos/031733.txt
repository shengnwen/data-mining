There is nobody, and I mean nobody who writes this genre better than Connelly.  He doesn't muck up Bosch's life with unrealistic actions or relationships.  I thought he was coming too close to it with Walling, but thankfully he let Bosch be who he really is...a flawed man, an honorable yet somewhat unhonorable cop, and a great detective.  I was glad it was nearly pure storyline, without the ex-wife and daughter present as well. I don't want to see Connelly take Bosch the Lucas Davenport route.  

The story is one that at the beginning just eats at a mother (me) - a child killed and the killer never found.  One could absorb the frustration Bosch had felt throughout the long years of  the investigation.  The emotional tragedy he felt.  It was compelling.

Connelly is the best of anyone at capturing the essence of personalities of the different policemen who deal with Harry. Nakamura was a photograph to me by the time Connelly gets through with him. All the characters are sparingly, yet very effectively drawn. I love that about Connelly. And again, the political life of being a cop is revealed.

This is a really, really, really good book.  I would have given it 4-1/2 stars because I found the lead-up to the end just a tad overdone and a bit unbelievable maybe (the cops not imagining the restroom scene happening), but I was fascinated with this book the entire time I was listening.

I can't wait to meet Bosch again
