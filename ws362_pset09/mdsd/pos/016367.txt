`Lawrence of Arabia's' oddly-titled book is a worthy read that most people know by the stunning movie that made its central figure a household name. Before or after seeing the movie, this intriguing written chronicle of T.E. Lawrence's efforts to mold the Arabs of the Hejaz (part of today's Saudi Arabia) into a force that would throw off yoke of the Ottoman Turks and so break the weakest link of the First World War's Central Powers offers a beguiling peak into the mind of one of the twentieth century's most enigmatic figures.

We may never know how much of Lawrence's description of his outsider-insider role among the desert Arabs reflects fact and how much is fiction. No matter. He has written a fine piece of literature even if one grants him only the most tenuous link with events as they happened. This reviewer tends to concede Lawrence rather more than the minimum, as to find a little too detailed the revisionist literature that casts him in bohemian post.

Recent East-meets-West events in the Middle East lend Seven Pillars an aspect of d�j� vu. Nine decades before American Special Forces were organizing the Kurds to harass the Baghdad government, Lawrence was working in an unofficial theatre of Britain's Mediterranean war, prodding the quarrelsome tribes to rise up in a sufficiently organized manner so as to break the Ottoman Empire's southeastern front and ease General Allenby's march through Palestine and Syria.

Then as too recently in our time, promises made by the regnant empire were not kept after the important risks had been taken. The Arabs got Damascus' glories back from the Turks and relegated that empire to relative obscurity. However, for reasons that had as much to do with lack of political vision among Arab leaders as with promises that Britain had made to Europe's Jews in its Balfourian moment and jostling by Britain and France for Middle Eastern supremacy, the Arabs never fulfilled the grand vision of pan-Arab unity and self-determination.

Lawrence claims to know that they never would. So, the reticence he feels about his `great fraud' grows as the Arab revolt accumulates victories even as it becomes ever more clear that they would not become more than convenient ancillaries of the victorious Brits.

In the midst of these geopolitical abstractions, Lawrence writes poignantly of those Arabs who have become his fellow travelers. Never quite becoming one of them, he nonetheless depicts his extraordinary role as a quasi-Westerner among them. Readers who have found some such entrance into an adoptive culture will both grimace and chuckle at the author's ironic comments upon the occasional British comrade-in-arms who joins him in the desert without exercising his ability to understand that the Arabs are his hosts rather than his subjects.

At a time when Western men in arms and men in armchairs--not to mention women in both--need as much as ever to comprehend that they are not the first to sketch out a future for the Arabs, Lawrence's classic is worth a dust-off and an enjoyable read. The news or your Arabic-speaking neighbor may look different when you lay down Seven Pillars--whatever its proportions of fact and fiction--and focus again
