Moderately amusing collection of 33 articles culled from various magazines and newspapers. Many of these are interviews with authors like John Updike, Salman Rushdie, and other such literary luminaries. While these are likely  of interest to the well-read, I found the more entertaining essays to be  the non-interviews. In this vein are those railing on Republican politics,  the darts scene, judging a short story competition, the Frankfurt Book  Fair, an English soccer team's tour of China, and playing pool with a good  friend. The essays are all fairly short, so it's a good book to pick up and  put down constantly
