First and foremost, James Hillman is a &quot;Champion of Soul,&quot; responding appropriately to the everlasting question: &quot;What is a man profited if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?&quot; How is one  to &quot;retrieve his/her soul?&quot;  Obviously, we need help to do so;  hence, Jung and Hillman, and others, such as Marion Woodman, not to mention  Joseph Campbell, William Blake, Robert Graves.  One might even gain great  insight from reading M. Esther Harding's classic: WOMEN'S MYSTERIES. They  all come together eventually for the serious soulseeker.  To sum up,  quoting Hillman, &quot;Dreams mean well by us,&quot; in spite of their  appearance to the contrary; they are designed to dissolve the interfering  Ego, the Ego that would deprive you of your true Happiness
