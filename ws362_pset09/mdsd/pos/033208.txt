I can't help but express my disapproval at how a review from 2000, which rated this book one star, is a spotlight review. 

This reader failed to realize that this book wasn't written for people who are already organized or know the "common sense" things for organization. If organization was that "common sense," more people would be able to get their lives together instantaneously.

Morgenstern builds upon her previous best-seller hit, "Organizing from the Inside Out." For people who have read that book, I would agree that "Time Management" does not offer much else in addition to it. However, "Time Management" stands on its own on the reader from 2000 who gave it one star failed to recognize that this book stands on its own apart from her debut. 

A few choice tips that I have found to have helped me:
- Estimate time for big projects: Most people underestimate the time it takes them to do things. It's better to overestimate or get as accurate a time frame as possible. If you overestimate, at least you'll have time to do other things; if you underestimate, you'll feel rushed and like you never have time for anything.

- The WADE formula: Readers of "Organizing from the Inside Out" know this formula well. 
WRITE IT DOWN: Record your tasks in a planner or one area.
ADD IT UP: Estimate how long your projects will take.
DECIDE what you will do: delay, delegate, delete or diminish tasks.
EXECUTE YOUR PLAN: Put your plan into action.

- Doing things faster: Pages 69-75 offer great tips for getting things done faster to save YOU time:
- Order groceries online
- Hire someone to clean if you don't have time to do it yourself
- Pay bills online and do it once or twice a month
- Lay out clothes the night before
- Send virtual greeting cards
(While many of the above tips are common sense, many people are disorganized need a gentle reminder - or a swift kick in the you know where - to do many of the easy-to-overlook things.)

- Ten Questions to decide on whether to keep a document or paper

- Set aside daily time to process paperworl

- Compartmentalize your life into six main categories that focus on your "big picture goals" (main things you want to achieve in life). Now, break your life up into smaller pieces to work your way toward those goals.

If you found the sampling above helpful, I'd recommend that you purchase this book. "Do not stop, do not collect $200!" If the above was not (somewhat) helpful to you at all, you'd probably be best skipping this book - or you're already organized and don't need it
