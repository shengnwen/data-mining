I got this book to see if my 9-year-old could use it but as it turned out, the book is more suitable for me than it is for her.  It is a great way to build one's vocabulary (I am learning quite a few new words myself) but it does take some discipline, and is certainly a bit too advanced for my daughter.  If Mark Philips could also include the pronunciation in the footnotes, that would be even better.
Note:  this is not the origianl Wizard of Oz story, a point about which I am a little disappointed.  A great vocab book nonetheless
