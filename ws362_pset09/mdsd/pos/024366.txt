Joe Namath-a man that conjures an image that few people in this world could ever match.   Although this book tends to be a bit of a long read and gossipy at times, it provides some real insight into the life and legend of a hero to many and a bad influence to others. Mark Kriegel does a thorough job in helping us visualize the complexities of a man who always seems to live a life of extremes.  

Being in my early 40's and having grown up in Alabama as a Crimson Tide fan, I have always been enamored with the legend of Joe Namath playing for Coach Bryant.  I also have some memories of him as a kid quarterbacking the Jets and seeing some of his commercials years ago as well as his appearances on television. I was probably more like one of the Ovaltine kids that Kriegel mentions.  

This book helped me to see the whole picture of the life of Joe Namath; a very private man living a very public life.  I found myself sickened at times by his lifestyle and his mannerisms, yet the book has a way of making your dark side revel in it sometimes.   All the while, I found myself uplifted by this never say quit attitude and his ability to fight through the pain. This book is well worth reading as it will stir the full range of your emotions.

I doubt I will ever understand the complex life of Joe Namath, but I still love seeing him on the sidelines at Alabama games and hope that the rest of this life will be one of peace, reconciliation, and fulfillment.
