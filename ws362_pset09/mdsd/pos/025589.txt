 This is as it states for the Novice to the Professional and that is completely true.

and a reference for the professional to turn to again and again. 
    The foundation of the web is simple database back ends and interactive web page front ends. 
MySQL is an Internet standard back end database and it's ease of use combined with the power of PHP
make the 2 a great combination to construct web databases easily and powerfully. 
    Gilmore guides the reader step by step from installation to basic functions, and finally to practical uses
for PHP and MySQL. 
    But wait a minute, Gilmore adds two more things. He sneaks small chapters in the middle of his book on 
SqlLite and PDO.  For those thinking that MySQL is a bit too much for their small project then turn to SqLite. 
Gilmore explains how to install and use SqLite quickly.  If you are a programmer and are familuar with using
Microsoft's ADO for database connections, then you can turn to PDO (PHP Dataobjects). PDO provides the
power and simplicity to connect to various databases that you may have at your disposal. 
    One of the great sections in the book is Gilmore's explanation of how to do Object Orientated Programing
in PHP. Starting with PHP 5 you can harness the power of PHP to deal with you program objectively.  Object
Orientated Programming is mentally the way to go as you can plan, organize, and assemble your code logically. 
    Other chapters of interest include how to effectively use Arrays, Authentication, File Uploads, PHP and LDAP,
Secure PHP, Securing MySQL, Practical Database Queries, and Importing and Exporting data. 
 
If you do any work with PHP at all, be sure to check out this book. It will pay for itself in full.
