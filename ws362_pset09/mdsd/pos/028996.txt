Liddell Hart's powers of analysis are put to full use in this book.  He offers a coherent and engrossing account of the Second World War.  His organization and style make reading the book a delight.  Nevertheless, this book is still inferior to its predecessor, the History of the First World War written and published almost 50 years before this volume saw the light of day.  Captain Liddell Hart's strategic insights are informative especially because much of what happened in WW2 was in keeping with his own predictions before the war.  However, he sometimes shows a lack of appreciation for political and tactical details, such as his treatment of the dropping of atomic bombs.  He turns that issue into a very clear-cut, unnecessary, morally reprehensible action, but his argument never expands much beyond editorialization.  Regardless of the reader's own opinion on the atomic bomb, enough work has been done by other authors since the 1970s to make the historical verdict far more complex than Liddell Hart argues.  Otherwise, an excellent book
