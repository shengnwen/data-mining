	While reading Anita Brookner's "Making Things Better," the notion of T.S. Eliot's poem, "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," kept vying for attention.  Especially the line, "Do I dare to eat a peach?"  The main character, Julius Herz, 73 and retired is Prufrock, the man who decides to forgo the peach.  The novel's third person point of view narrative deftly portrays Herz, especially his plagued inner life.  But often the reader is also privy to Herz's mental state through inner dialog, the occasional conversation with other characters and letters Herz pens.

	"Making Things Better" is one long lamentation and how things could have been better say this happened or this did not happen.  The pages are slow to turn at times since most of the action takes place within Herz's mental life.  His obsessions include a failed marriage with Josie, his declining health, an ill brother, Freddy, and Fanny Bauer, the woman he truly wanted to marry, but got away due to his timidness.  Brookner's authentic sentences capture the sadness of a man who realizes he did not truly live life, but skipped around its corners.

	But wait, there is hope on the horizon, hence the title of the book, "Making Things Better," a phrase often repeated by Herz.  He is seeking redemption; this is the impetus of the book that keeps one reading to see if he finally dares to eat a peach?
