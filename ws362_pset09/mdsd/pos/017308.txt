As other reviews note, this book is marred by some errors (e.g., it was not Grant who abrogated Kentucky's neutrality; most works I have read credit The Bishop General, Polk, with that accomplishment).  It also promises more in the subtitle than it can deliver ("The Friendship That Won the Civil War").  I just don't see the case made that their friendship led to victory.  It was hardly irrelevant, of course, but the subtitle's claim sets a high standard to meet.

However the performance of other generals, such as George Thomas, suggests that others could as well have been the hammer in the West after Grant's accession to control of all of the Union armies.  And Thomas' record before Sherman became the top general in the west could be said to be no worse than Sherman's (in fact, Buell's Warrior Generals argues that Thomas was one of the best of all Union generals and was never given full credit; while the argument is not, in the final analysis, fully convincing, one cannot downgrade Thomas' contributions to the North).

Many of the stories and events here are quite familiar to readers of Civil War history.  And there is rather less on the battlefield events than might have been called for.

Nonetheless, in the end, this is a good analysis of the friendship between Grant and Sherman and how it did help them to mesh their strategic efforts
