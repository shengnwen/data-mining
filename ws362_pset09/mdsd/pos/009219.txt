This book introduced me to Wally Lamb and I am looking forward to reading the rest of his work.  The book looks long, but the pages fly.  It only took me a week to read.  You will be introduced to so many memorable people that seem so human, it is hard to believe this book is fiction.  I can't say enough good things about this book, it is truely remarkable
