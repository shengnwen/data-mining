a friend of mine leant it to me.  Based on some of the reviews from the other adults on this site I was hesitant to read it.  However, I thought it was very well done and a great read and I'm 40+.  Can there be comparisons to LOTR?  Yes, most definitely.  But then again, if you look at any fantasy book you can find comparisons to LOTR.  Sure there are elves and dwarfs, but Stephen King even has Elves and Dwarfs in his book "Talisman", but I don't hear people comparing that to LOTR and there are no dragon riders in LOTR, that I can recall.
Anyway, if you're like I was and are sitting on the fence about reading this book take the leap and give it a try.  I really think you'll enjoy it and forget all this stuff about "it's well written for a 17 year old"...it's well written period
