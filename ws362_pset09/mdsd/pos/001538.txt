Anyone who has ever loved a drug addict or alcoholic will find a great deal of resonance in Anya Seton's powerful romantic novel "Dragonwyck." Miranda Wells, a young girl from a Connecticut farm family, finds herself in the world of old New York aristocracy, which is at first glamorous but becomes increasingly sinister and ugly as the veneer is stripped away. The confusion and torment of living with a man who loves his opium more than he loves her brings her to make some hard decisions, which in the end will save her sanity and her life. This is a very well-written novel about lost innocence and virtue regained through suffering. I loved this novel and highly recommend it
