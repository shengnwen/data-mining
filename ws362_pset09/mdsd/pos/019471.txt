Honestly, this is the best book i've ever read. It was my first Dean Koontz novel and I LOVED it. It was brilliant the way he twined his characters together in the suspenseful plot and I will definitely read more of his novels from my liking of this one. This book has inspired me to read again. Honestly, read it! it's Soooooooo good
