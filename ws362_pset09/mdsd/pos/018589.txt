I first read Leopold's "Almanac" in 1981 as part of my undergraduate studies in ecology and now as a teacher make it part of our class reading because of Leopold's artistic ability with diction. However,only when I received this latest edition as a gift from students did I realize how little I understood the beauty of Sand County; Michael Sewell walked Leopold's footsteps and captured in brilliant color the world of Wisconsin that so inspired this poetic icon. Perhaps the greatest gift I've ever received from students
