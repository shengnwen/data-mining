I read this book right when it was on the best sellers list. It took me a long time to read it, trying to decipher what was fictional, and what did make sense. 
     What makes sense:
       Information being withheld from the populace so they don't grow in        enlightenment.
       The possibility that the government has a machine that keeps vibrations lowered.

What was senseless was the boring plot filling in page after page, quite fictional in content, and filled with the authors egocentricities. 

       Remember, this was written before the Harry Potter books. It could have been a motivating factor for that author through this one. It does make one think on lines that is proper. For one, you do have a spiritual body, and it can advance through proper spiritual atonement. This author describes how vibrations affect our spiritual bodies!

       I'm grateful for this book because it helped many to realize these things which was not part of many individuals lives at that time. It sold millions of copies and that was a great beginning for advancing our society towards a more fulfilling and truthful spirituality. 

       Some people, not use to pets, should start with a goldfish, this book is the goldfish. Others who want to, or are ready for a bigger pet should read Quantum Success.
