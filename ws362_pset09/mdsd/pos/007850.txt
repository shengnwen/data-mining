Through this book, Josip Novakovich helps novice writers gain confidence, experience, and skill.  He does this not by coddling writers as if they were pre-school children palying at finger paints, but by making them work  hard to attain their goal. Although not all of the 200+ exercises  interested me, I found most of them to be interesting enough and several to  be quite engaging.  Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone  who wanted to write fiction but wasn't sure where to begin.  Also, it's a  good text for more advanced writers who have encountered that dreaded  ailment: writer's block
