I could not wait for the 2nd in this series and I was not disappointed.  I love the strength and determination of these characters, especially Judith.  Ms. Perry's descriptions are so good it is almost as if you are on the battlefield.  Her characters so well developed that you wish they truly existed.  Ms. Perry never fails to disappoint me.  With each novel and each new series, she surpasses herself
