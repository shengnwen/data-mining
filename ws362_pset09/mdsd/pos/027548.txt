I really appreciated the authors intent to discuss the atmosphere that leads America to war without playing the blame game.

There was a few times where I was moderately lost (momentarily) and it does well in explanation, but perhaps could be more in-depth (although I myself am incapable of even writing a book, so I won't blame the author for any shortcomings)
