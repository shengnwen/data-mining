We read this book as a part of our homeschool History curriculum this year.  It was very informative and entertaining. My children (ages 6 and 8) absolutely loved it.   We have the older version, and my kids didn't even mind the lack of color and the sparse illustrations.  They begged me ,"One more chapter...please, Mom?!"

I would say the only thing I did not care for in this book was the way they portray the Indians.  Other than Squanto, Samoset and Massasoit, all of the other Indians are viewed as 'savages' (and not very intelligent ones, at that.)   In the last few chapters, they are even used as 'comic relief.'   She also has them speaking the word 'Ugh' a lot...such as "Ugh! White squaw bring me cider!"
I thought that was a little unrealistic, and insulting as well.

The information on the Pilgrims is wonderful, and she really brought their journey alive.

If you can overlook the Indian parts, I would highly recommend this book.
