I came into the Jack Reacher game late, having started with 'One Shot' and Die Trying' both of which I thought were excellent thrillers. So, I decided to go back to the beginning and see how the series all started. It's a totally engrossing and enjoyable read, although it definitely feels like a first novel. Some of the situations are more than a tad convenient,one of which Jack Reacher even cops to. Still Child is at his best when he's tying the action up in the final fifty pages or so with heart pounding suspense that never lets up. If this is the first thing you're reading by Child, you should find it a better than average book for the genre, if you're a fan it's nice to see the genesis
