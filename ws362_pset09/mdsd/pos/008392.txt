This is one of the few Star Trek novels that was incredibly true to the spirit of both Roddenberry and the characters, while creating a situation where the reader can experience an old character in a new way. The chance to see Spock without his fear of getting too close to humans while still being intrinsicly himself really added new layers to the character without changing Spock at all. Of course, Barbara Hambly is an amazingly talented writer and almost everything she writes is fabulous in my book
