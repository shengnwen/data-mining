I just finished reading When The Road Turns, and found it to be inspirational and informative while maintaining some semblance of humor throughout.  I don't think you have to have MS to appreciate these people and to learn from their examples of how to live life beyond MS.  It is a wonderful insight into making the most of life and getting somewhere new by rediscovering ourselves.  Excellent
