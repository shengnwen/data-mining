I'm a brazilian, (unemployed) agronomist, single and 35 years old today.I read this book, here in Brazil, some years ago.It's a great book, both on size, as in ideas.It's now a little outdated.Some ideas of this book were crushed by recents arqueology's discoveries.
The core idea of this book is, that Western civilization, is a evolution of others civilizations.From Sumerian, to Europe, Western civilization was builted.Western civilization has some cultural advances ahead of all the rest of mankind.Such as freedom of conscience, science, religion's freedom, freedom and dignity of the individual,etc.Having this cultural(and even more religions) advantages, Western civilization got world dominance, against all the others civilizations (Islam, India, etc.).Writen in time, when be a marxist was seen as a cultural value, this book was ahead of the majority of scholars at his times.This book shows you a true:economic results depends of religion and cultural results who existed before.
Even with some failures and a little outdated, this book has a great value today.If you reaf the best-seller book "The Clash of Civilizations" you can see, that this book was (in ideas)the father of this modern best-seller.Being a brazilian, I should to tell you that Western civilization is the best civilization ever to exist in human history, and this book can tell you, why.
