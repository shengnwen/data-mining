  The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a great book "you read before bed". I would recommend this for ages 10+. You could also say that there are three different climaxes, in the beginning, middle, and end, so this is a long, detailed book. The plot is detailed and is a classic example of fantasy literature. The book starts at the house of Bilbo Bagins, which is in a place where houses are built in hills and the people are very short or hobbits. His peaceful life is shattered by a party of dwarves and a wizard who takes Bilbo on a adventure through the Misty Mountains: with cold winters and hordes of evil goblins, Mirkwood: a forest where giant spiders and bloodthirsty elves live, and last, the Lonely Mountain, where a great treasure is guarded by the dangerous dragon, Smaug. Soon a series of events lead to the ultimate treasure hunt for an unsuspecting Bilbo Bagins. But as interesting as the settings are, it is the characters that bring the reader inside the story.

   One of the main  characters is Bilbo Bagins. Bilbo is short so he is shy and wants to look big at times, yet he is shy in most other scenes. Gandalf is the wizard of the party and is the wisest. He saves the party many times and is a great negotiator. Thorin and the many other dwarves are the others in the party. They are seen as a bit short, fat, but strong warriors. Thorin and the other dwarves love the adventure and each one has unique traits that give the story a variety. Many of these characters bring the reader inside the story, and combined with the setting makes The Hobbit a classic fantasy.
