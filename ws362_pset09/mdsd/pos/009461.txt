Mr. Tyree I must say I have an addiction to reading. 
This novel was emotionally moving to me. I fell in love with John an his best friend Darin. It showed me not only the loyalty they had in one another as friends but they also loved one another like brothers.
 This was the first and only book so far that made me cry.
I  really wished  that John didn't have to die.

 GREAT READ OMAR.......KEEP UP THE GOOD WRITING...
