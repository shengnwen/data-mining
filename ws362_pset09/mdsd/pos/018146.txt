"Rivers' analysis of Sassoon's attitude towards the War shows Rivers the futility of Sassoon's protest. By refusing to participate in the War, Sassoon is not only breaking the oath he took when he entered the service, but because he is not serving, he is similar to the leaders and generals prolonging the War from afar."

Although Sassoon is technically breaking the oath he took when he entered the service by refusing to serve, this by no means places him parallel to the leaders and generals prolonging the war from afar.  Unlike those war officers, Sassoon feels an immense emotional connection to his men, which is a main driving force in his refusal to serve in the war any longer in the first place.  The oath that Sassoon has vowed to his men, therefore, a promise to protect them and to make sure they are safe, does not break during the novel because he is hoping to save their lives through his protest.  Causing Rivers, an extremely intelligent psychologist, to question the motives and direction of the war as well, Sassoon demonstrates his ability to cause those of authority to question the morality of the war as well.  In causing Rivers to question the reasons of the war effort, Sassoon provides the reader with concrete proof that his struggle is not futile.  

Sassoon is steadfast in his desire to return the front, being described as almost ecstatic to be returning to his men at the end of the novel.  Even though Sassoon's protest does not cause the war to end, he is still able to raise serious doubts about the sincerity of the war in Rivers' mind and is able to return to his men and resume fulfilling the physical aspect of his oath by protecting his men from bodily harm.
