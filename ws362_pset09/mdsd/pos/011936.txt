Mr. Daniele gives the beginner and the advanced wood worker designs to choose from in this beautifully done book.  His drawings, as always are well done. His other books, now out of print, are well priced collectors  items.  This book is also destined to become a sought after collectable.  Lets hope a new book is forth coming
