I first read this book as the chapbook series back in the mid 1990's and found it a pleasure and very easy to read these small books mainly because of their size (about 80 pages or so each) but very hard to put down.
By the time the movie was released I found myself watching in almost disbelief as to how closely the movie was made to the actual book.  Everything described in the book was almost the same image on the silver screen as to what appeared in my head when I was reading the chapbooks.....  I do enjoy watching the King movies based his other novels but find them all a bit dissapointing as to how badly they seem to be made. (expecially the endings!!!. But this book is a must read even if you don't enjoy horror books or have disliked Stephen King novels in the past as it is a big step sideways for this author and has an appeal to an even greater audience.  The hardcover came out just after the chapbook series and is a must to bring great character to your hardcover collection.
Thank
