I first came across the book as a teenager, rooting around amidst the books my brother left behind.  I was just coming out then, and decided to try and read it.  Much of it flew over my head then, but upon returning to it as an adult, I found much here to treasure.  The characters not only inhabit the pages, but leap right off them at times, and the reader feels like he would want to sit in a room with them, talk with them, laugh with them and grieve with them.  As a black gay man, it's nearly an autobiographical read, showing how far ahead of his time Baldwin was.  It definitely comes highly recommended from this reader
