This book, along with the Big Book and 12x12, has helped me stay focussed on what's most important in my life . . . God, my sobriety and my family.  With quotes from wise people of all times, it has helped crystalize all the  wonderful things God and AA have given to me.  Most importantly, it helps  remind me how important it is to remain grateful for this new life I've  been given.  It lifts the soul almost every morning I read it.  Buy it!   For you and for those you care about in and outside your program
