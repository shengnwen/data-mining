Some novels are worth reading because of the mystery, or the suspense, and a sexy love story between the main characters is just a sidebar. "Blue Screen" is the opposite. If you already like Parker's non-Spenser heroes Jesse Stone and Sunny Randall, then you cannot help but root for their newborn romance in this book. The mystery is not all that compelling, revolving around who killed a "B" movie star's sister near Boston and a couple of film financial wonks out in L.A. Most of the supporting characters who are killed, or who might be killers, are non-sympathetic. Sunny and Jesse are never in any real personal jeopardy in any chapter. However, they are horny, and hurt, and uncertain about taking up the risks involved with new relationships. So, if you like solving murder mysteries with twists or dangers to the protagonists, this one's not for you. If you, however, are in the mood to travel along for a few weeks with a couple of the good guys, and to observe them tentatively finding new happiness while emerging from destructive divorces, this will be pleasing. Over the past five years or so, the novels featuring Sunny, a private investigator, or Jesse, a  resort town police chief, have been more satisying than the adventures of Parker's main meal ticket, the Boston P.I. Spenser. "Blue Screen" merges, at least temporily, these interesting characters, and to me, that was a smart move on Mr. Parker's part. One cautionary note: Parker seems to be obsessed with the "F" word in this effort, and while it is used more often as a synonym for intercourse than as an angry exclamation, it appears about twice as frequently as it needed to. If you don't like seeing that word in print on every other page, you might want to skip this book.
