By: Jeffrey W. Bennett, author of the Christian novel, Under the Lontar Palm.
Frankly, this novel helps identify strong characters that men can study.  In my continuous search for positive male role models, I have struck gold again in Love Comes Softly.  Clark, a Godly man, receives Marty, a young widow, into his life.  He's strong enough to help her through her mourning, loves her while she is pregant with her late husband's child and continues to be a great father to his own daughter.  

Clark shows us how to be a real man, unlike many of the "heroes" we are forced to endure in other novels of late.
