My family has always loved Robert Munsch's book " I Have to Go". My 4yr old liked to read it so much he brought it into the bath with him. Needless to say we had to replace it and that is when I saw all the other stories that Robert has. I bought several of his books and I have to say that "Smelly Socks" is one of our favorites. I think my son asked me to read it everynight for 1 week straight!!!
