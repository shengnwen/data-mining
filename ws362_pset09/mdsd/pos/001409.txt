Mr. Shaara is a popular historical fiction author with good reason.   His books are thoroughly researched to please even the most demanding history-phile.   At the same time he weaves the story so that the less historically-minded reader will love the story.   Both types of readers will learn without insult to their intelligence.  Gone for Soldiers takes us on a tour of one of the least known or understood wars in American/Mexican history.   The war was, perhaps, a turning point for America and the road she would take in the future toward world empire.   It was a war of lies and backroom deals on the part of politicians and underetimation of opposing armies - a rather familiar story.  It was also a war that set the stage for Mexican-American relations ever since and one that set a precedent for involvement of the US President as an active Commander-in-Chief and the end of the Whig party ideal of a legislative branch with greater power to check executive power.   It changed both countries forever and was the foundary in which the combatants of the later American War Between the States were hardened for the bloodbath to come.   Gen. U. S. Grant often commented that the American War Between the States was a judgement on America for her earlier unprovoked aggression toward her neighbor, one cannot help but make the connection.   Mr. Shaara has done a wonderful job of bringing this important conflict back to our attention for further consideration of where we have been and where we have gone since.   Is it America that has Gone for Soldiers without turning back? 

I would also highly recommend Mr. Joseph Dawson's _Doniphan's Epic March_ (ISBN: 0700609563)
