I enjoyed this book a good deal, particularly Loxterkamp's attention to God and faith and the notion of ministering.  I admire Loxterkamp's bravery for so much soul-searching over a year of his practice.  This is a book to  savor for those interested in rural medicine or family medicine.  I give it  4 stars instead of 5 because I found his writing a bit labored.  It's  slow-going reading.  It's also very much about him, him, him.  A good  contrast is to read Verghese's In My Own Country.  Loxterkamp lacks  Verghese's fluid style and attention to others.  Despite his efforts to  humanize, Loxterkamp presents fairly 2-dimensional portraits of his  patients.  This book is really more of an interior meditation, albeit a  very good one
