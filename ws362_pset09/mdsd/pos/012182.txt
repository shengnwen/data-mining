Great book! A three-in-one tale, really. As Sal, a thirteen-year-old girl from Kentucky, recounts the story of her friend Phoebe's life to her grandparents, we learn about Sal's own journey of coming to terms with reality. At the same time we are offered a peek into the bittersweet life of her whimsical grandparents. To the backdrop of constantly changing scenery during a seven-day trip across the US, we witness Sal's coming of age, guided by her grandparents' constant and unfailing love and devotion to each other and to her. It is a fast paced book, juggling three if not more story lines, but thanks to excellent timing, it breathes patience and gentleness
