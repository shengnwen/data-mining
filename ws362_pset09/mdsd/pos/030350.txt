Working as a bartender, I've bought two copies of the 7th edition for behind the bar and both have disappeared! This book is small and convenient, but loaded with a complete and easy-to-locate list of drinks. There are even a few lists near the back of different frozen drinks, shots/shooters, coffee drinks, etc. to make testing something new out a breeze...or simply open the book to a random page and let the drinking begin! Invaluable behind the bar, I've never had a customer ask me for a drink without it being in this book. It even accounts for the regional differences in some drink recipes (Sex on the Beach for one). HIGHLY recommended.
