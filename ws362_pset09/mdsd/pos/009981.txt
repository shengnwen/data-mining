Auster writes from the position of not having money to live, money to enable him to write, to pursue his art. Those who felt he was writing in the &quot;pursuit&quot; of money misinterpreted his honesty. If one really  struggles just to pay the rent, or to buy food, writing or any other form  of art would take an immediate backseat. Here, it seems, is where Auster is  really suffering. He cannot pursue this calling. The prose, as usual, is  very good, honest. Very underrated
