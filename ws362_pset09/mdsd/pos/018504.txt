Vera B. Williams is a genius at taping the wonderful world of a child and has written an excellent, gentle, and engaging book for first read-alongs. Our whole family adores this pass-along treasure, and my daughter now reads it to our little boy.

Like more and more Americans, we are a mixed race family, but we often have a hard time finding books that reflect our normalcy. Thank God we had this book for our children, which shows a white Grandmother with a black granddaughter, a white man and a white little boy, and an Asian Mommy with her little girl. For the longest time, mercifully, our children thought these were stories about the same family, since this world in miniature reflects their own in real life. Thanks you, Vera Williams.

The illustrations are a little hard to get used to, as they are mixed media and `lost wax' crayon, where surface colors are scratched away to reveal base colors below. My children and I instantly loved them, as they look like our own smeary results when we work on something together. Still, many unfamiliar with the technique would assume the art is unfinished or poor quality, but I assure you your children will love them.

The stories themselves are awkward if you are trying to read them as narrative, but you must carefully listen for the scansion, for Vera Williams has a wonderful ear for rhythm of a few simple words and the common skill of repetition that help children engage with words, and therefore their world.

The form of three is the dominant construct in this work. Three stories, three children, three adults, three relationships, and three repetitions of the actions, and three cries of "more, more, more."

This is an excellent first-words first-stories book, which will nonetheless always prove to be a memorable favorite for your older children. I cannot recommend it enough
