I read this book as one of the requirements for a organization know as the "Caudill Craze". I really liked this book. It was refreshing in the way it was written and the subject. There are not many books in this time that have a moral like this one. I like the way the author used dialect and didn't use proper grammer in the letters that were written, like the way it would have relly been written in 1955. All in all, I personally really liked this book
