This wonderful thriller is the story of Elizabeth Roffe, whose father has just died (or was he murdered?), leaving her heiress to a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical maker.  She takes over the reins of the company, with the help of Rhys Williams, a handsome but mysterious self-made man.  Elizabeth's four quirky cousins and co-owners of the company each have shady pasts and need money, badly.  They are pressuring her to allow the company to go public; she refuses, and becomes the target of an unknown assassin.  
 
This is a book you will not be able to put down.  The story is full of fascinating flashbacks, detailing the often bizarre lives of all the Roffes:  Alec from London, Helene from Paris, Anna from Berlin, and Ivo from Rome.  Each one has a reason to want Elizabeth out of the way, and as the attempts on her life increase, the tension mounts until the killer is revealed in a truly frightening conclusion.   Highly recommended for Sidney Sheldon fans and everyone who enjoys fast-paced stories full of action and memorable characters.  This book was made into an all-star movie with Audrey Hepburn, Omar Sharif, and James Mason.
