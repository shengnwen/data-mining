This is my favorite ODE book.  Ever.  But I guess I'm in the minority on this.  I owned the 5th edition.  My ex owned the 7th edition.  Her book was a bit more flashy -- fancy graphics and whatnot were sort of distracting, but all the things that I love about my copy were true (for me) about her copy.

I really like that they approach the subject via a wonderfully balanced viewpoint -- they do a tightrope walk of being rigorous and making the book useful for us physicists, and our cousins, the engineers.

They go through practical theory but leave out the more exotic elements of ODE theory.

I found the examples to be extremely sufficient.  Sometimes generous.  I can either assume that something awful happened to the 8th edition or that the other reviewers are the type of undergrads who think that a book should have so many examples worked out that if their hw problem isn't worked out for them, the book sucks.

If you really want a zillion examples worked out, I have one word for you: Schaum's.  Read it.  Love it.

This is a textbook.  It presents theory, it gives a few examples, and you're left to practise applying the theory.

I found the text to be very well written.  They're not verbose, but they're not terse either.  Very nice balance.  The explanations and insights are masterfully written.

Where the book really shines is that it's a practical "how to" book.  They cram a lot of different techniques into a nice relatively lightweight book.

The section of PDEs is sufficient and appropriate for the intended level of reader.

I love their problem selection.  In fact, what I love most about their problems is that they often have "teaching problems".  You learn solution techniques through a series of well crafted end of the chapter exercises.

Personally, I think this is the single best undergrad ODE book on the market
