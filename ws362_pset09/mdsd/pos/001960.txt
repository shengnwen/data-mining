This is a jarring and eye-opening collection of voices often unheard in our culture.  It is highly recommended that this book NOT be read until one has looked at his first REAL BOYS offering.  The first work povides the theorectcal context within which these testimonies are most powerful.  This is valuable reading not only for counselors and parents, but for pastors, teachers, and all who work with or care about boys and their lives
