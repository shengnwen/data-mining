I enjoyed this excursion to the Maine Coast with Stone Barrington and friends. He did have me worried a bit that Holly was going to be gone but all in all it worked out okay. I like the Barrington Novels for what they are, a chance for a schlub like me to escape into the upper crust style of living among the Manhattan elite. Dinner at Elaine's every night has got to be an expense that I couldn't afford. Along the way there is a murder or two to be solved which just adds to the fun. Thanks for another enjoyable read
