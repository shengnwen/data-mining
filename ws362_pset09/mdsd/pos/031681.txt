I recommend this book because I followed the advice therein and did in the end get happily published.  You won't be happy at every step of the process.  And you may find that you need more help in some areas than Ms. Applebaum provides.  I had to look elsewhere for additional help with my query letter and my book proposal.  But this book is a great place to start your publishing adventure
