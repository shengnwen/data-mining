Only a charming Italian such as Severgnini could share what makes American culture both obnoxious and endearing at once. His tactful observations make you smile and sometimes laugh out loud in their gentle honesty. 

His year in the Washington DC area begins with the basics that are so routine to most of us ...reading ads for a house, getting a telephone, cable, etc. Through the eyes of a different culture we see these things quite fresh and remember the days where, perhaps through the eyes of a child, we too wondered why we get channel 44 on channel 12?  

This book took me back to my own expatriot days in Europe where everything left me with more questions than answers. I hope all young people read this book to experience a hit of gratitude and compassion for all of the visitors and immigrants that immerse themselves in this Brave New World
