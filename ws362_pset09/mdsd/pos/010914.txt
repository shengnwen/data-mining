I must admit I had never read this until after I saw the movie.  The film left me in awe and as soon as I left the theater I went straight to a book store and bought this book.  If you like comic books and are tired of the same old heroes, then this is the book for you.  The storytelling and characters are top notch, and while Marv is only human, his story is almost superhuman.  This was even better than the film, and inspired me to purchase the other volumes, and everyone is just as good as the first.  Although some may say the violence takes away from the story, I believe it gives you a better understanding of how volatile Sin City is.  Top Ratings!  Order this now
