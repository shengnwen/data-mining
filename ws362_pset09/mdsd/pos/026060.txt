When I first received this book as a gift from my mom, I was amused--it's written by a man!  Well, I gotta tell you, battle of the sexes aside, this is an indispensible little volume, and the author sure knows his stuff!  When you read the book, you'll see that he interviewed cleaning professionals from all sorts of trades--uphostery cleaners, carpet cleaners, house cleaning professionals and even collectors asking them their tricks and secrets for how to clean it properly.  Then he wrote this book, and it's a wonderful little treasure to have around the house--realtors should give it out, it's so handy! 

For instance:  Did you know that there is a difference between "dry clean" and "dry clean only"?  And that dry cleaning down items makes the feathers brittle and can ruin your item?  That the best way to clean your disposal is with a 1/2 cup of baking soda and ice cubes?  That what your mother told you is true--citrus peel really is good for the disposal?

You'll find all of these tips and 1994 others in a very reader friendly alphabatized format with little tips, tricks and warnings in the margins added in the margins.  Honestly, there's literally nothing in your home that you can't find a way to clean better, easier or faster with this book. From Furs to Fountain pens, Down to Telephones, it's in there.  As a full time home maker, I use this book twice as much as I do Mendlesonson's Home Comforts--that's how handy the information is.

It's a great buy and will save you a lot of grief, grime, and Googling!  And along with Bridal Bargains, it makes a great engagement gift. Five stars for value and practicality
