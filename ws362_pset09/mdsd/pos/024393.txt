This was my first time to read anything by Marcia Willett and I found &quot;A Week in Winter&quot; to be a delight. It took me through the life of not only the main character Maudie but many of her family members. Just when I thought I had the plot figured out the author drops a bomb shell. It's focus around Moorgate, a family home, brings all the characters together. It has love and romance, sadness, intrigue, death, the aging process, marriage and much more. Marcia Willeett writes as well as one of my favorite authors,Maeve Binchey
