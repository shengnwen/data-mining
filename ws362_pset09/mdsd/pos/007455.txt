This is one of the best written books I have read in a long time!
The characters are very real. I can identify with two of them. Faith-, strong,caring of family,desirous of providing a home environment for her family, even though she is confident that it is dysfunctional. The depths of her emotions are unforgettable, like when she said "you stopped walking beside me and started to walk in my shadow". The second character I identify with is the inlaw brother, Junior. Junior can see that there are problems in Faith's family, and that his brother possess undesirable habits and is inconsiderate of his wife. I loved the book, I can hardly wait for the next one. I plan to start a collection of her books
