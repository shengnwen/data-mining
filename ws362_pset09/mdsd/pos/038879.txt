This was a wonderful book. The characters are deep and very well developed. Daniel is a little too good to be true, but Gwendolen is the best female character of the time period. She goes through an amazing metamorphosis from spoiled brat to concerned woman. Daniel marrie Mirah because she is his kind and acceptable for him to marry for the time. Jews did not marry English Christians in the 1800's. As a Historian i would know about it. Read this book and watch the PBS companion series from 2002 , it was great
