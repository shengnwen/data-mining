I found this book in a stack of books on sale outside of a Harvard Square book shop, selling for $1.00 in hardcover when I was a poor student.  I think that I bought it mainly because it was a thick fat book and the paper quality was was so good.  A few hours later I opened it to peruse while sitting in Hamburger Cottage and have never looked at food, human appetites, memories, and other hungers the same.  Fisher is now a cult figure but, back then, was barely still in print.  Just try reading only a few pages of her writing.  If you're a poor student, read the chapter about how to keep the wolf from the door, written during the Great Depression in America people had to work hard to keep their spirits up and did it...even in style
