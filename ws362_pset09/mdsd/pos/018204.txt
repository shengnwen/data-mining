Clarke's classic novel should be familiar to everyone by now, so it warrants no real introduction and to review the story in detail would be a rehash of the many glowing reviews submitted here.  I would like to mention the quality of the unabridged audio recording of the 2000 reissue of 2001.

The intruduction is read by Clarke himself.  In it, he describes working with Stanley Kubrick and tells the origins of the story and the relevence it has had on SF culture and our culture in general over the last 40 or so years.  I do find it interesting that Clarke, who explored so many worlds in fiction and fact, was terrified of driving a motor vehicle, just as Kubrick was afraid to fly.

The narration is superb, and the story is brought to life in audio form in a way that deserves the attention of every reader.  Despite having read it on two occasions and having watched the movie several times, I was hooked on this version.  This is one you should check out, no matter how many times you've read the book or seen the movie.

I should, however, add how much more I liked the ending of the book to that of the movie.  It made so much more sense when the place where David Bowman goes in the monolith is described and his mission afterwards is detailed.  This left me wanting to reread the other three books in the series as well as the two short stories from which it was based.
