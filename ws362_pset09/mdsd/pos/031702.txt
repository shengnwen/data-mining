I bought the book initially because the economist issued an article commenting it which draw my interest. Quite honestly, I was surprised to see that it is basically a compilation of works, essays and academic papers defying orthodox finance and economics viewpoints rather than groundbreaking material. Throughout the book, the author cites many heavyweights in different sciences to augment his thesis of a new paradigm in economics along with the typical historical retrospective on economics, from Adam Smith to Samuelson and beyond which serves the purpose of claiming economics is locked in its own on intellectual embargo.

Now, for anyone already exposed to the current thesis in this area, the book might not add as much as it would for someone that is still green on the subject. Notwithstanding this, I would recommend the book to anyone, since the author call has merit, the book is extremly well written and very well structured too while the ideas presented are solid and backed by various authorities in the field.
