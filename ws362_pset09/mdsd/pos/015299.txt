This book changed my life.  I highly recommend it. It is full of practical ideas that anyone, with any income can use to make their money go further.  
I take exception to the reviewers who say the author is "preachy" and "deprives" her children , or saves money as an end in itself.
The author saved money because she had a goal of having a large family that she could rear herslef, not in day care, a goal of purchasing a large, turn of the century home on an acreage, and wanted to do this on a very modest salary.  She repeatedly said these were HER goals, and not for everyone.  She encouraged people to figure out their own goals, even if it meant living in a "shack" and eating out frequently if that is what gives one enjoyment.  She teaches setting your own goals, not her goals, and doing what it takes to reach them.  The negative comments about "poor nutrition" and hygiene are ridiculous.  Meals from scratch, that don't include any junk food, are hardly poor nutrition.
Following the author's advice, and that of the people who contributed to her newsletters, allowed me to quit a job I no longer enjoyed, and live on one income.  Our cars are relatively new, and paid for, our house is paid for, and we continue to live frugally, because money doesn't equal happiness.  I highly recommend this book
