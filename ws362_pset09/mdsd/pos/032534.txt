This is essentially a specifications manual.  It 
is a very important book if you plan on purchasing a 
Bonneville and you want to verify serial numbers, color,
 options, etc.  With this book you will be able to tell
 whether someone painted the bike a different color or if
 they are trying to sell you something other than what they
 say; e.g., a 100% stock original bike
