The previous reviewer claims Spooner's argument against the authority of the Constitution is invalid, since contract law is only possible in the context of a government.  However, the reviewer has it reversed:  though a valid contract may be *enforced* by a government, the government's authority must be *justified* in the first place.  A contract's validity comes not from government, but rather from Lockean natural law.

Statists attempt to justify government sovereignty via social contract theory, which states that taxation and  government authority can be justified according to a supposed "contract" among the citizens, as manifested by the Constitution.  In _No Treason_, Spooner brilliantly and forcefully demolishes this argument by demonstrating this "contract" is not valid in any meaningful sense, according to "principles of law and reason."

As other reviewers have stated, Lysander Spooner's essays will make you never look at the legitimacy of the government, voting, and taxes the same way again, even if you don't agree with his arguments.
