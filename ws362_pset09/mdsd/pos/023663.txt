During planting season, this is the one book I turn to almost daily. It has helped me find plants which will grow and thrive in my shade garden (which has dense, moist soil)...my side yard (which contains areas of chalky, rocky ground)...an area which is moisture-prone and nearly always wet...another area that has some shade, some sun and another with acid soil...and so on. Each page of this book has full-color photos of the plants as well as their final size, flowering season, needs, care, etc. The author goes on to describe those that are perfect for such  ground covers, containers, hedges, etc
