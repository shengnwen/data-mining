Sixteen years after his college graduation, sportswriter Mitch Albom finds himself living exactly the kind of life he swore would never trap him. Money and status have become his gods, and work - work that he doesn't even find satisfying - consumes his waking hours. Then, late one evening, he happens to watch "Nightline." He sees his favorite professor from his college days on the screen, and that's how he learns that Morrie Schwartz is dying of ALS.

Mitch makes time, albeit carved out of yet another business trip, to stop in Massachusetts and visit his old professor. Morrie has already lost the use of his legs, and his teaching career - which he extended far into his 70s - is over at last. Yet the old man's serenity in the face of death, and his joy in the life he's still quite determinedly living, reminds Mitch of exactly why he was once so close to Morrie. Mitch longs to regain what he's lost in the years since then. Morrie, a teacher to the last, wants someone to document his dying process so the lessons he is learning from it can be passed on and benefit others.

That's how this book came to be written. Morrie's "final thesis" is a work of rare wisdom gleaned from the most commonplace of human experiences. As the old professor teaches himself how to die well, he reminds his beloved student - and all of us who read their story - of what it takes to live well first.
