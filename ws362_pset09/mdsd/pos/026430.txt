This is a lovely book full of in-depth information about different types of lavender with beautiful, detailed pictures.  It's a great reference source, but works equally well as a coffee table book because it is so stunning to look at.  I have only one minor criticism of this book and that is that it doesn't go into enough detail about the Lanata hybrids that seem to do well in our hot, dry southern California climate.  I would have liked to have seen more pictures of these particular lavenders (there are a few, but not that many) and would have enjoyed learning more about them
