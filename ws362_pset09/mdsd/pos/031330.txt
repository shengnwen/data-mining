AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is one of METALLICAS BEST ALBUMS...I DONT REALLY LIKE THE LYRICS IN BLACKENED THAT MUCH, I MEAN I LIKE THE SONG BLACKENED. ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRACKS IS EYE OF THE BEHOLDER!! TITLE IS GREAT, BUT TOO LONG!! GET THIS WITH 5 OF THEIR OTHER ALBUMS LIKE BLACK, MASTER OF PUPPETS, RIDE THE LIGHTNING, RELOAD, AND LOAD
