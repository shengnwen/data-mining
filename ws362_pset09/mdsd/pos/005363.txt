   Ms. Shapiro demonstrates exceptional emotional courage by revisiting her past loves in the first place, and then revealing the unraveling of her dilemmas in public. She is a gifted storyteller, artfully narrating the intimate, analytic story of her mid-life crises in a series of engaging, seriocomic vignettes.
   Like most guys, I seldom read this type of book, so I can't make comparisons. But the premise sounds totally original and Susan Shapiro's candidness is remarkable. "Five Men..." is a treat, and seems a natural for a film.
