I purchase this book originally just because I really liked everything else I had read by Voltaire. But it was even better than I though. I really would like to use some of the ideas I got from in my new house. I already used some of the ideas for frame making with some of my miniatures mirrors, so that it gave them an even creepier look. You should buy this book! It great and the humor is wonderful as always
