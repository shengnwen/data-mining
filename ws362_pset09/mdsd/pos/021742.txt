I picked up this book by chance a few years ago. Had never heard of dean koontz, but it was in the same pile as a bunch of stephen King books I was looking at, so I thought ,why not? Started reading and found that I could NOT put it down! Brilliant. I love that quality in a book. haha...
When I had finished, all I could think of was: What happens next? And i had a few questions I didn`t really get answers to in the book. Later that week I found what I thought was the sequel, Fear Nothing. Bought it and startedto read, only to discover that Fear Nothing was book number one and Seize... the sequel. Well at least I got the answers I didn`t get the first time around. I am eagerly awaiting the next book in the series. Buy it. Read it. Love it
