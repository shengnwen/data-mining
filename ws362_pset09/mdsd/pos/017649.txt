"Beyond Oil" by Kenneth Deffeyes is one of a flurry of books about [the consequences of] reaching the maximum production level of conventional crude oil. What makes this book stand out from the crowd?

First, it falls in the right category (at least for me). I have no respect for those authors that take the apocalyptic approach claiming that "the end of the world is nigh". Not Deffeyes. Yes, we have a serious problem but there are plenty of solutions.

Second, Chapter 3 is an instant classic and vintage Deffeyes. I have a copy of King Hubbert's 1956 presentation to the southern district of the API but never managed to explain Hubbert's theory other than by showing people the symmetrical bell-shaped curve. No longer! As Deffeyes puts it "this chapter is an easy opportunity to join the exclusive club of people who actually understand Hubbert".  And I fully agree; in 16 pages and with a few simple formulas and graphs the author runs you through the full Hubbert methodology. 

The remainder is fairly basic. Deffeyes discusses what role the other hydrocarbon resources (natural gas, coal, heavy oil, oil shale, oil sands) can play as substitutes for conventional oil. Nuclear and hydrogen are covered as well. For people interested in those alternatives, I would rather recommend "The End of Oil" by Paul Roberts which has much more depth in this area.

Overall, a pleasant book and certainly one of the better efforts in this domain.
