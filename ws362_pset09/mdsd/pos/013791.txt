I am Jewish and my husband is Italian, so this seemed like the perfect book for us.  It is well organized with appealing photographs and clear, understandable recipes with interesting explanations of the history of each dish, as well as variations and substitions.  We have tried many of the recipes and have never been disappointed.  I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys both cooking and the history of ethnic cultures.
