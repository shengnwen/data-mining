This book is a mid-career biography of Dr. Paul Brand, a leading researcher in rehabilitation for leprosy patients. The book is extremely thorough in its details, perhaps overly so in some places. It begins with the lives of Brand's grandparents, gives a full account of his father's earlier influences, and includes much information about Paul Brand's early childhood in India, as well as his later childhood in Britain. Despite the depth of details, the book is extremely readable, and I found it to be a real page-turner from cover to cover
