This is one of the most "readable" history books I've come across. To say that it is entertaining is NOT a criticism, but a compliment. Why does history have to be dry and pedantic in order to have value? I learned more about life at the turn of the 1st millennium than I have in reading a dozen other more scholarly tomes. This is the way history SHOULD be written. 

Naturally, it is not absolutely complete and all-encompassing (though, given the dearth of contemporary material, most writings are merely speculation anyway). But it is an excellent starting point. If you are intriqued, the books 7-page bibliography should suffice for additional reading.
