I bought the book in search of ways to help my 6 year old overcome apparent reading difficulties.  This book is so well grounded on scientific findings rather than hearsays. Yet it also provides guidelines for tutoring struggling readers and pointers to various resources.  After reading this book, I realized that my child had the typical word-by-word problem described in the book, most likely due to interrupting corrections to his pronunciation.  This book taught me how essential it is to use books of the right level and the right way to tutor a struggling reader.  I put what I learned into practice during a recent vocation and saw great improvement even just after one week.  Now my son no longer feels frustrated when asked to read, rather he starts to enjoy reading.  I really wish that my sons teacher had read this book, but I am glad I found it.  This book really makes me in awe of the power of knowledge gained through serious scientific research.  I recommend it wholeheartedly to parents and teachers alike
