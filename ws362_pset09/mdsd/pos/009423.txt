The writer knew too well how to capture a reader's attention. With humorous dialogues and eccentricity of each character, Mr. Dick had created an enjoyable science/fantasy fiction. The worlds that the persons have to journey and endure are totally bizarre. How each character deals and survives in each world is intriguing. The escape from one world to another is much more exciting. Hamilton, the main character has a dry sense of humor and a temper of a young intelligent scientist. Some of his exploits are uncanny - one big reason in keeping a reader interested and thinking. The ending is terrific. I will certainly check out Mr. Dick's other writings
