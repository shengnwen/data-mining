It is one of the only things that always makes it into my suitcase, even on overnight business trips.  I have shared the inspirational messages with many friends - both male and female, although artistically the cards are distinctly feminine.  This should not, however, dissuade any men from trying them.  My male friends are always excited when they pull one of the "topless" cards.

I've found that they are a great icebreaker when meeting new people.  I have had many new acquaintances open up and share difficult or wonderful personal stories after picking a card that corresponds with something they are struggling with.  They have served as a catalyst for me to learn more about the people in my life and how they are feeling.

I often joke that this deck is the closest thing I have to religion in my life.  There is probably some truth to that.  I know this review probably sounds really over the top, but everybody has their own sacred relic that helps them get through the day - a St. Christopher, a gold cross, a tattoo, a Bible or whatever.  These cards are mine.  Thank you for creating them
