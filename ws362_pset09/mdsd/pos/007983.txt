I actually decided to read Borg's books after reading some of John Crossan's books where Borg was referenced. I thought the set-up of this book was extremely helpful in illustrating what Borg was discussing. However, I think I had hoped this would be more of a "heart-felt" novel. I understand Borg had to get in all the historical information about Jesus (and he did an incredible job at that) but I had hoped he would speak of Jesus on more of an emotional level. I felt as I was more of an outsider looking in on the life of Jesus rather than a comrade right next to him. And perhaps that is the effect Borg wanted. All in all, a great book with great information. What I found most interesting in this whole book was the link between Jesus and Sophia (wisdom). Borg makes an excellent point to contrast the "Son of God" image of Jesus by saying Jesus was personified as Wisdom- a feminine term in Greek. He does this to stress the many metaphors used when defining Jesus and says we must not take them literally. All in all a great read with great information.
