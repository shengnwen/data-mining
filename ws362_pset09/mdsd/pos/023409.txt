My name is Denise Saulsberry and I am a student at Macon State College.  I was required to read a book for my education class about teaching.  I feel I made an excellent choice. Black Teachers on Teaching was very enlightening about the things black teachers experienced in the past and things they still encounter in the work place. It also gave some insight on different situations you will experience and ways of dealing with them. This book was an interesting and excellent read
