The "Prince of Fire" continues the story of a reluctant Israeli intelligence operative.  Silva's books that feature Gabriel as the main character are far superior to the ones without him.  While his plotlines follow similar patterns, the historical research and field work that clearly goes into these books is what sets them apart from most of the drivel you find on the bestsellers list. In this book, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict sets the stage for the usual array of assassinations, political plotting, and covert missions. While the story is geared toward action and suspense, Silva keeps the plots grounded enough where they are still within the realm of possibility.

Silva knows Europe and Israel well, his writings that cover these areas are always a cut above his writings about America where he seems stiff and constrained, but when he is describing the backstreets of Rome or Tel Aviv, he is in his element. The author has improved from his earlier works were the evil characters lacked the depth of character of the "good" guys.  In "Prince of Fire" they take on rich deep description that adds to the quality of the work. I admit, I am hooked and I look forward to working my way through all of his "Gabriel" books"
