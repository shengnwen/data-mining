This is a very cleverly written short story.  This author takes everyday people, plants them in a normal situation that readers can relate to, and solves a mini-mystery in a logical, yet humorous way.  And she always has unexpected twists and surprise endings.  Fantastic!

As a huge fan of both the singer of the famous song, Me and Bobby McGee, Janis Joplin, and the song-writer, Kris Kristofferson, I knew I had to read this story the minute I saw the title.

Was Bobby McGee a real person or just a figment of imagination?  If real ... ? Well, I don't want to give the story away, so I can't say another word. I'll let this author's senior citizen characters surprise you with their "take" on the popular song from the sixties.

An intriguing, humorous short story that's very concise and descriptive.  I could smell the fumes from that old tour bus and the more refreshing smell of the ocean as I took my seat in my favorite lounge chair and went along on Dravis's imaginary adventure.  

Having read all her books and now starting on her short stories, I can vouch that Dravis is a really good writer. If you haven't read her novels, try a short story first ... I bet you'll be as sold on her as I am.
