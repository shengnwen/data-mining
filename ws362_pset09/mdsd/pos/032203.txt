A very interesting novel about the stolen European treasures by the Nazis (which the Nazis tried to hide and relocate once hey knew that they were about to be defeated by the Allies).  A former curator, Ben Revere, finds a priceless painting from a thought-lost Nazis loot. Soon someone is killing those who know about the painting and anything associated with it. One of Elkins' best books, extremely entertaining.
