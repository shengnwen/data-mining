I have been working with young children and their families for over 20 years and am pleased that there is finally a book that clearly illustrates the link between childrens misbehavior and the lack of sleep. Our kids are crying out for more rest but often our busy lives keep us from noticing these behaviors. I have read every other book this author has written and would read more if she had another.  She gives us time tested strategies and tools, easy and simply explained ideas to implement a positive sleep environment all day long. She shares humorous and real life stories from the hundreds of parents she has worked with. Filling in the sleep chart has been extremely insightful. I also found the red zone/green zone information helpful in quickly assessing all family members levels of tension. I am so glad someone finally has written a friendly, helpful, humorous book on sleep that doesn't encourage kids crying it out or abandoning our young children at night. Instead, she gives us tools to use all day long to make nap time and bedtime rewarding and peaceful for everyone. Parents will read this book and know they are doing a great job
