Let me start by saying that the only Stephen King books I have read are the first four Dark Tower books, so am not biased for or against his work. I just took this book for what it was, a great story. It brings the first three books together. This book was so good, in fact, that I now want to read more about Cuthbert, Alain, and Roland's young Gunslingers' adventures than the actual "everyone's dead" tower quest.
Anyone who says this book was too long or that it was an unnecessary addition to the series doesn't appreciate exceptional character development and a slow suspenseful buildup to an epic confrontation between good and evil.
