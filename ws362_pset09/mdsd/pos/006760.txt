I decided to pick this book up after watching one of my favorite movies "The Shining" by Stanley Kubrick based on this book. There are a lot of things that I found strange and unexplained in the movie and I thought 'Maybe if I read the book they will be explained.' I definitely felt that the book was able to go into much more detail, very scary, I didn't want to read it alone. There are a lot of things the book is able to describe that would not have been believable or frightening if they tried to put it into the film. There is also a lot of character description, it really builds on Jack's past with alcholism which really helps you understand his character more. It was a great book
