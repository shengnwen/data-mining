Quinn is a young lawyer, born in Britain but now married to an ambitious American attorney and living in New York City.  They are expecting a child, but their lives are turned upside down when Quinn is told that she must stay on bed rest for the remainder of her pregnancy to delay a possible pre-term delivery as long as possible.  During her bed rest, Quinn occupies herself by making to-do lists, seeing family and friends, and getting ready for the birth of her child.

Quote: "Crack open Sylvia Plath's "Ariel" when life seems hard to bear.  It's always good to discover that someone else has been closer to the screaming edge than you are."

This is one of those books that is written as if it is the diary of the main character- although I did not find it to be as big on flow-of-consciousness as some works with a similar premise, such as "Bridget Jones' Diary."  The problem with this work is that, although it is entertaining, I found Quinn and those around her much less endearing than would be necessary to make this book really work.  There was a nearly complete lack of sympathetic or appealing characters portrayed (which may be because it was written from Quinn's perspective and the bed rest has made her touchy), but everyone in her life is completely annoying, which made it really difficult to care whether all the individual story lines worked out okay
