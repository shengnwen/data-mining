Bogle, Bob Brinker, and Jane Bryant Quinn sold me on the idea of index funds. There are some who believe you need to stick to actively managed funds to, as one money manager told me, "be there to steer the plane away from the mountain at the last minute." Hogwash, especially when you consider a lot of blend funds have 95 percent the same allocations as comparable index funds, only you pay the higher expense ratios.

I've done very well with index funds covering the S&P 500, as well as the European and Pacific markets. I'm just now breaking into the index fund's conceptual spawn, the ETF.

One complaint: the book is indeed repetitive. The major selling points (e.g., expense ratios, tax efficiency, market allocations, etc.) could have been stated as well with half the text. It's also a somewhat tedious read, but still worthwhile. (I'm a CFP in training.
