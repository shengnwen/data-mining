I usually stay away from bios of politicians, especially reads on living politicians who frequently write to exonerate/excuse/justify/blame etc... This book is a great read sice McCain's political life is purposely avoided. Sen McCain, obviously and justifiably proud of his heritage, spends a good deal of time delving into his family tree. Coupled with naval and military history, this potion of the book is interesting, though I felt a little too detailed. His war time experiences are horrific and inspiring. The bravado I expected to accompany his experiences was not there. He is a man who had a job to do and he did it. He suffered greatly, and he explained his weaknesses. He is straighforward and shows a personal and vulnerable side not shown in his political discussions. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to appreciate true hardships the power of the human spirit to shine
