Social interaction and growth is a continuum of observation, inquiry, and application. In Conscious Evolution, Barbara Marx Hubbard describes this process in stunning detail and guides us on how to incorporate spirituality into social policy.  Hubbard's inspirational analogy of humankind as a catepillar morphing into a butterfly stimulates the reader's mind to envision how the collective fate of humanity need not end in an apocalyptic, &quot;judgment day&quot;-like scenario.  Hubbard weaves a coherent plan of action to help humanity become more globally minded, cultarally integrated, and aware of its own strengths and weakneses through thoughtful insight and inclusion of the ideas and actions of other intellectuals, activists and spiritualists.  The reader learns how to unite his or her own community into a stronger, socially conscious, spiritual unit, which in turn leads to an increased ability for humanity to direct and speed evolution. Consciously! I recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn how to participate in the outcome of humanity! Buy 5 copies and pass it out to friends!!!
