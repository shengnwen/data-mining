I read this book because Holly Van Gulden recommended it at an attachment workshop I attended. I've read it twice now and I refer to it all the time.

Fraiberg's writing style is a bit awkward at times, so it took me a while to get through the book, but it was definitely worth the effort. She offers reasonable and understandle explanations of the stages and struggles of the developing young child. Using concrete examples from her vast experience, she addresses the roles of anxiety, fear, imaginary friends, and language in the emotional and intellectual development of the child from birth through age six. 

As the mother to a child with mild attachment problems, this book was invaluable in helping me gauge my daughter's emotional development and making informed decisions about the kind of therapeutic parenting she needs. I found Fraiberg's explanations and advice to be reassuring and empowering
