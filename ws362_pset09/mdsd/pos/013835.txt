This book provides a good overview of venture capital and buyout fund management.  It addresses the investment process through four modules: fundraising, investing, exiting, and new frontiers.  There are twenty nine chapters of which nine are instructional and the rest are case studies.  Though there is information interspersed within the case studies, I think it would have been better to have had shorter case studies and longer instructional pieces to delve more deeply into subjects.
