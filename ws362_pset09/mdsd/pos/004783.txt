This is a FANTASTIC book about passion behind business, dealing with major growth, serving the customer, helping people from the heart, actually caring about the consumer, and caring about humanity at the same time. 

STARBUCKS and this book is a phenomenal role model for anyone in business, and for anyone who cares about more than just dollars. 

One of my favorite quotes as an example is: "Starbucks managers have the power to allocate donations to local causes like ballet and opera companies, AIDS organizations, food banks, schools, and PTAs. In every city, all eight-day old coffee beans are donated to food banks. Store managers also provide coffee for fund raisers...Since we don't exploit these actions for public relations, a lot of our customers don't even know about them." 

Here's to one incredible book, company, and the example that would help so many people if followed. They clearly are THE BEST for business, and for PEOPLE, and that's why their genuine from-the-heart care has paid off so well. 

This book is EXCEPTIONAL if you are looking for SUPERIOR a business model for success where everybody genuinely benefits. 

Deserves 10 Stars!
