Jayne Ann Krentz has done it again with this delightful, charming book. As always, the characters in this book are stunning! They are very dynamic and true-to-life and they are people you'd want to know. Cleo is a down-to-Earth woman with an underlying sensuality that she is desperate to bring forth. Max is successful in everything he tries, everything that is, except relationships. He is searching for a place he fits in. He finds that place in a remote inn known as the Robbins' Nest Inn. Robbins' Nest is peopled with a group of characters who call themselves 'the family' and are funny, warm and complex. These delightful denizens are headed up by the Inn owner, Cleo Robbins. 

Here, among these people, Max finds the love and acceptance he has been searching for all his life. Cleo and 'the family' take him in and add him to the bunch almost instantly. With their help he learns that being part of a family isn't about when you mess up, it's about being there. Watching Max break out of his shell and flourish under Cleo's love and the love of 'the family' is heartwarming. 

There is a mystery that plays throughout the book and unlike usual, I had half of it figured out almost instantly. The other part of the mystery, nevertheless, kept me guessing until the end. 

However, the mystery is not the driving force of this book as is most times the case. The tone of this story is definitely self-discovery. Watching Cleo and Max discover each other and learn things about themselves is wonderful. 

I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The humor, the passion, and the love were touching and kept me interested right from the first. One of the best by Ms. Krentz in any of her many incarnations. I am always pleasantly surprised by the high quality and wonderful characters in Ms. Krentz's books. Buy this book now -- you won't be disappointed
