Hawking's book is a real treat to read. It's a lavish exploration of matter, the universe, and our place in it. From quantum mechanics to black hole thermodynamics, Hawking is an expert in revealing the vast expanse of the universe, from the micro to the macro, in language spiced with humour and simplicity. Typical of Hawking's style is his attempt to make the book interesting to a wide audience, from high school students to every kind of adult layman, and he suceeds impressively in doing so.
The most important and wonderful aspect of the book is the unprecedented use of illustrations that are colourful, lavish, and highly explanatory. Kudos to both Hawkins and his artist for them.
Hawking may lack the poetic eloquence of say Brian Greene in talking about the ultimate mysteries of the cosmos, but his style on the other hand reflects the supreme elegance of someone who has seen it all, as one of the premier cosmologists of the century. For sheer simplicity, awe, and humour, this popular treatment of the universe and its quirks is hard to beat
