This book is the best book on ashtanga yoga on the market - a must have for any person interested in ashtanga yoga. It covers all aspects, showing easier versions of the poses so that the beginner can also follow it.
The back of the book has shorter versions of the full primary series so that when you are limited for time, you can do a shorter workout.
The only thing about this book that is not so great is that when you have used it for a long time, the edges of the pages start to tear due to the way it has been bound. It has been bound this way so that the pages stay open while you are practising a pose
