Interesting autobiography-biography of a German soldier on the Eastern front. Written from the unique perspective of a Mormon in the German army. An East Prussian Mormon at that, raised in the Memel area of Prussia-Lithuania. Readers who have read Guy Sajer's "The Forgotten Soldier" may remember the intensity and horror of the fighting around Memel towards the end of the war. 
The author's situation was fascinating, since Mormonism advocates obedience to governmental authorities. Hence, Naujok being under Nazi German authority, was in a difficult situation of serving a morally questionable regime. 
My only complaint was with the poor quality of the book itself. This was the fault of Mill Creek Press in Salt Lake City, Utah. The quality of the binding was poor, with pages coming out on a regular basis. Since my copy was brand new, this was wholly unacceptable. 
Overall -- good read, but avoid books by this publisher.
