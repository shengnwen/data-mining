The author of the junior novel which the film Babe was based on has written a great tale about a dog named Henry.  The Invisible Dog is a quick and simple read that both children and adults will enjoy.  There are also a few illustrations inside as well.

Henry is a Great Dane and only a little girl named Janie and an old lady at the end of the street can see him.  To everyone else Henry is invisible at a disturbing at times imagination of Janie who just seems to be carrying the family's dead dog's collar around the place.  Janie knows Henry is real, she feeds it invisible food and cleans up its invisible waste and her father has told if she can raise $500 they'll get a dog everyone can see.  Janie is very specific though, she knows the colour and everything that the dog they will get will be, because she's been walking it everyday for a long time now.
