Fernandez-Armesto's venture into environmental history further enhances his reputation as the leading scholar producing large-scale history.  Here he classifies civilizations according to the general type of environment in which they arose, flourished and---often---declined.  Environments and their civilizations include highlands (Zimbabwe, Inca, Aztec); small islands (Polynesia, Malta, Crete); deserts (Peru, Sahara, Gobi), among others.  He then analyzes their adaptations to these settings, as well as exploring other factors.  This is an ambitious if not wholly successful work, and an exceptionally thoughtful one.  Among other merits, his discussion of the thorny issue of defining a "civilization" is both sensible and relaxed, unlike some other, rather overwrought treatments (Spengler, Toynbee, Huntington).  Like all his work, "Civilizations" is studded with insightful comments and distinguished by sparkling literary style.  That said, there are a few flaws.  Some equally valid alternate typologies exist to categorize societies and cultures, and some of these civilizations were not fully distinct from others.  Despite his best efforts, this work does not fully escape the shadow of determinism.  This US edition is not well-supplied with the illustrations (the British edition has photos) maps, diagrams and statistical tables that are very helpful in dealing with environmental data.  Lastly, the author relies almost entirely on published primary and secondary sources, but this is really a necessity in creating history on such a huge canvas.  It's the only way to avoid the "Lord Acton Trap:" that famous Victorian historian sought to write the entire history of human liberty strictly from manuscript sources, and as a result he never completed a single book.  Write on, Dr. Felipe
