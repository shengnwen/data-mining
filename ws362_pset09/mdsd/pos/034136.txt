This book was an easy read. Out of all the books I've read this one contained a literary character, Leon, which made the book enjoyable to me.  I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because I thought the ending was a bit abrupt. This book really made you feel for the characters. Leila was torn between family responsibility and wanting her own life.  I feel that this book was really about identity. As I said before, Leon is one of the best literary characters I read about he's both simple and complex. The kind of guy that can't seem to catch a break and constantly keeping busy. Other than that it's worth picking up the book because I couldn't put it down
