We didn't know much about Norse myths when we bought this book but we sure do now! We've been reading this book, one story every night, together and it is not only well written but the illustrations are very cool too. I had D'Aulaires' book of greek myths when I was a young girl and LOVED it, continued looking at the illustrations long after I read the stories, so I took a chance on buying this one. We're all glad we did
