I think that Many Moons is one of my favorite books. I like it because it has details that you can imagen easily. For exaample it says in the story that the royal wizard was a little,thin man with a long face. He wore a high red peaked hat covered with silver stars,and a long blue robe covered with golden owls.My favorite part of the story was the ending.I like this part because it leaves you wondering,doesthe court Jester have magical powers? You also wonder,how could a Joker know what to do? If Many Moons was in a best book competition, Many Moons would win!  That is why I like Many Moons. THE END
