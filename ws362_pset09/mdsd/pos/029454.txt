This excellent book does a lot to explode myths about female violence.  It is particularly timely in its discussion of female juvenile violence, and has an excellent update relating to school shootings, etc.  Her finding  seem to match those of the more insightful researchers in the field  (see the website "violentkids," for a summary of research).  A very  helpful, and very well-written, book
