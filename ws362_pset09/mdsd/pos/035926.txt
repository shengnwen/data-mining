Well written.  Mr. Nimoy remains humble and grateful for the success of the show.  I am impressed; the book was an easy and yet extremely interesting read.  Coming from the perspective of someone who grew up with the show - I enjoyed the details I never knew.  Also, growing up without much financial resources (money) Star Trek -for some reason- gave me hope.  May you (Mr. Nimoy) and the rest of the crew - live a long and prosperous live.  Thank you for the years.  May God bless Scotty
