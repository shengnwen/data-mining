This is the second book of letters from Elizabeth Darcy to her sister Jane and other family members and friends. The first covers only one year while this book covers the five following years of her marriage to Darcy and life at Pemberley. Without giving away any plot elements, this book contains real and sometimes heartbreaking events that Jane Austen would probably not have written about but which made me love Elizabeth even more for her courage and strength. I think you'll find this book like hearing from an old friend again
