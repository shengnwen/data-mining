I finished this moving book a week ago, and still think about it often.  Beyond the horrors of war, so graphicly and vividly depicted so as to cure even the most hard-headed youth of war glory fantasies, I found myself haunted by the shell of the man the author had become after his experiences.  Haunted by the trauma of his experience, he has also found himself a stranger everywhere, loathed by most, and misunderstood by all, including his family.  He is a broken fragment.  He writes about relationships during the war, both romantic and friendly, with a cold finality, reflecting reality, which sticks in your gut, reminding you that life is not a movie.  

I don't really have a true criticism of this book.  It is a wartime memoir of a German soldier on the Eastern front, and succeeds marvelously in this.  However, I would have liked to see a bit of reflection on what motivated Guy Sajer as a soldier.  Why was he in the Nazi army?  Did he ever question Hitler?  Did he realize that he was fighting to support a regime committing genocide?  I also wonder if he did not selectively censor out atrocities committed by the Nazis.  Buying eggs from Russian peasants, flirting with local Polish farmgirls, why the Nazis come off as downright loveable at times in this account.  I was also flabbergasted and intrigued at how he could have felt the Germans were somehow liberating France when they invaded and conquered it, and would have loved to read more of his thinking as to how he rationalized this in his 16-year old mind. 

Overall, I highly recommend this book.  It is a tremendous addition to any WW II collection, and essential to understanding the other side of the conflict.  You'll have to look elsewhere though, for insights into the politics of the German army.
