Wow!  I loved this book!  Between Jane being in a bread box, to Rufus getting on the freight train car.  I think that everybody will like this book if they read it.  When I started this book, it was like I couldn't put it down.  I would read it like 2 hours a day, and I only was required to read 30 minutes for school!  I loved it!  Now I'm starting to read all the sequels to Eleanor Estes' fantastic books.  I'm telling you, READ THIS BOOK
