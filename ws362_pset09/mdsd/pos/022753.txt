OK. So you have your average vampires but along comes Veronique. Veronique is not just your ordinary vampire. Veronique is Immortal. Immortal in the sense of when Mr. Pointy strikes home on Veronique and shes up the next night. Just not in the same body. Veronique worships these demons and in return she earns a certain Immortality. The ability to reincarnate when she is killed. Her mission: To bring her masters to our world and drink the blood of the last man on Earth. Buffy isn't exactly thrilled. I liked this book because it was something different. Usually there are these vamps that are just tough but Veronique can't be defeated.
