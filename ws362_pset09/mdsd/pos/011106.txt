Since I did not read Three Junes previously, I had no sense of let down that other readers seemed to have. I feel privileged to realize that when I pick up Three Junes I will probably think it is even better if half the criticism here is true. But as a first time Glass reader, I was really impressed. I love her writing style and I did not have a problem with storyline breaks and sections that went back and forth from past to present. If anything it made it more interesting. I do agree that I was actually not sympathetic to the two main characters, Greenie and Alan. I found the secondary characters much more appealing and enjoyable. 

When I picked up the book, I did not realize that it dealt with 9/11, which I scrupulously avoid as a general rule. I was shocked to find myself reading about it, however, I do think she did a fantastic job portraying the event and the aftermath of New Yorkers as well as the rest of the country. Of the three storylines in the book, I was disappointed in the way Saga's storyline was wrapped up. It felt like the conclusion was an afterthought and I was dissatisfied by how she ended it. For that reason alone, I couldn't give it 5 stars. However, I am glad to have found a new author to add to my list of must reads. This was a very good book
