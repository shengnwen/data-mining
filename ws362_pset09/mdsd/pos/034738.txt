As a mother of a six year old boy who has been attending Dawn Barnes Karate for over two years and as a teacher of child education I was asked to read this new chapter book.Night on the Mountain of Fear was a very entertaining story.  I tried to read it from a childs point of view not as an adult.  
The story is written in a way that I could imagine myself there in the journey with the Black Belt Club.  The imaginative descriptions and the wonderful pictures on every page helped make it seem more real.  
I felt that this story hit on two of the most valuable concepts for children to know and understand in the world today.  One was to feel good enough about yourself and to believe that if you try your best and never give up you will succeed in life.  The other concept was that love and friendship is more powerful than hate. The story is a good way to have a little adventure and to remind us of things that are important. The Black Belt Club has to keep their balance of mind, body and spirit.
I am presently reading the story to my son and he is really enjoying it.In the middle of the chapters he likes to practice the kata moves that are in the back of the book.  He now wants to be in the Black Belt Club and go on a journey
