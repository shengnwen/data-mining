In the Berkshires, the Second Chances wedding planners (Jo, Lily, Elaine and Sarah with help from Andrew) are ecstatic with the success of a societal wedding bash and a terrific New Year's Eve party.  Customers want their service so everything looks excellent.  This includes a relationship between Andrew and Jo.

Happiness unravels when Sarah, who has never married though now forty-three and runs a wedding planning business, sadly watches her lover takes his son and moves to New York.  On top of that the groom John from their poster board wedding flees his marriage and his business.  His wife Irene turns to John's prot�g� Andrew to keep the business afloat so he travels to New York to help.  Not long afterward Jo arrives in the Big Apple to surprise her lover but she receives the bigger surprise when Irene insists she tasted Andrew first at the same time that Sarah's biological mother who deserted her years ago want to meet her now.

The third Second Chances tale continues to look deep into the lives of the four middle age women and through them to other people that are close to each one of them.  The story line rotates between the females as each has a major event impact their lives (and probably future stories).  Fans of character driven contemporary fiction will want to read Jean Stone's fine by the numbers novel.
