This book is a great tool to learn how to be excellent with your money. I love how people (or a certain reviewer) think that budgeting is over-rated/evil. I doubt that you could find a successful business or a millionaire who doesn't budget everything. Many people have plenty of money and plenty of skill and wheel power to not spend more then you make, and still know how to come out ahead. But there is a reason that bankruptcies and debt problems have sky rocketed in the past ten years. Some people just don't know how to spend and save, or some people are like me; I had some bad things happen in life that caused me to be in a lot of debt not by my choosing. Because of this I could not afford an expensive financial planer to help me.

The budget product that "Rich on Any Income" talks about is $12 that is $1 a month; it is a little book, like a check balancing book. Yes this can be duplicated in any number of ways, from Excel to a .25 cent note pad. But the key is this book gives you the know how to get out of debt and stay out of debt!

This is a great book for young people learning about money as well
