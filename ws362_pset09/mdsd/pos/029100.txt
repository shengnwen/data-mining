Once again David Morrell does not disapoint. Desperate Measures is a great read by the man who brought us First Blood , Brotherhood Of The Rose, and other great novels. This is another great book that has great character development. Mat Pitman starts out wanting to end his own life but when he is given a assignment he begins to fight for his life. Part of Morrell's magic is that he can make you see what the characters are going through and always make each event in the book be significant when it comes to the end. He also shares yet another political view of McCarthyism and the Red Scare in the 1950's which is what this book's plot is all about. Mr. Morrell does it again
