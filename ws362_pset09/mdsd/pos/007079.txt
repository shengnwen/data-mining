Have you ever been teased or been called names just because of the way you look?, I'm sure a lot of people have especially during Jr high. Everybody is different in their own way.
In The Misfits by James Howe it teaches you a lesson about being different. "Misfit" means to not fit in. This book is about four friends: overweight Bobby, outspoken Addie, outrageous Joe and sloppy Skeezie. They are four best friends who are completely different from each other. The story is mostly based in 12 years old Bobby Goodspeed who has been through many hard times in his life. He lost his mother and had to start to work at a young age to help his widowed father. The group of friends formed a new political party in their seventh grade elections. They face more than one obstacle from their teachers and other students. It's about putting an end to things.
I really enjoyed reading this book because it's really funny and it teaches you a great lesson, judge people by who they are not what they look like The author is known for other great books like Bunnicula Howliday inn, Night-Nightmare, and many other books. He also has more than seventy books for young readers. He is also the editor of the Color Of Absence:12 stories about loss and hope.
I loved this book very much because it has so many parts of the book you can relate to. It makes you laugh and cry. It seems so real because you could relate to it. I recommend this book to everyone. GO GET IT!!!!!
