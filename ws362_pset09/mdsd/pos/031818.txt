A therapist suggested this book to me. I read it, RE-read it and suggested to the therapist he should really read this- one of the GREAT books of our time!!! James Hollis lays it on the line...Yes, it's heavy reading, certainly not a "lightweight-feel good" type of book but is it EVER worth the effort!!! It literally brought me to a place where I was able to turn my life around (I'm 51) and eliminate problem areas for that had held me back for 30 or 40 years!!!

IF you're truly searching for how to make sense of this existence we have AND you've tried many other avenues (without much success) then you owe it to yourself to read this- You won't be disappointed!!
