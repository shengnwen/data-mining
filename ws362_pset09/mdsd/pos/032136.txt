"The Murders in the Rue Morgue" is the short story I read, but it was not from this edition.  I have the Barnes & Noble Penguin 60s Classics edition, which contains only this story.  While short, this story clearly has a climax, resolution, and all other fundamentals that would be expected within a novel.  The two main characters are clearly fashioned like Sherlock Holmes and his deductive investigating methods (Dupin) and his at times duped companion Watson (the unnamed narrator at times).  While I found the first 6 pages humdrum, since it only explained the analytical method of thinking (Dupin's way of thinking), and then Dupin's tedious soliloquies about how the murder may have been committed rather drably, the actual explanation of the crime is what caught my attention.  I did expect more morbid images, since this is, in fact, Poe.  An entertaining short story.  I recommend
