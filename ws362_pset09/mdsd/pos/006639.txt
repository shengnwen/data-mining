I enjoyed reading this book, I found the text quite interesting and the pictures where vivid and well framed.  The authors did a commendable job of choosing the houses for the book, many of the mansions are famous, many where not, but all had an interesting story.  I was surprised to see how many homes where covered, considering that it is not a large book, you really do get a nice bang for you buck so to speak.  If you are someone who just wants a quick synopsis on lots of great American houses then I don't think you will be disappointed in this book, just realize that many homes are covered and as such, not a lot of time can be spent on each home.
