Hell, best novel ever written. A thrilling story, but the writing is what's truly phenomenal. The story seems more painted than written. I don't know how Grey did it, but you see everything, vividly: the colors, shapes, skies, rocks, plants, animals, people. You don't just read about them, you see them through the words. Not just an exciting western story, but a captivating experience. A work of genius.
