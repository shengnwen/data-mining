This is the second time I have read this book and I teach a university class on the Vietnam War and highly recommend it to my students.  It was one of the earlier books on life as a POW and it verified what I had heard from a friend who also had been a POW in South Vietnam.  Life was much harder for the POWs in South Vietnam than for those held in North Vietnam.  The ones in the South were not tortured like those in the North, but the living conditions were better in the North.  I especially found it interesting at hearing Nick Rowe's dismay and how much it affected his morale to hear all the anti-war propoganda provided by the VC but most of it was just reports of the ongoing anti-war protests in the U.S.-many by senators and congressmen as well as celebraties-a direct parallel to the ongoing war in Iraq.  The irony was that Nick Rowe, after being a prisoner for five years in Vietnam, escaped in 1968 and was later killed in 1989 in the Phillipines by communist insurgents
