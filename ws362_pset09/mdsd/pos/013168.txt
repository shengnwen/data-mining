I have absolutely loved reading this book!  I have had my fears relieved and been encouraged in every way.  When the idea of homeschooling entered my life, I thought it would be an impossible task.  Diana explains  homeschooling with such excitement and devotion. I have come to the  realization that homeschooling is not a technique, but a lifestyle!  A  lifestyle my family has needed and is already benefitting from.  Diana  gives reference to many wonderful books and points out her favorites. I  highly recommend this book
