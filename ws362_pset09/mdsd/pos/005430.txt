Michael and his family have just moved to a new home, and Michael is not happy about it at all.  The man who lived here before them was very old and he died in this house.  It is not well maintained, and includes a falling-down garage.  Michael is far away from his school and his friends who go there.  The other problem in Michael's life is his baby sister.  She was born too early and is very sick.  His mother and father worry that the baby might die, and she is in and out of the hospital as the doctors desperately try to make her strong enough to survive.

One day Michael sneaks away and enters the dangerous garage--a place his parents instructed him not to go.  But Michael is not alone in the garage.  There is someone, or something, there.  His raspy voice seems human, but how could a human have lived in the garage for so long without moving?  Michael and his new friend next door, Mina, make friends with this strange creature.  When they bring it out one night to move it to a safer place, they realize something truly amazing about it.

I loved the slightly supernatural element in this book.  Everything is very realistic except for the creature in the garage.  I really liked the character of Mina; she is a good balance for Michael.

The tone of this book is a bit dark, especially at the beginning, but it worked for the story
