The Falcon at the Portal picks up some years after the painful events of The Ape Who Guards the Balance (painful for me because I didn't like the book, and painful for the Emersons personally).  David and Lia are finally to be married, Nefret and Ramses haven't sorted themselves out yet, and Amelia and Emerson are still themselves.  All sounds well enough, but when David is accused of forging artifacts, and Emerson submits to blackmail to keep the accusations secret, the Emerson family detection machine goes into action to keep the newlyweds happy and safe.  The mystery follows the family on their seasonal expedition to Egypt, where Amelia has a chance to excavate a (shabby) pyramid.  Then the usual annoyances-- sprays of gunfire, near-fatal 'accidents,' despicable family members-- pop up, and before too long the Emersons find a very dead body at the bottom of a pyramid shaft.  

I will be brief: I loved this book.  The snappy dialogue and vibrant characterization I want from a Peabody book was there.  The interaction between the 'kids': Ramses, Nefret, David, and Lia-- was delightful.  Lia, an annoyance in the previous book, was redeemed here, and the chemistry between David and Ramses sparkles as usual.  Cyrus and Katherine Vandergelt, my favourite recurring characters, also have some wonderful scenes.  I don't necessary read Peabody books for the mystery, I read them because I enjoy being immersed in the atmosphere that the characters generate.  This installment of the series was as richly atmospheric as any: the scenes between David, Lia, and Ramses on board the Amelia, or the &#34;war-room&#34; scene where the Emersons finally break the forgery story to David's family and to the Vandergelts-- great stuff.  I'd love to see it onscreen.  I enjoy the &#34;mental&#34; aspect of this book, as I watch considerable minds of these characters puzzle out the messy situation they're in. 

I don't want to say more about the plotline.  The storyarc is a devastating one, though I don't find the &#34;soap-opera&#34; label warranted.  This particular novel is likely to upset fans of the series (judging from other reviews, it sure seems to).  I loved it, and I feel it makes a perfect companion piece to its sequel, the magnificent He Shall Thunder in the Sky.  This book ends with the fabric of the Emerson family unraveled, and &#34;Thunder&#34; takes those threads, mingles them with other threads from throughout the series, and weaves them into something grand.

(I will add that I read &#34;Thunder&#34; first, and so got the catharsis and closure *before* I read the traumatic stuff.  I read them in proper order later and still liked them.)  

It's still a fantastic series; it's just not the lighthearted romp it once was.  The changing tone of the series fits the changing backdrop of &#34;current events&#34;-- genteel Victorian travellers &#62; tourist infestation &#62; the Sudanese war &#62; tourist infestation  &#62; native unrest and the premonitory twitches of World War I.  

I would give this four-and-a-half stars if possible.
