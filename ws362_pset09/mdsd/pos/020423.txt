If you, like me, have seen the film with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks and are playing with the idea of reading the book, you are reading the right review!  If you were in front of me, I would look at you with a grin (as if to show that I knew something you didn't) and encourage you to do so.  

Frank Abagnale is less likable in the book, which is to be expected, but is still far from what we would consider a true villain.  It caught me by surprise about halfway through how I was so fascinated by a crook with little or no moral values.  I suppose this is how we live out our own bit of villainy.  Overall, a fun read that may possibly help you appreciate the film even more
