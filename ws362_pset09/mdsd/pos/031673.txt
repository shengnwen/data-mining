This book is certainly one of its kind in presenting an important aspect of the Arabic language not well covered in the standard books on Arabic grammar. Each chapter begins with a text for reading highlighting some connectors that will be then discussed in detail. A translation of the text is provided. Each chapter has numerous examples followed by exercises. 
The utility of the book can be increased by providing vocabulary and key to the exercises for someone studying the book without a teacher
