This is a good resource if you are thinking of visiting New York City.  Frommer's is another resource, too.

However, this volume has a number of very important pluses.  For one thing, there are well detailed maps of different parts of the city.

For another, there are very helpful maps of museums.  For instance, the floor plan map of the American Museum of Natural History would be most useful for people wanting to explore this facility.  Just so with a map of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  And so on.

As with other publications, there are sections on hotels, restaurants, shopping, entertainment, etc.  Very well done in this volume.  The problem, of course, is that there is much change.  Restaurants come and go; the same with other facilities.  Nonetheless, this volume provides enough depth that such matters are only secondary.

All in all, this is a good reference for those who are thinking of visiting New York City
