Jennifer Rose has sworn off Blonde men due to the pain they had caused her, until she sees Richard Markham.  She bids on him at an auction and gets more than dinner. She does not think of herself as an attractive woman because she is full figured.

Rick has always dated Model-type slender women until he goes out with Jennifer and discovers the joy that can be derived from an ample woman.  He is hooked. They spend a lot of steamy time together until something happens to make them break up. How will they get back together?  Both are stubborn and though they pine for one another, someone has to give in first.

There is a lot of wonderful tantalizing sex in this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
