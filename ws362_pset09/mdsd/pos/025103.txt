Secrets of Happily Married Men is a tantalizing title that's guaranteed to grab everyone's attention.  But, c'mon "happily married men"  -- do they really exist?  Actually, yes, according to Scott Haltzman and there could be more if you follow his eight steps.  This book accomplishes the monumental feat of empowering men without disempowering women.  Haltzman uses research to show that men and women are indeed different - not better, not worse - just different.  Once he gets that established, it's on to showing men that they have the innate tools to make their marriages work.  He carefully points out how women are different and explains to men how they can use their own natural skills, many of which they use quite successfully at work.  So forget marriage therapy.  

	This book is a great resource for men who may be feeling incompetent in their own marriages.  It is written in a highly accessible style, through which Haltzman's sense of humor is readily apparent.  Men will appreciate the down-to-earth, common sense approach.  The excerpts from real men and women who have contributed to his website secretsofmarriedmen.com nicely illustrate the frustrations that married couples face.  Haltzman will admit that there's no miracle cure, but men do have what it takes to make their own marriages succeed.  Most important, not only will they make their wives happier, they'll become happier themselves in the process.  This book should be on every married man's shopping list!  And their wives should read it, too!
