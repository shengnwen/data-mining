This is an excellent book, one that is so vital to the field of Russian History. The study of Russian history is problemmatic; historians have had all sorts of biases (nationalist, communist, anti-nationalist, etc, etc...) going back centuries that make finding out the real story (if we'll ever know what that was) very difficult. Ostrowski has taken a step back from all these prejudices to try and revise/rewrite early (Muscovite--14th-16th c.) Russian history in an open-minded rational way. It is a book of high scholarly caliber--his thorugh work proven by his responsible documentation (footnotes). Anyone who wants less footnotes and more fluff, non-scholarly reading (in response to LaugingLion's review below) is welcome to find it elsewhere.
