I love the way this book has sections in the beginning of each chapter with such basics as boning a chicken or making rich pan gravy.  I made the Beef Tenderloin with Wild Mushrooms twice and all I can say is WOW!!  My family loved it and the leftovers were gone in a day.  My next venture is Cream of Broccoli Soup which sounds really yummy.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to make great meals without having to search all over for strange ingredients. Your grocery store should have anything you need
