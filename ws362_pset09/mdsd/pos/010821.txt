I travel a lot and a Lonely Planet book of my destination is always in my carry-on. This SF book was very helpful for my sister and I who recently went on a 'girls shopping weekend' up there (from the L.A. area). We did manage to find all the great shops (thanks to the 'Shopping' section) and then have time for some sightseeing on the side. All the directions, maps, addresses, opening times, admission costs, etc. were accurate and precise. The transportation maps are especially helpful in a city like San Francisco where a rental car is not only not necessary but can definitely be a burden (not much parking!). The book also provided interesting facts about historical sites such as Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. I recommend this book to anyone who is traveling to San Francisco whether it be for a weekend or a month or anywhere in between. There is enough stuff in this book to keep you busy, I promise! And it's very easy to use and has a nice Index in the back where everything is possible to find =
