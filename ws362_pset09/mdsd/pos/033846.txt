If you're looking for an easy reading abridgement of the Institutes, this is an excellent choice.  I enjoyed getting an overview of Calvin's work during devotions and before bed without having to think too hard about &quot;translating the translation&quot; which is so often the case with older translations.  The fact of the matter is that there are other abridgements that may do the trick also, but this one does just fine for me.  I'll read it again and again.  So, if you want a overview of Calvin's Institutes without having to deal with the &quot;intricate&quot; details, think about this one... if you want an exhaustive history/biography of his life and works, obviously this won't do it for you
