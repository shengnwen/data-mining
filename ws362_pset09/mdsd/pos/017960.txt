The Ramona Quimby books are a great series of books.  Ramona Quimby, Age 8 is a great book too.  I love Picky; Picky the cat. If you knew me well enough, you would know that I love cats and Picky, Picky is a gentle cat. He does not like to be near noise. I don't blame him.  If I were the author of this book, I would pick the same characters.  I would die for the series of Ramona Quimby books.
