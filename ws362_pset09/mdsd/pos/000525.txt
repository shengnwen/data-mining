I checked this book out of the library as much as I could get away when I was a kid. My local library burned when I was in high school, and one of the library staff asked if there was anything I wanted as a souvenir. I asked for one thing, "Big Susan'. I still have the book and read it to my niece last night.  I still love this book so much. It is the one childhood book I would grab in a fire. And I became a children's librarian.
