This book completely changed my understanding and level of jazz piano playing.  It is short and to the point, yet carefully written and complete.    I like the fact that the author is a trained engineer.  As a computer  programmer I can identify with the way the book is layed out very logically  with the assumption that the reader is intelligent, interested,  and  motivated.  I read the entire book while on trains going to and from work.   I think it would have been a distraction to have read it while at a piano.       The chord pattern excercises at the end of the book are excellent; I am  methododically going through all of them using a PC based sequencer  connected via midi to an electronic keyboard.    If you only buy one book  on jazz piano, I think it should be this one.       The next book to read  after this one, in my opinion is &quot;All about Chords&quot;.  I am almost  finished reading it;  I could never have handled it if I hadn't read  &quot;Modern Jazz Piano&quot; first. The two books together are  magnificently complete.     I have a quite a library of jazz piano and jazz  books; most of them are padded and not of much use.  &quot;Modern Jazz  Piano&quot; is by contrast a classic that every jazz pianist should have.        I lost many years because I was brain-washed into believing the John  Mehegan jazz system as taught at Julliard was the only way to learn jazz. I  now believe the Julliard system is hopelessly complicated and not  effective.  The traditional harmony systems used in &quot;Modern Jazz  Piano&quot; are the best and also the most popular.  It is not something  esoteric that only propeller heads know about.   Buy it and hold onto it.   Even if it sits on your bookshelf for years, there will come a day when it  will speak eloquently to you and change your level of playing and  understanding
