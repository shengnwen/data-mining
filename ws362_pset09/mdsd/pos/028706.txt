I feel sorry for those reviewers here that can't or won't enjoy this book.
What a great way to pass a few hours time. Sure it was full of expletives, but that is the way a few of these characters would think and talk. It was a great take on the seedier side of life and wasn't meant to be anything but funny. I've read the book twice and own the DVD, which really isn't that bad, unless you compare it to the book, which is unfair about most movies adapted from good books. The movie had the misfortune of having its original release date scheduled for shortly after 9/11, and that certainly would not have worked with a plane highjacking at the end, but I digress. So I'll digress further, I recently listened to Dave Barry give an excellent performance of this book on cassette, and it stood up well there, too. If you're not an absolute prude, read this book and enjoy the romp. It's funny. End of story
