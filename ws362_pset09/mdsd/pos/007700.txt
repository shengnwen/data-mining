 "Finding Your Strengths" may be Marcus Buckingham's finest work to date. Buckingham and Clifton have succeeded in bringing to life an idea that is enormously practical and helpful.  Using themes as a means of describing one's gifts, Buckingham and Clifton have given me enormous insights about who I am and why I do the things I do. More importantly, they have taught me not only to accept my weaknesses but how to management both my strengths and weaknesses, so that, I can learn to be better than anyone else in my strengths.  Thank you Marcus and Donald.
