Glad I got around to reading this one. I have a soft spot for Arianna. I can't tell if she's completely for real but she seems pretty damned sincere. I was fired up when I read page after page of disgusting corporate greed laid out in excruciating detail. She calls them as she sees them. At a certain point I was overwhelmed by all the sick practices that rob us blind. I had to stop reading for a while because it was all so depressing. I know these things exist, I'm really aware of it but reading in black and white got to me. A good book to own a use as a reference.
