Bizarrely, for a Dahl story, there are no grisly deaths, no giant bugs and no magic. A giraffe, a pelican and a monkey open a ladderless window cleaning company, and eventually a young boy gets to open his own candy store. A great big oversized book (mine is, the new one's not), full of terrific drawings and much fun
