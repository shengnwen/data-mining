Another book on the obvious and commonsense, but still worth your time for its unique perspective on the influence of the outside world on families and possible responses. It is well conceived and put together. Still, it  should be read in bits to prevent good idea overload. And it will remind  you of things you've heard before. But read it...it will open your eyes and  heart to new ways of thinking, above all being the premise that you NEED TO  KNOW YOUR KID
