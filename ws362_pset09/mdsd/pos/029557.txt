This is a wonderful book, if for no other reason other than that it has the recipe for Moose Head Gingerbread, made with black pepper and mustard. It is a baker's handbook, and has many of the basics that you will need. It is a great companion to Marion's other book the Fanny Farmer Cookbook. Recommend that you buy the pair
