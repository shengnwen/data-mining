If you want your child to really understand the history of musical instruments, this book is a good place to start.  It's more like a concise, nicely illustrated children's textbook than a story book, but could certainly hold the interest of a child who wants to learn about what's  behind the music.  It's probably most appropriate for 6-9 year olds
