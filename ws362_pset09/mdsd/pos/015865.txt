I don't claim that this one is the rollicking, laughter filled ride of most of the previous books (particularly WYRD SISTERS) but, for sheer inventiveness and looney logic, this has claimed its current spot in my head and heart as King of the Hill as far as Discworld novels are concerned. However, I am reading or re-reading the series in order published, so it will likely change. Camels. Who would've thought? Highest recommendations.
