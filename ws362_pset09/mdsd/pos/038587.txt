This cook book is great for cooking with your kids and anyone else. Whether you are planning for a snack with your friends or just making food for a party or anything else. It has easy step by step directions, and it tells you what utensils are needed and if it safe for your child to do it all by themselves. I recommend this book for anyone who is interestede in cooking. It is great fun!!!!!
