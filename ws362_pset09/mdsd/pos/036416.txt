You want to know what MBA's learn? But, you know you can't spend 2 years and a fortune to acquire that knowledge? Fear not! The 10 day MBA is your mini-MBA course. You wouldn't learn everything that the MBA student learns in those 2 years, but, you would learn almost all the essential concepts.

Author Steven Silbiger presents all the concepts of taught in most b-schools in a very readable format. A definite must-read for all managers, entrepreneurs and the hopeful millions who see themselves managing their own or somebody else's business very soon.

Now the complaint (or rather the justification for 4* instead of a 5*): The author probably presents the material in the SAME SEQUENCE that he studied it during his b-school years. This makes the book a collection of essays on the various topics of business management rather than an integrated approach to business management. I would love to see a more integrative approach on how the various concepts mesh together in real-world business situations
