When I started my endevour to read presidential biographies I had no interest in LBJ - he did not seem very interesting or appealing to me.  After just a few pages of this stellar book I was riveted.  It turns out that LBJ, though a vile man, is one of the most compelling stories of American political history.  The book is as well written as any I have ever read (and I've read quite a few).  I could not wait to read volume 2
