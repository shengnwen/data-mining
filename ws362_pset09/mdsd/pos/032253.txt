If you like Batman, chances are at one time in your life you have thought about what it would be like to be involved in his line of work.  Therefore, this book is for all Batman fans!  I'd say it was a quick read, because I read the whole thing the day I got it, but seriously I was not keeping track of the time because I was so engaged in the book!  A nice mix of fact and fun, it convinced me I could be Batman!  Cool diagrams, insights into the character of Batman as well as his training, tactics, and abilities.  I loved this thing and would recommend it to any comic reader
