I am a convert....Further I just don't have any neurons to spare at my age. You've got to die from something, but I'd prefer to die of something less exotic..eg shot by a jealous husband.  Seriously, getting off aspartame completely stopped my tinnitus and dizziness.

The most interesting story is how Donald Rumsfeld (yes the same guy)
pushed nutra sweet thru the FDA against all opinions within the FDA.
It was approved just days after Reagan took office..
