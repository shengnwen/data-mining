Bill Belleville's sublime story of the St. John's River was a book I could not put down.  A modern version of William Bartram's Travels, &quot;River of Lakes&quot; truly catches the history, geology and flavor of life along the St. John's River.  For those of us who have grown up on the river, and who have played in its creeks and springs since childhood, it was an absolute joy to read.  I hope that Belleville (who also makes films about rivers) makes a film about the St. John's based on this book.  Hang up your hammock by the river, sit back and soak up the beauty of this poetic odyssey.  If you haven't seen the St. John's before, you will want to now
