I read the 10-Minute Clutter Control (Easy Feng Shui Tips for Getting Organized) before trying this book. That one was easier to grasp, but this one expanded my understanding of placing the grid on my living space. I didn't quite grasp how to use the trigrams in this book though. 
The book gives about five pages talking about each room, then gives a page of brief tips to get you started. 
Some of the tips seem so obvious, that you wonder what all the hype is about. It does make you take a new look at your surroundings and creates a desire to improve on it. 
It was useful to me and is a book that I'll sample now and then to give me a fresh perspective on a room and its layout
