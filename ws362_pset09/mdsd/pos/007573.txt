This is the first-person story of Maureen Johnson Smith, red-haired Missouri beauty and free spirit, and the mother of Woodrow Wilson Smith, a/k/a Lazarus Long (among many other aliases), the longest-lived member of the human species. The first three-quarters of the book isn't really "science fiction," but it's all 100% Heinlein. It's also the author's last-written work before his death in 1988 and in many ways it almost reads as if Heinlein knew that would be the case. The Johnson/Smith family is rather unusual, even for one of the early Howard families, and they're all surrogates, in one way or another, for the author's fully developed social ideas and opinions -- but every reader of Heinlein knows that will be the case. Read _Time Enough for Love_ (which its narrative line largely parallels) before you tackle this one
