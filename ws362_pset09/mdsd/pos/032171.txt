Oded Shenkar's book is a fascinating read with a powerful message: The Chinese Century is coming and there's not much we can do about it.  

China is developing at a remarkable pace. They add 4 to 6 million cell phone subscribers every month - over a year they would be adding as many as the entire cell phone market of United Kingdom!  The Chinese are building municipal infrastructure every month that is the equivalent of a Houston, Texas.  China attracts the biggest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world and is buying 7% of the world's oil! In facts most of the Fortune 500 CEOs seemed more optimistic about the Chinese economy than the American economy.  

This book is a conversation-starter. It's a conversation about the future of the global economy and your role there. Everybody who concerned about America's place in the 21st century must read this book, because 21st century might well be known as the Chinese Century..
