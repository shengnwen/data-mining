There is something strangely comforting about reading the bad review posted above, from Publisher's Weekly, and knowing that it refers to one of the greatest anthologies of horror literature published in the last fifty years.  Just goes to show you that even the best writers in this genre are inevitably misunderstood:  Here we have a man in the same league as Blackwood, M. R. James, Lovecraft or Poe--and he's still being dismissed in his own lifetime by TOTAL DUMMIES.

But Ligotti is certainly appreciated, at least by some.  There is a published THOMAS LIGOTTI READER...despite the fact that almost all his books are out of print.  His signed first editions are already priced like horror artifacts, and increasingly hard to come by.

Personally, if I had any signed first edition of Ligotti's, it would be SONGS.  There is a tangible loneliness to the horror, an emotional dimension.  The ending of ALICE'S LAST ADVENTURE, for instance, is simultaneously terrifying AND enormously sad.  And a wry sense of humor is also present in this particular collection, though it's not remotely comforting--quite the opposite in fact.  Something about the world of Ligotti's stories being so unforgivingly funny just makes it MORE threatening.  Like his characters are caught up in a particularly cruel 'cosmic joke'.

Now it's also true that something about this first collection is more traditional than Ligotti's later work, and that turns off some of the die-hard Ligottians (who understandably prefer the lyric otherworldiness of his recent collections).  But that also means SONGS is the best place to get introduced to this remarkable author.

Linguistically complex, structurally virtuosic and just plain brilliant.  If you're thinking of reading SONGS, do it right now.  You'll become a fan overnight, I promise
