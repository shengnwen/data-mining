Creative yet practical ways to motivate and retain staff are needed now more than ever before.  Between the sour economy that makes raises and bonuses tougher, the specter of layoffs that's making everyone nervous, the ability of top staff to bail on you at a moment's notice, and the trend toward making managers accountable for employee retention, managers can never let down their guard in this area.  Many of the ideas here are common sense, but can never be restated enough.  Others are low-cost and can be implemented with the leanest of budgets.  My one quibble with the book:  the suggestion to have executives spend a day with the staff is, IMHO, insulting to the rank and file and may even be counterproductive, as it comes off as more of a feel-good stunt benefitting the executives than a real motivator
