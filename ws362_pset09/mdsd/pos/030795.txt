Loved this book: really great theories and speculations. DO NOT read if you have not read all of the Harry Potter books, because it contains MAJOR SPOILERS. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because although it's an excellent book and very well-written, it does seem to veer towards other theories more than others (e.g. Harry is a Horcrux, R.A.B. is Regulus Black, etc.). And even though it gives genuinely plausible theories for both sides (besides the Snape is good/bad issue), it doesn's say, "We believe that Harry is a Horcrux." It says, "Harry is a Horcrux." So if the book was a little less adamant about certain things, I would have given it 5 stars; but it's still a great book nonetheless.
