See synopsis above.

Its seems the Nano-tech thriller is becoming quite popular and Patrick Larkin does a great job with this one. ('Nano' by John Robert Marlow was also a good nanotech thriller).
I thought it was an exciting read and it kept me enthralled to the end. I don't seem to remember any slow spots in the whole novel. Good from beginning to end.

Highly recommended
