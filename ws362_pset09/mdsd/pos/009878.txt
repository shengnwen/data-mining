I have never read any works by Jeffrey Deaver, even though I have a couple of his books sitting my shelf. I had no idea what type of stories were contained in this collection, but after reading the first two stories, I got it. Of all the stories, I only guessed the ending on one of them, which makes this collection a good read. Like another reader, the Lincoln Rhyme short story was a miss for me.

These are mainly mystery stories that have a twisted ending. It always amazes me when someone can write a short story and in such a few words really TELL a story. I have bought 2 copies to give as gifts. 

This book would be a good starting book for someone who does not normally read the genre or who may have a shorter attention span. I gave it to my husband to read, but he didn't like it as much as I did. I think it's more because he likes alternative history-type books versus mystery and suspense. Definitely a keeper
