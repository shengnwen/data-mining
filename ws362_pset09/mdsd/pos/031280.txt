I really love Wanda.  I'm sure what I'm about to write won't differ too much from other reviews, because unfortunately what I'm about to say and what others have said is the truth.  She isn't as funny on paper as she is on stage or tv.  I love her points of view on all subject matter in the book - dating, football etc, and I can just imagine hearing her say all this 'in person', so for me, that's what's funny about the book.  I give it only four stars instead of five because it needs to be an audio cassette version to make it go from funny to totally hillarious
