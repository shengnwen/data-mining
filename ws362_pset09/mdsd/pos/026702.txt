Remember the feeling that parents don't understand because they lived in a differently? Remember being so frustrated and confused and having no idea what to do? In Amy Tan's novel "The Kitchen God's wife" she introduces situations that people can relate too. The cultural differences between succeeding generations of immigrant families in America cause many conflicts. If the families are to advance in their new country, it is critical that the cultural barriers be brought down through communication, understanding, and compromise. Winnie and her daughter Pearl face the generation gap. Pearl, being raised in America, is American while her mother is stuck with the old Chinese ways. Throughout the book, one learns the reason her mother is the way she is, the secrets her mother keeps, and the lies her mother has told. As the story continues, Pearl and her mother become closer because the cultural barrier separating the two is slowly coming down. Because Winnie is communicating with her daughter, Pearl becomes understanding and compromises with her mother. One learns the best way to be rid of a cultural wall is to always communicate, understand, and compromise. I recommend this book to people who have experienced what Pearl and Winnie have and to people who enjoy a book that completely grabs one's attention. Reading this book is like a drug. Once one begins, one can't stop.
