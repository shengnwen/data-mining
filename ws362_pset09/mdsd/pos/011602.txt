When one reads the truth about what goes on in Saudi Arabia one has to ponder 'why should it exist?'  Why, in the 21st century, should a place like this exist?  A place where women may not drive, may no leave the home without permission, may not attend colleges(that are usually U.S colleges supporting this disgusting discrimination), a place where certain sections in stores are 'off limits to women'.  

A place where a small family controls a country, where minorities are raped and beheaded, where forieng workers are treated like slaves, where sex slaves are actually imported from the west to feed an insatiable lust by a ruling class that has divided the sexes and forced everyone to be 'moral' so that it can enjoy the worst forms of immorality.

Such a place could only be imagined, in hell maybe, and yet it exists just next door, and it is one of the U.S's best allies, a place where leading schools and journalists and 'liberal's support and coddle.  The most educated and rich Saudis are the least liberal.  Not a suprise.  An explosive book, that will rattle you to the bone, unfortunatly the author didnt speak to any women(that is forbidden) and this takes away from the value of the book.
