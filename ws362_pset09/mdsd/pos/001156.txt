Focuses mainly on do's and don't of kit installation. 

Has good info on basic turbo setup and intercooler selection. Would have been nice if the book contained more info on custom manufacturing of intercoolers and exhaust manifolds (forming end tanks and size to exhaust velocity vs tube type exhaust and construction). As well as selecting the correct BOV. 

Overall, great information for beginning turbo quester and a recommended read
