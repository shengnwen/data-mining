College-level students of culinary and feminist studies won't want to miss the unusual history in From Betty Crocker To Feminist Food Studies: Critical Perspectives On Women And Food: it gathers scholarly essays from a range of disciplines to address issues of economics, society and culture in food history, using gender as its foundation. Thirteen essays are arranged under four headings by history, representations, marketplace and resistances, following the history of scholarly food writing and feminist food studies. From studies on the influence of large corporations in determining what made up a proper meal in this country to surveys on how women have kept families nourished, essays consider race, gender, and social identity as it relates to food.
