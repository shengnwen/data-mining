All too often, I buy a cookbook and try two or three recipes at the most. Although the recipes usually sound good, they are often either time-consuming or not something that the whole family would enjoy - in one word, impractical. The Vegetarian Family Cookbook by Nava Atlas is not one of those cookbooks. Rather, here is a cookbook that I can actually use on a weekly basis. In fact, if (for some strange reason) I could keep in my possession only a few cookbooks, this would be one of them. 

In particular, I like this cookbook because it includes recipes for healthy meals I can cook for our toddler without having to make separate dishes for the rest of the family.
 
I consider the author of The Vegetarian Family Cookbook, Nava Atlas, a pioneer: She's raised a vegetarian family. She knows what works, and what's healthy, and she's compiled it all in this book for the rest of us to benefit from!
