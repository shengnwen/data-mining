I like western books.  It's been awhile since I've read L'amour or Grey but I like 'em.  Hence my hesitation for years to read Lonesome Dove.  Maybe the Pulitzer thing intimidated me but I was afraid of some overwritten plodding tomb of hard words I would be forced to look up.

I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked it a lot.  Gus, while no Atticus Finch, may be one of my all time favorite literary characters.  There is action, a little romance, and cowboys and Indians! There is even very funny and very sad.  Oh yeah, and a little bit of beautiful.  Ultimately there is also Lonesome. 

Great great story-much more than just a western-and I only had to look up one word.  The word describing their sign. You'll get a laugh.  The ball's in your court.
