A solid explanation of what happened in the Balkan's vis--vis US foreign policy. When reading books on recent  history or current events I try to take into account the author's political bias and maintain vigilance for hidden agendas.   Mr. Hablerstam's book appears to be an even-handed treatment of the subject. Like many Americans, I struggled for understanding of  the events in media accounts of the conflict. This book was written in an easily understandable and engaging style.  It offers about as thorough an understanding of the Balkan crisis that can be accomplished in a single volume. I highly recommend this book.
