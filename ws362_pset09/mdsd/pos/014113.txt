I've always had questions about heaven... where is it?  What is it?  I've wondered if it were possibly another dimension.  I had heard snippets of ideas about heaven but nothing concrete.  This book has stirred up so much excitement within me... I never dreamed heaven might be the way Kevin Alcorn describes it.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know.  Since I read it a couple of weeks ago, I don't think I've had a single conversation that hasn't ended up discussing heaven... the place and the book.  This book has given me new hope and determination to do whatever it takes to carry on in my Christian walk and to encourage others to come with me.
