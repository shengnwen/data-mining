Rose Keefer did a great job on the book "The man who got away." The only problem I saw with this book, is it was mistitled ... It is one of the best books I have ever read about the overall crime history of Chicago, but it took 204 pagess to get to the "Bugs" part. Once you reach the last chapter, it seems the author was in a hurry to finish it leaving so many questions unaswered.
