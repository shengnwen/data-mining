Savannah Breeze is a fun-filled sequel to Savannah Blues which I have not read (yet).  Regardless of not knowing the previous story, BeBe's story was easy to jump into and you never feel too lost not knowing the characters previously.  BeBe Loudermilk, a three time divorcee' has found herself in another humiliating situation: a man posed as the perfect man and managed to perfectly leave her without anything besides the clothes on her back, the car she was driving, her restaurant that she can't afford to keep open and... the Breeze Motel.  With nothing else to loose, BeBe heads out to the Breeze and finds Hank, the cranky manager and a hotel that is in needs of lots of work - work she can't redily afford.

This novel is a great fun to read and I found myself flying through the pages.  The things that happen to BeBe somewhat seem a bit farfetched but Mary Kay Andrews tells it so simply and honestly that it seems that you could be reading the story of your friend who found herself in a pickle.  A typical chick-lit book but a fun ride
