This book is an excellent reference a gives a deep idea of many aspects of  digital communication. At the beginning (chapter 1) the statistical theory  is discussed, then the digitally modulated signals and their power and  spectral characteristics are analyzed. Then it goes deeper in advanced  matters.  I found this book excellent, even if it can be tough to read for  people without a good math background or previous knowledge in the field.  Anyway if you are interest in looking for particular reference it is really  excellent and gives also a brief about where to go for further info at the  end of each chapter. Definitely not for undergraduate students looking for  a basic idea, but very good for a deeper mathematical approach. It think  everyone who works in this field should have a copy
