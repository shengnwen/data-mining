I was intrigued to read this book when I learned the biographer was prevented from appearing on ABC's Good Morning America by Arnold's publicist, the all powerful Pat Kingsley.  It is a well researched and written book with no agenda.  I held back a star because his journey to America was fascinating and the hunt is more exciting than the kill.  It made me respect him more what sacrifices he made to come to this country and I pass no judgement about being a "boy toy" to a septegerian Spanish prince as a means to get out of Austria.  Even it was only posing, and no touching.  He used whatever he had to get to America.  He has nothing to be ashamed of and his children will know if he did not do what he did they would not be here to judge him.  It was a big mistake to kill this book it will one day idemnify him as a dreamer who took action
