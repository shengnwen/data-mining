I like this book because it is a love story with mystery. I like this one because it didn't have a happy ending like most love stories. The book has some funny parts so that made it even better to read. Not being able to put the book down is the kind of book I like because it keeps me interested. Especially when I have to stop reading at a good part. Those are the reasons why I like this book. 
	The story is about a girl named Anna Sophia Lockwood but every one calls her Annie. School has ended and Annie is going to try to make her boyfriend a romantic guy. She falls back a hundred years and falls in love with a guy named Strat. Strat falls in love with her and he is the only one that knows how she got there to his time. When they try to explain it to people no one would believe them. What side of time will she choose and will it be for the right reason?
	If you like mystery then you may like this book. Also if you like romance and not being able to put the book down then you may also like this book. Do you like it to have a little bit of funny things happening in your book and all the other things I said then you just might like this book. If you happen to like this book there are three more books with the same people it and you may like those ones too.
