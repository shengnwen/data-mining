Having also read THE BUTCHER's THEATER, WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, and BLOOD TEST, this book has only encouraged me to read more of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware.  Although it moves slowly at first, the story is rich in detail and characters, and the plot develops very intellegently.  Milo Sturgis cas become more complicated and more likeable at the same time, although Robin, Alex's girlfriend, seems irrelevant.  Everyone other character emerges as a possible suspect, if even only for the reason that they are all psychologically a little OFF.  Certain parts read like a psych textbook, that's true, but it's only at a point that research becomes very important in the discovery process of the case.  This should only seem fascinating if you've been paying attention, and if you are, you might be able to figure it out only a step ahead of Dr. Delaware, whou doesn't actually get it all until the end, anyway.  Altogethor, I thought this was a terrific advancement of the series, and I can't wait to read SILENT PARTNER
