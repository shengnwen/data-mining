This book gives basics of fixed income securities in a very intuitive way. It first explains building blocks for fixed income securities. I have studied these topics in pricing and finance theory, and then I bought this book. I couldn't imagine a better explanation in such a clear way for fixed income securities. I suggest this book to everybody who wants to understand the fixed income securities. I think it helps anybody who is interested in quantitative modeling fixed income securities and who is interested in trading such securities.

It first gives the basic background, the relative pricing of fixed income securities and fixed cash flows. It then explains the price sensitivity and hedging. The author has given a good explanation for term structure models. The last part of the book is dedicated to some securities: repo, forward contracts, interest rate swaps, eurodollar and fed funds, fixed income options, mortgage-backed securities and note and bond futures
