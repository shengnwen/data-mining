Dean,..How I'd give anything to just spend a couple weeks on the road with you. Wonderful book, perhaps the most heart-wrenching book ever written in the English language, besides Grapes of Wrath. I feel I understand what "it" really is, after reading this book for the 3rd time in my life, and it's not god or anything silly like that,...it's what Sarte was driving at when he described depression as being the gulf between what is reality and what we think reality "should be"...it's the unreachable "should be" that is the all-sufficient destination. "The road is life",..choke.  Language fails me, but I felt "it" last night as I finished the book,..that point with Dean buying the little crystal from the Indian girl in southern Mexico,..the smallest purest crystal,..Yes, it is imponderable, but what a privilege to be human, to read this wonderment of human creation, to be part of "it"
