Much like Mary Gaitskill's previous novel, "Two Girls, Fat and Thin", "Veronica" is a tale of two women who forge an unlikely friendship despite differences in physicality, age and outlook. Of course, Gaitskill's hallmark, twisted sexuality is in play, joined by other sunny topics, such as aging, drugs and disease.

Gaitskill is hard to like, her writing is spare and cold, her characters are often as embraceable as shards of glass. Yet, however off-putting her subjects and subject matter, Gaitskill's talents are undeniable The reader is allowed access to interior monologues of searing acuity.

This passage shows her insightful and unsparing prose perfectly: 
"When John took those naked pictures, the most popular singer was a girl with a tiny stick body and a large deferential head, who sang in a delicious lilt of white lace and promises and longing to be close. When she shut herself up in her closet and starved herself to death, people were shocked. But starvation was in her voice all along. That was the poignancy of it. A sweet voice locked in a dark place, but focused entirely on the tiny strip of light coming under the door."

Gaitskill captures the generation (be it the blank generation or the late baby boom) who thought the world was theirs, and now realize that like Veronica and Alison, we all die sooner or later.
