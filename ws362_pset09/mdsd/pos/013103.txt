This book has two halves to it. 

The first half is rather useful introduction to a psychological theory of emotional cognition. The author consciously simplifies things to make it simple to read and understand. A designer of pretty much anything could benefit by reading it.

Sadly, the second half goes way off the course. It discusses the possible future of machines and robots, touches Azimov's laws, and simply put goes in circles. The whole second half can be summarized in a single sentence: "The intelligent robots aren't there yet, but they will be, and when they are, humanity is changed to accomodate".

The design of the book itself is marvellous (who'd expect ?). The language is very clear. 

Although I expected more from Mr. Norman's books, this one is just about worth reading, therefore 4 out of 5
