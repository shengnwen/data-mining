As a student, I really enjoyed how this book is very detailed, yet to the point, and also the lightness and small size of it. I learned a lot from it, and didn't have a boring time at it either.

If there are any teachers out there that are going to be teaching American Goverment - Get this book!! Your students will love you for it
