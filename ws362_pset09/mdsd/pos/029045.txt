I do not agree with 100% Stan Weinstein's trading strategy, but over all the best book on investments. His theory is just go buy set of RULES and rules work most of the time. However if you go only by rules, you may end up buying at higher price or selling at lower price as most of the people would have already jumped in by other indicators. 

However his theory is suitable for confirming the trends.
