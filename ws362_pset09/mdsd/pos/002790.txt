I can't believe that no one has reviewed this excellent book yet. This book is a collection of essays exploring the pros and cons of legalization.  The first half features essays by those who are against legalization.  Afterwards, there is a section on medical marijuana. The last part of the  book is essays opposing drug prohibition, featuring such authors as Thomas  Szasz, Milton Friedman, and Bruce Alexander. Read this book and decide for  yourself if drug legalization is necessary, or if it would be a  catastrophe
