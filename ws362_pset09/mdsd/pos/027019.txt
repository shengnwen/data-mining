Ethan Truman, an ex-homicide detective, works as chief of security for Channing "The Face" Manheim, one of the biggest Hollywood actors. Ethan is troubled by a series of packages with strange contents sent to the actor's place. Now it's up to him to solve the hidden messages in order to keep the Manheim family safe while he also has to find out how the body of his recently deceased friend Duncan "Dunny" Whistler could disappear from the hospital's morgue.

I love good mystery thrillers with supernatural elements. Dean Koontz's "The Face" didn't disappoint me in that regard. I especially like how the author used humor and rapid-fire dialogue to lighten up the darker aspects of his story. The plot quickly evolved and managed to keep my attention until the strong and satisfying end. At times Koontz's metaphors and similes were a bit too bloomy for my taste, but, overall, I truly enjoyed this first rate horror novel.
