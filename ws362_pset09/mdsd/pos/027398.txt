This is a very thorough and detailed guide to what seems like every aspect of hydronic heating. Both theory and practical application advice are included. It is also indispensable as a ready reference for particular problems you are seeking solutions for. The cd rom included has many useful tools for estimating and calculating heating system requirements (there is one tiresome limitation - the cd rom does not run on MacOS. At the price paid for the package, it should!). Otherwise highly recommended
