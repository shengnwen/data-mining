Don't let the questionable cover art put you off! Skinner is a highly inventive and action packed science fiction novel set on the very alien planet of SplatterJay. Based in Asher's Polity universe, Skinner reads like something Iain Banks might have written after going out and getting raging drunk. Asher successfuly crossbreeds the high concept science fiction we've come to expect from the new wave of British SF writers with nonstop action, interesting characters and weird lifeforms. This is the third Asher novel I've read, and I'm looking forward to more from this talented writer
