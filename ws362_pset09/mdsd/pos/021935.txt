Buchanon does a great job putting to paper his opinions on his research.  The book reads as a great novel would and you can actually become excited while reading it.  

He gives his analysis on certain things and persons.  I agree with much, but disagree on some.  However, his arguements are very well developed and I can at least say I respect his opinions on those he did write about. 

His analysis on loyalist vs whig militia I find flawed and not at all accurate in anything past the comments on leaders.  He does not go much into the reason I find responsible for the difference...excperience.  It is just plain to see that the loaylists spent most of the war hiding in the back country and lacked the experience in the field that the rebels and their leaders had gained.  It has nothing to do with fighting spirit as he implies. 

The desciption of Cowpens and Guildford are outstanding.  I find his detailed accounts of the partisan battles fascinating and never before covered with such depth.  He finds many personal written accounts that are not seen in many other studies.  

Buchanon gets major kudos for taking on such a large prject and delivering as well as he does.  Not many other writers can make a book of this size go so quickly.  This is a great read for the advanced student or the novice and it matters not what side you favor in your studies to enjoy it.
