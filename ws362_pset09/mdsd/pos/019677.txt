Bravo for Mr. Herman!  His perspective on the affect of the British raj and, in particular, the navy on the development of the Western world is excellent and educational.  The phenomenon of a relatively small nation exerting its influence around the globe by extending its power through a superbly constructed and manned navy is, as yet, unmatched.  For fully two centuries, until World War II finally exhausted the potential, the British policy of open sea lanes and its enforcement thereof permitted the development of the New World through trade with the Old. This includes the United States, whose loss as a colony severely dented the Empire, but eventiually created the power which has succeeded Britain as world guarantor.

Mr. Herman is good on detail, but the real strength of the book is his explanation of how naval development and use affected the world as a whole. He is candid about the problems, both physical and political, and respectful of those individuals who, even in bad times, retained the foresight to keep the navy, and, thus, the Empire, on an even keel.

An excellent read for anyone interested in Western history
