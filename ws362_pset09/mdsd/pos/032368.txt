This is a very good book that serves as a valuable addition to the canon of works exploring the phenomenon that is Stephen King.  I would heartily recommend it to people who are King fans and who also like to read critical analysis of his stories.

This book focuses on the films that have resulted from King novels and stories.  Magistrale's best readings here are of Kubrick's "The Shining" and Darabont's "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile," but he has something interesting to say about pretty much every movie he covers (which is not every single King film, unfortunately).

There are a few places where the book falls down a bit, though.  For example, Magistrale seems to be convinced that the only version of Tobe Hooper's "Salem's Lot" that is commerically available is the truncated version released to theaters overseas.  In fact, his entire criticsm is based on that edition.  I've owned the complete four-hour version (three hours, actually, since the commericals aren't included) on DVD for several years.  It's readily available from any online mercant, and has been for a long time now.  How that simple fact managed to slip by Magistrale is a mystery to me, but it is the sort of ridiculous error that makes me wonder how many other things he might have gotten wrong.

Also, for a book that, I think, tries to be a critical overview of Stephen King movies, there are far too many digressions to discuss how things were done in the novel on which the respective movie was based.  If one of Magistrale's points is that the King film canon is deserving of serious critical attention, then it is a disservice to constantly return to a discussion of how the novels are different.

Still, this is one of the better books of criticism I've read on the subject of Stephen King.  I recommend it
