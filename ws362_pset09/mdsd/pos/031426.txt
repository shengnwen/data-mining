*The Autobiography of Santa Claus* was a good read with some interesting "explanations" of how Santa came to be as well as some Christmas traditions.  There are numerous references to Christ, which emphasizes the true meaning of Christmas.  Attached to the autobiography are "revised" historical tidbits.

The story immediately opens with Nicholas, about 300 years after Christ, coming from a wealthy family but soon becomes an orphan.  Due to his generous nature and powers of observation, Nicholas begins his local gift-giving in secret.  Within a short amount of time, his gift-giving expands beyond his hometown.  Within centuries, it becomes global.

His initial gift-giving has given him immortality, which is passed on to others who have joined Santa.  Those who have joined him are his wife, Layla, Attila the Hun, Arthur (whom we have designated as King), Leonardo da Vinci, Theodore Roosevelt, Martin Luther, Amelia Earhart and a few others.  Some of these people interesting to see how they have joined Santa's team.  Other people were a little difficult to swallow to see that they have joined with Santa, such as Attila.

Throughout the autobiography, explanations are given on how some Christmas traditions have started.  Traditions included stocking hanging, chimneys, *Silent Night*, *'Twas the Night Before Christmas*, *A Christmas Carol*, the flying reindeer and the sleigh, Santa as the big jolly man, the North Pole, and many more.

The story pretty much covered everything, except one thing.  I wished that Jeff Guinn included the origin of Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.  I believe that would have a wonderful conclusion of Santa's autobiography.

Overall, it was a good read, perfect for the Christmas season
