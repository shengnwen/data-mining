 This book has a lot of step-by-step instr. that was very helpful to a novice. It goes into how to trace, the use of the colors, clipping(snipping), tools and paper.
 I would consider it along with Carla Larter's: Parchment Craft to be a COMPLETE and THOROUGH help and class in this field.
 I am glad reading the reviews before me - save me from bying the same book with just different covers. I bought them both used, and they were new!        Sincerely Lind
