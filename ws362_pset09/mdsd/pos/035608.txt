I've read several books of this type and to date this is the best one.  I've also read several of the critiques of this work by those who hold to the King James ONLY position and find their position contradictory and severely lacking scholarship.  This book is scholarly where it needs to be and readable when it needs to be - in contrast to the bulk of those who criticize it.  I commend the book for those who are desireous of an introduction to this vital subject
