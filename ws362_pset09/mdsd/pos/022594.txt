Dear Reader,

The unfortunate Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, were last seen driving away from the horrible Prufrock Preparatory School where their dear friends, the Quagmire triplets, Duncan and Isadora, where kidnapped by Count Olaf all because they had helped the Baudelaire's.  Fortunately, Mr. Poe finds a young couple willing to take in the three orphaned children:  Jerome and Esme Squalor.

Jerome seems like a nice enough fellow.  However, his wife Esme is rather strange, eccentric, and pretentious.  Jerome is fine except when Esme is around.  Then he seems incapable of thinking for himself and he submits to her every wish.

The Baudelaires don't seem in as much danger as usual in this story (but they are always in danger).  However, there is a very long staircase, a false elevator, and a brief reunion with some very dear friends; the Quagmires!  Oh, but that's when the danger is revealed.  Poor Violet, Klaus, and Sunny discover they were playing into Count Olaf's hands all along.  Not since A BAD BEGINNING has Olaf been so sneaky.  It's all too terrible to talk about anymore.  Read about it for yourself if you wish.

I'm going to fix a tuna sandwich on the gas stove.

Sincerely,

Uncle T
