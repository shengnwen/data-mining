I used this text book in an Introduction to Management course in College.  I felt that the text did a great job explaining the different concepts and functions of management.  The examples made it easy to understand.  I also felt that the exhibits were very helpful and easy to understand.  The tables and diagrams were all easy to interrupt.  I also found the end of the chapter summaries very useful.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who has an interest in understanding the basic fundamentals of management
