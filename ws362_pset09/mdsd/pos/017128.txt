In Fair Land, Fair Land, A.B. Guthrie wrapped up the Old West part of his 6 novel series of the West. Guthrie had actually skipped over the period from 1845 to 1870 when he originally went from The Way West to These Thousand Hills. He was later convinced in 1982 to go back and finish the tale of Dick Summers. 

Guthrie places Summers in an extended autumn both of his own life and that of the old Indian way of life. Although Summers is over 70 by the end of the tale, he never really quite gets old - just a little 'ganted up'. Summers finds love with Teal Eye (Boone Caudill's foolishly rejected spouse) and companionship with Higgins - Hig - as they drift along in an idyllic life (if living on the prairie in the shadow of the Montana mountains can really be an idyll). Summers also meets up with his former trail mate Boone Caudill for a reckoning over Caudill's murder of Jim Deakins, but that denouement becomes almost anti-climactic.

The telling is somewhat uneven (a stint living in a gold mining town seems like something stuck on to the story for no particular good reason), but Guthrie's love of Montana is evident in his description of the Bitteroot Valley. I literally was looking for an atlas to see just where this beautiful place was (and is).

But the idyll does come to an end. The game gradually gets harder and harder to find, whites intrude more closely, and finally the soldiers come to establish a fort. The book ends with the Marias River Massacre. Perhaps the worst slaughter of Indians by the US Army, the history is related in Larry McMurtry's recent offering 'Oh, What a Slaughter'. Guthrie includes the shouted warning by one of the white scouts 'wrong camp!', but the soldiers don't really care and shoot down these peaceable Piegan Blackfoot because they were at hand and the hostiles had already fled.

There's no way to make of this era a happy story and Guthrie doesn't try. A fine ending to the Dick Summers trilogy. Highly recommended.
