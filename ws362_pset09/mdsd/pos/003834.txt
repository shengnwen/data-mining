Whether the real estate bubble bursts or not, many investors still believe it can make money during any market. If that's true, why isn't every real estate owner rich? Russ Whitney's THE MILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE MINDSET: MASTERING THE MENTAL SKILLS TO BUILD YOUR FORTUNE IN REAL ESTATE explores what makes some investments rich choices while others strategies are stumbling blocks. With its focus on real estate, chapters cover all the basics of what builds wealth, from the myth that raw land is worthless to the reality of investing in properties which can be easily sold, developed, or turned into profitable ventures. Whitney comes with credentials: he's developed his own company and education group to become a recognized leader in real estate investing, holding seminars around the world attended by some 22,000 people. His previous MILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE MENTOR was a best-seller: don't miss this one.
