I've been encountering a few paranormal experiences of late and never really understood what I was going through until my boyfriend recommended I read this book.  The book was absolutely mind blowing for me because every now and then it would refer to a few things that I have experienced myself.  It got me realising that I should never let unique experiences pass without questioning or delving into the matter further.  I must say this book absolutely opened my eyes to greater potential and possibilities
