This is an important book about why societies, ancient and modern, collapse.  Given Professor Diamond's background in the environmental movement, it's no surprise that he sees the reasons as ultimately environmental.  That is, people in a culture have to choose how they will respond to their environment, and it they choose poorly, they may pay with their lives-- and the lives of everyone else.

The one thing that I see as missing in Prof. Diamond's analysis is the role of human fallibility (plain stupidity, greed, etc.) in the collapse of cultures.  When he does consider, for example, poorly conceived warfare, he sees the causes of the wars as environmental.  That's not always the way it is.

Prof. Diamond acknowledges that he used much of the material in the book in classes he taught at UCLA, and the book shows it.  That is, in many places it reads like the transcript of a lecture, complete with the signposting and internal summaries that good lecturers employ.  This, in part, is responsible for the one thing I really didn't like about the book.  An absolutely outstanding 350 page book is hiding somewhere in these 575 pages (hardback edition) of text, shouting to be set free.

In short, the book is valuable, but reading it can be a chore.
