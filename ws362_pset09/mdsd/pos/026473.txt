ICEBOUND is a unique offering from Koontz, an adventure story in the spirit of Alister McLean or Tom Clancy.  It's an enjoyable, if slightly lightweight read.

Koontz originally wrote this book under the title "Prison of Ice" under the pseudonym "David Axton" in the mid 1970s.  After Koontz became a famous writer, he re-released some of his earlier works under his own name, but only after extensively updating and rewriting them.

This book isn't Koontz' best novel by a long shot, but it's a fun read about a group of scientists trapped on a glacier that is about to explode.  This isn't a particularly realistic book, but it's fast-paced and suspenseful, especially toward the end (there is literally a ticking clock).  This is also the only novel by Koontz that resembles an old-fashioned whodunit -- there is a killer on the glacier, and the reader has to figure out which scientist is the guilty party.

I've read nearly all of Koontz's work, and this one ranks somewhere in the middle.  For a truly great Koontz novel, my advice is to try WATCHERS, PHANTOMS, LIGHTNING, INTENSITY, or ODD THOMAS instead.
