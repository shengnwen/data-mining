Like other reviewers before me, I had been a long time user of the Weber Big Book of Grilling, or the "Red Book" as it is affectionately known in our house.  As an avid griller and an avid lover of Weber Grills, I was delighted to see another entry from Jamie Purviance.  As I have previously described in my "Red Book" review, I insist that a cookbook have good recipes with incredible pictures.  Sometimes half the fun of grilling is simply flipping through the pages of "Real Grilling" and deciding what to have.  "Real Grilling" surpasses the "Red Book" by having pictures for every recipe.  I could not have asked for more!

Purviance does a nice job of providing recipes coupled with grilling and preparation tips.  For friends that I know who are finally moving their grilling past weekend hamburgers and hot dogs, this is a well received feature.

Judging by the number of food stained pages in my copy of "Real Grilling", I would say that Weber has another winner.  My only reason for giving "Real Grilling" four stars is not because of content, but because after the heavy use of my book over the past year, the pages have pulled away from the spine.  My "Red Book" never suffered this ailment.  I am disappointed that "Real Grilling" has.  I have had incredible experience with Weber customer service through the years when dealing with grill parts.  I have yet to see how things are on the publishing side of things.  Regardless, do not let this deter you from a great grilling cookbook that it also a great afternoon read.
