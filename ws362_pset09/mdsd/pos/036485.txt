I came to practice Bikram's Yoga after a studio moved into my neighborhood and my curiosity got the best of me.  It's absolutely all it promises to be, and my enthusiam for the yoga spills over to the book.

I got the most benefit from the decription of the underlying philosophy of the yoga's design, and the history of how yoga in the US evolved.  It was less immediately helpful as a posture guide, although I reference it often after a class when I have some new success or difficulty with a posture.

Definitely worth the money and goes a long way to help deepen your understanding of your Bikram yoga practice.
