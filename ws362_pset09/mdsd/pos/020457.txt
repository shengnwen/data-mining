I loved the illustrations in the book and how mama bear was trying to show her family there is more to life than television. BUT when I read this book I couldn't really relate cause I was addicted to tv and it was hard not to be when it was always on. You can tell the book came out in the 80's too since there is no internet and brother bear is playing with a rubik's cube.
