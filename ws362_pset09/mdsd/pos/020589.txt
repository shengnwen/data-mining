I was introduced to this book by a friend while staying at their vacation home on Lake Champlain in Vermont.  It had rained most of the stay and I had exhausted my own supply of books and was wandering through their dusty library shelves when the dame of the home entered and knowing that I am an avid reader, recommended this book.  She is a woman in her 70's and said that to this day she reads the book about once a year.  I was instantly smitten and spent the next day and a half reading constantly, much to the chagrine of my husband who could not believe that I took the book in the tub, on the boat, to bed, and to a hidden spot in the servant's quarters in the attic to finally finish the text.

The writing is easy and eloquent.  The story is funny and simple.  I love how Ms. Fisher gives us the ability to see what's going on in Betsy's mind and the haughty-taughty little gal is a hoot!  I found myself wishing I was 12 and had just read the book.  I know I would put on the character and emulate the old-fashioned principles idealized in this quaint story
