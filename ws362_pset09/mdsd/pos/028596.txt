A Woman of Substance is a book that I have wanted to read for many years but held off mainly because of the number of pages. With the help of a few reading friends, I was finally able to conquer this saga and am now happy that I did.
AWOS tell the story of Emma Harte. A young girl who came from poverty only to become one of the most powerful and richest woman in the world. 
When Emma was just a child she worked for the Fairleys as a servant. The masters son, Edwin, and her became very close friends and eventually started a relationship that only led to trouble. Scorned and let down by Edwin, Emma ran off to find her fortune and vowed revenge of the Fairleys.
As we go through the years with Emma, we experience her love and loss but one thing always stayed true, her secret to life. 
"You must endure."
Find yourself a nice comfortable place to read this great book and enjoy your time with Emma. You certainly will not regret it, or forget her.
