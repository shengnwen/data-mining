This may well be Philip K Dick's best.  When one of his competitors top telepaths disappears off the face of the Earth, Glen Runciter, who runs an anti PSI firm, goes to consult with his deceased wife.  Recently deceased Loved Ones can be placed in a moratorium, where they enter into half life.  There they can be resurrected briefly for communing only.  Runciter and eleven of his staff are commisioned to travel to Luna for a secret project.  It turns out to be a trap, and Runciter is killed.  Joe Chip, a top techie of the firm takes charge.  At this point reality becomes obscured and it is difficult to know whether Runciter is dead, alive, or in half life, the same goes for his eleven member team.  UBIK is a miracle product, a force for good.  Then there's Pat, one of the eleven, who can change the future by altering the past.  Lastly there's Jory a half lifer with terrible powers over other half lifers
