I had to read this book for a college class in Cultural Anthropology a few years ago.  I must say that it was a really fascinating read, if not the most well laid out detective novel.  Things do look random from one perspective, as Leaphorn said he used to think, just like the paint on the rocks looked random until seen from the right perspective (another Navajo principle of metaphysics).  This book is loaded with Navajo metaphysics and cultural insights.  I think the story of Ashie Pinto's alcoholism is quite sad, actually, and I don't entirely understand the concept of the coyote in Navajo culture, but this is still a great read.  I wouldn't at all pass it up
