This book sits quite well alongside Steinbecks "Grapes of Wrath"...similar tales of trials and tribulations. Although I would say that Buck's prose is slightly simpler. Very good story and very well told. My enjoyment of it might have been heightened as I recently returned from China and so was able to picture the scenes/characters much more readily. A quick read and flows well. Recommended.
