  	There are many books explaining the places where the value PHI and the Golden Ratio show up.  One discovers that maybe the ancient Greeks based their architecture upon it, and the value was one of the mysteries of the Pythagoreans.  Some authors explain this golden ratio to the dimensions of the pyramids.  Some books contain the view that the architecture of all life contains an undercurrent of the value of PHI.  I have read many books about this subject and this is the book to read. It runs the whole gamut, history, architecture, art-history, and mathematics. The author, Mario Livio, cites many others books and studies, often critically showing that not all artists that knew of the golden ratio used it in their art and that any monument's dimensions when forced through enough mathematical gyrations will portray whatever is desired.  The illustrations within the book are superb, right to the point and easy to understand.  The author explains a difficult concept  in an easy to read manner, even though it involves Fibonacci sequences and fractals.  The author is Head of the Space Telescope Science Institute , he knows the subject of which he writes and more importantly can relate this knowledge to the reader.  Kudos to the author, well done
