I have recently read the excellent book "Fiasco," about the war in Iraq.
It did not make me feel good about the war at all.

I decided to read "Imperial Life in the Emerald City" to learn how another writer viewed the war. It does not ease the pain.

The American invasion and occupation of Iraq has been a disaster. The military did its part, but the people running the country failed miserably. 

I had read that there was no real planning. Instead, the country was mismanaged by a bunch of hacks--starting with Bremer---who did not have a clue as to what they could, or should, do.

The biggest failure has to be Bremer. On paper, he appeared to be well-qualified to run the occupation. He certainly did not want for effort, work, and determination. 

Bremer, however, had more money than common sense, more power than the abilty to use it. He put the former Iraqi military out of work, instantly generated thousands of insurgents. No-one could tell him what he did not want to hear. 

The occupation failed to provide water, electricity, and security. Police cars were stolen, and used as taxis. Former thugs ran bogus police forces which existed to loot and pillage. There were not nearly enough U.S. soldiers to deal with the problems. 

And, worst of all, those running the show lived in the "Emerald City," the walled enclosure, which kept them totally disconnected with the world outside. Everything they had was flown in from Kuwait--food, consumer goods, bottled water. The world outside the wall meant nothing to the number crunchers, idealists, political hacks, and self-serving half-wits.

Bush blew it. There is no other way to look at it. No thought went into the occupation, no good thinking came from the "Emerald City," or Washington D.C. Both places exist to keep the policy makers free of all the constraints of the real world. And the results are obvious. 

This is a good book
