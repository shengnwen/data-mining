The theme in this book is really cool. It inspires people to help others and care more for themselves. It has some really cool action scenes like in the movie except it's better than the movie. After I read the book it has made me like Spiderman even more than ever. It has helped me understand that others are more important than you. It also teaches that people should really be careful in the things that they do to others and themselves. People should put their talents into good use instead of doing bad and selfish things. People should read this book because it teaches people to care more for others and to take more responsibility in their actions. The author, Peter David, deserves some real awards because he has made a really amazing effort to make this book
