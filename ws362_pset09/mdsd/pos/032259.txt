This book helps to retrain / reprogram how we think about economics to our personal benefit.  Anyone who has studied traditional economics knows the faults of the theories....one's that were made hundreds of years ago.  Over the past century, our knowledge of the economy and what drives it has become much clearer and this book, along with Harry's observations drives home these important understandings.  Once a person understands that 2/3rds of our economy is driven by consumers and that those people are highly predictable....that knowledge came be extremely powerful.  Go back and read Harry's past work and you will quickly find that his long term predictions of the economy in the past....during times which people highly discounted his work....hit one by one, almost like clock work.
