This book is my favorite cookbook for desserts.  It has the most amazing recipes.  I've tried several of the recipes from this book, and they have all been extraordinarily good.  If you want to make amazing chocolate recipes that make people say &quot;Wow,&quot; get this book.  It also has a lot of helpful information to make it easy to get the recipes done right
