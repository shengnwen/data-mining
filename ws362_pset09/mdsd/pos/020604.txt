Story Time is about two kids named George and Kate. George is a genius and Kate ... well isn't. One day George an Kate get invited to the Whittaker Magnet School which boasts the highest test scores in the U.S. The school is a dreary place where kids take tests all day long and never have any fun. The school turns out to have a terrible secret of demonds and murder. George and Kate must end the demond's murdurous ways and at the same time bring the school to justice.
