Successful companies need to excel at something. A great deal of their time and focus is (and should be) spent on improving their ability to compete on whatever it is that makes them excel, whether it is innovative products, superior distribution, better service, etc. As the book points out, this also becomes an Achilles heal. The book the Medici Effect points out that innovation comes from combining disparate ideas and fields. The more that firms commit to 'sustaining innovation' the harder it is to see what's next, and even if seen, embrace it. 

Innovation isn't always kind to current business models or market leaders, especially since many innovations start from the low end of the spectrum (think self service, lower prices, stripped down basic functionality.) The book really stresses the importance of flexibility and vision in the corporate setting. This is kind of a corner office theory, so unless you are a CEO, the book is more about spotting mistakes
