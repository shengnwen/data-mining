Finding Noel grabbed my attention from the very first chapter.  As a devoted Evans reader, I found this book one of his best, matching it closely with his first, A Christmas Box.

Evans knows how to involve the reader in his stories, and his methods of making the reader feel true emotion is outstanding.

I became so wrapped up in the story, I had to finish it in one sitting.  You cannot put the book down once you start it...a rare quality for novels of this type.

If you have never a novel by Rick Evans, this book would be a great place to start.  Once you begin, you will want to read his others.

So there is no question about my commentary, I am a friend of Rick Evans; I know Rick Evans; and this book is one of his best!
