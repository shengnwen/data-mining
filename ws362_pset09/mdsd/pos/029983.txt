Although this is a very interesting and useful book, almost of all entries are so-called &quot;the westerners&quot; with a few exceptions ; e.g. Mishima Yukio. And I don't understand the reason why the editors included &quot;Anita Bryant&quot; in the book. I think she is suitable to be listed in &quot;Who's Who in Contemporary Homophobic-syndrome patients&quot;. Or the editors meant she also is a kind of &quot;self-abhorrent homosexual&quot; like Sanctus Paulus et Sanctus Augustinus ? I'd like to know the reason, if they don't mind
