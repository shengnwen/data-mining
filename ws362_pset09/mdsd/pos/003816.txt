I started this book during a performance between my solos.  I was immediately struck by the strength of invention required to create the protagonist "professor dr." von Igelfeld.  The stories are funny and interesting (although the presidency of Columbia seems a bit contrived) but the character was so clear and real that I bought the rest of the series just to see what he does.  Also, McCall Smith has a talent for representing the idiosyncratic thought/speech patterns of the various cultures represented, and that alone is hilarious.  You have to be smart to like this book, and I just barely made it, but I made it.
