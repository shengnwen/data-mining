Creating Writers got me charged up and well-prepared for teaching sriting/revision using the 6 Trait model.  Spandel writes well, using a combination of research-based information and personal anecdotes to keep the reader's attention.  I appreciate the number and variety of samples she included for practice revision/assessment.  The samples were, however, not very easy to duplicate for classroom use.  The print is too small and there are often two samples on one page, or one sample on several pages.  The layout is difficult to work with.  Overall, though, the book is excellent.  I have been to two training sessions about 6 Traits, but it took Spandel's book to get me hooked and enthusiastic, and  made me confident about using the 6 Traits in the classroom.The information deserves a 5 star rating.  The format deserves a 2
