I had never read anything by this author, but I was anxious to study about how Christianity got to where we are today. I just finished another book "The Domestication Of Transendence:How Modern Thinking About God Went Wrong" by William Placher who dealt with late medival and 17th century writings. So I needed to start further back to have a good foundation for knowledge of Christian thought.

What I discovered in Wilken's book was a well-ordered, easy-to-read narration of much more than a historical account. He explores what is behind the ideas and the doctrines of the time period from the ressurection to the 7th century.

This book was very enlightening and I look forward to further readings on this subject
