This is a thoroughly readable text starting with the discovery of oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania and ending with the Iranian revolution. I ponder what insight Yergin would bring to a follow-up book but he is secure resting on his laurels. This book is a must-read for anyone wishing to understand the power-struggles in the oil industry. As for shortages, Yergin suggests that there have been several. Once oil became scarce in Pennsylvania, which supplied kerosene for lamps throughout the world, new discoveries followed in turn-in Indonesia, in east Texas, Russia, Iraq, Iran, and the Arabian peninsula. It is small wonder that as the thirst for oil grew, we, in the modern world, became accustomed to new finds. Beyond the new discoveries, Yergin explains how Standard Oil of Indiana saved the day by developing, in the early 1900s, a new process for cracking oil to produce gasoline efficiently. Without this invention, the internal combustion engine would have stalled on the market-long before Henry Ford could dismiss his customer's complaint about the model T by saying, "They can have any color they want, as long as it's black." This is also a story about interesting characters. The descriptions of Rockefeller, Getty and the founders of Shell and British Petroleum were very entertaining. But, I am forgetting the undertone in Yergin's book. I enjoyed the tales of how the thirst for oil affected the strategies of the warring parties during World War II. And, how political intrigue between the great powers (England, the US, and others), and the indigenous people, who owned the oil, worked to shape our modern world.
