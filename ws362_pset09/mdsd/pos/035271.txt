While the paperback of The People's Act of Love is covered in quotes comparing it to Doctor Zhivago and Anna Karenina, the reader would be better off without such grand expectations.  As a page turner, it's a first class thriller.  As a work of literature, it's sly, reserved tone can't cover the outright sensationalism and melodrama that the author serves up.  It's a book about lives weaving closer together in the Siberian hinterland and while these lives are fairly convincing while told separately, once the characters begin to intertwine, they seems to lose their individuality and move only as chess pieces.  This is probably because Meek seeks to wrap up his book in a grand finale, with terrible characters claiming grand acts of redemption against a background of revolution and blood.  Perhaps he gave himself a bit too much to chew on, and the last quarter gets weighed down by exposition as Meek tries to tie up his ends.  Still, great fun getting there, but please leave the comparisons to Tolstoy behind.
