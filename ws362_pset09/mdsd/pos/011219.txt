This book offers a survey of Fundamentalist politics from the perspective of the fundamentalist leader Jerry Falwell. Harding weaves together historical analysis with anthropological commentary whilst also letting the subjects speak for themselves through the inclusion of lengthy quotes from fundamentalist preachers. 

One of Harding's main comments is on the often misunderstood rehetorics of fundamentalist political language and she explains how they what fundamentalists hear when Falwell speaks is often different to how other hear the same words. The book is divided into chapters (obviously!) with each dealing with a different topic (eg abortion, creationism etc). The strength of this book is that it gives a context through fundamentalist history of contemporary positions. The end result is a very readable fairminded glimpse into the different world that is christian fundamentalist politcs and one that is recommended for those interested in the subject. 

My one major criticism is that their is often a lack of theological grasp of some of the issues involved which of course you cannot particularly blame Harding for (she is an anthropologist). This is a book that would have benefitted from a co-author (Mark Noll immediately springs to mind).

Overall though this is definitely recommended.
