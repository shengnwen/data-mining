I may be biased because the author provided a signed copy of this book to my library (I'm a college library director), but the photography in this is nothing less than stunningly beautiful.  There are photos here of commonly seen animals shot in uncommon ways, and photos of other creatures that look more at home in a John Carpenter film than an ocen on Earth.  You can tell by the nature of the work Curtsinger has insinuated himself in some scary places (a photo of another diver deep in an underwater ice crevasse, for instance, makes you wonder at Curtsinger's own position for shooting it), but his courage allows us to marvel at sights most of us couldn't even imagine.  I recommend this as a coffee table book for people to actually look at, and as a great addition to nature or photgraphy collections.  Truly remarkable
