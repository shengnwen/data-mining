This is the second week I am on the Atkins and right now I would not trade it for any other diet. I am losing the weight slowly but I need to exercise more and I need to control this darn "sweet tooth", for chocolate which is a no-no. Dr. Atkins give helpful tips on what you should do. I have not done the induction at all though, maybe if I had the money and the time to cook all those things :0
