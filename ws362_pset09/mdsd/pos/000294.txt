KR's book is way better than the legal thriller genre might make you think.  Its more like Umberto Eco than Dan Brown, and more like John Franzen than John Grisham.   You learn alot, even if you were already a lawyer or a law clerk yourself.

Kim's book, to paraphase what someone once said about Marilyn Monroe, has curves in places that others don't even have places.   Yes, you may have to use your brain when reading this, but fear not KR will take care of you.

Tell me what other book can make a plot issue out of asset securitization?  Or explore what it feels like to win a case, but feel sick about the judicial reasoning?  That's the kind stuff you have to have a kind of hyper-legal sensitivity to write about.  That's K.R.

Finally, the book contains the great idea of putting metal taps on your shoes which does indeed protect them
