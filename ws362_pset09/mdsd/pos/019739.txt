With my goal of establishing healthy eating habits for my family (mainly centered on my children ages 10, 9 and 9), I stumbled upon this incrediable book dealing with getting kids healthy. This book titled Trim Kids : The Proven 12-Week Plan That Has Helped Thousands of Children Achieve a Healthier Weight, by Melinda S. Sothern, and T. Kristian von Almen is extraordinary. 

Trim Kids teaches kids how to be healthy in a concise and easy to follow, step by step program. It begins by determining what reality really is when determining proper weight, body mass and exercise for each child. The book goes on to teach the children (and parents) what proper fat and sugar intake really is. There are many questionnaires to follow in determining what area your children are doing well in and what areas can be improved upon. This gave my children a great participatory method of determining just how healthy they were or were not.

After several chapters on how to establish what really is healthy, the book gives many clear and exciting tips on finding proper exercise and eating environments to begin the road of creating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle the kids can enjoy and keep for a lifetime. Our personal favorite suggestion is the winter exercise room complete with a mattress, hula-hoops, jump ropes, a mini trampoline and loud music!

Once the foundation has been laid, the book takes you on a 12-week step by step program to help the kids (and the adults) see what progress they are making with the program. Each week has new recipes and exercise suggestions to keep the kids motivated. The program is simple and very easy to follow. My whole family is committed to this program. My children and I read a chapter each night before bedtime and we are all healthier because of it. This is NOT a diet book. It is however a great book on establishing a healthy lifestyle that all of us can easily follow.
