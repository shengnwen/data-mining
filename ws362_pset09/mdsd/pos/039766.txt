Great reference about Photoshop to who does not want to waste time consulting bibles and cold references about the tool. That book does not board the effects creation. The author makes a point of clarify itself that in the introduction. 
The book care for colors management, tones and colors adjustment, correction and cutting masks, optimization of digital photos, images preparation for the Web, in other words, all that is necessary for the conclusion and treatment of digital images. 
I liked a lot of the environment preparation chapters of working with Photoshop, so much in the MAC as in the PC, and also of the introduction on the management of digital colors. 
Indispensable book for art-finalists and producers of digital images
