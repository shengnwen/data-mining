Some of the other reviews say that the concept of principle centered leadership is old or rehashed, or that people who don't know this shouldn't be in business.

Yet it's still incredibly hard to find corporations that operate on leading by principle.  The vast majority of companies still hire people to do a specific job and if the workers become more efficient, they're marginally rewarded. "Do this over and over again, and we'll give you some money."

The concept of utilizing the actual mind's of employees is brilliant. Creativity is an infinite untapped resource.  Consider the fact that we only use 10% of our brains.  Imagine what would happen if we started tapping into that remaining 90%.  Imagine what would happen to a company if it tapped into the massive creative conscious of its many employees.

People can't be treated like machines that need to be more efficient. People are not machines, they are people.

Stimulate their minds and get them to contribute to the direction of the company and (surprise,surprise) they will feel like they matter.  This will bring forward motivation, enthusiasm and responsibility AS WELL AS fresh ideas, innovative solutions and ultimately, rampant growth.

All the company needs is a worthy principle to guide the people.  Here's a good example: "Serve the customer like they've never been served before." The company that succeeds understands that there's always a better way to do something, and after achieveing the better way, there's an even better way.

In order to find these better ways, the successful company realizes that their workers can contribute very useful ideas by being actively involved in the direction of the company.

Principle centered leadership is not an old concept.  It is a necessary concept that unfortunately only a minority of businesses use.
