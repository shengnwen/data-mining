I had heard about Carnitine at the gym.  Others were taking it inorder to bulk up their muscle mass.  I ordered Crayhon's book and readit cover to cover.  I care less about muscle mass and more aboutdropping the pounds that have piled on.  His book explains thatCarnitine's function is to burn that fat.  The plus side is that theheart becomes healthy both through the action of the Carnitine andthrought the increased overall health of the body.  My work-outsbecame more productive....I am well on my way to a healthy heart and atrimmer body due to these and...other supplements..
