I expected this to be arty rubbish, but I was greatly surprised.  It's a unique and strangely beautiful experience -- and not only that, but the picture-per-page structure makes it ideal to dip into during spare moments.   Whether it actually has any deep meaning is open to debate, but each page  has something on it to provoke thought.  I love this thing
