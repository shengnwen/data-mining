This fictional novel is truly inspiring from start to finish. Author Daniel Keyes builds the main character, a mentally slow adult named Charlie Gordon, as a warm and innocent person. 
Charlie's doctor consults him regarding the possibility of a surgery to improve his intelligence. He's instructed to write in a journal so as to document his improvement, if any. Thus, this novel is written as if it were Charlie's diary. Charlie undergoes the same surgery as an experimental lab mouse named Algernon, as this surgery had a very successful effect on Algernon. Slowly, his operation proves to have the same effect on him. He becomes extremely intelligent; first, his grammar and spelling are significantly improved in his diary entries. Progressively, his thoughts become deeper and eventually, his intellectual abilities are more advanced than even the doctors around him. He develops an "intelligence that can't really be calculated." But it isn't all smooth sailing for Charlie. He's suddenly engulfed in strange feelings and situations unfamiliar to him, from remembering traumatizing events of his childhood, to feeling love and lust. He even begins to wonder about those who he considered close to him, seeing their "'phoniness and shallowness.'" It's a heart-wrenching and confusing roller coaster all the while. 
When Algernon's improvements begin to fail and his intelligence is fading, what will happen to Charlie? This poignant story will keep you interested and you'll feel the emotions coming from Keyes' touching words.
