I have every baby-sitters book and i'm not exageratting! These books are great, they teach you life lessons as well as little lessons! even though they are for 8-10 yr. olds im 12 and i read them often. they remind me of home because im an exchange student from the USA and im in mexico. you definetly should read them. ADIOS AMIGOS ME GUSTA MUCHO BSC LIBROS! :
