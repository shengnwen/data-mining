I am a simple man, and require little to be happy.  I thrive on the opportunity to improve myself, my relationships with others and learn how I can communicate better, more clearly and leave this world just a little better than it was before I was here.

This book, Flipping the Switch is all about knowing that I am responsible to make decisions.  Ones that I can live with, and add value to others lives with these decisions.  I KNOW that there are those who might think it nonsense or rhetoric, and I am sorry they cannot see genuine feeling for what it is.

Every chapter in this short book is filled with timeless principles of stunning simplicity which if implemented in one's life could be a superb spring board to the next great leader of this or any country, or even a club.  

One of my favorite stories is about his dad showing that service is what counts in this life.  Doing what others need and going beyond what they need because you genuinely care is rare in this 'only what's needed' culture (US).  Interpersonal relationships don't work on an economic scale, so they do not mesh with dollars and cents, but always mesh with common sense.  

If you want to know some things that you need to know on how to really succeed beyond the job, beyond the gym, beyond the marriage, and in EVERY relationship, including the one with your self image, this one short book will be one of the keys!  Get it and read it.  Live it.
