This book is a passionate response to attacks on Pope Pius XII; it's interesting that some reviewers have tried to downplay the book by misrepresenting it. One self-important reviewer wrote this: "By the way, just who is Regency Publishing anyway? ... As someone who has written and taught about Fascist Italy and the Holocaust, I smell a rat!" If that reviewer had been paying attention, he might have noticed that the book is published by Regnery, not Regency. It's a conservative publisher, maybe not one of the most famous companies, but perfectly reputable. In any case, this book is not ideal, but it pulls together some useful information that can help in the search for a more balanced picture of Pius XII
