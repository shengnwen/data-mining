For anyone who loves drum sets, this is a fabulous book. The pictures are wonderful, and the history of the trap set is really fascinating. If you want a lot about jazz sets or jazz drummers, this isn't the book for you, but still, the history of drums from the 1920's on is good to read. The appendix, a listing of many, many drum companies, is enlightening and useful. Soon it may be updated, and that'll be great, too (2003 is a long way from 1997 in some ways!
