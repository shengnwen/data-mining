From the title and the general appearance of this book I was tempted to blow it off as some king of new age psycho babble. Then the book fell open to a section on the dot.coms. He talks here about the suspension of the old mental models that too many people had. 

I was in the internet business before the dot.coms really got started. I was dumb enough to understand that this was just another form of communications for mail order or direct marketing as it likes to be known now. I was too dumb to realize that I should have been in the money raising business instead of the mail order business and may I would have come out of it with at least a yacht. 

His overall discussion of the dot.coms was, for me at least, very insightful. His conclusion regarding engaging in experiments, examing the disconnects between the old and new models, consider the infrastructure (mail order dog food as one company tried, couldn't stand the shipping costs), trust your intuition - but gain the experience to change it. 

This was enough to tell me to read the book. It's not psycho babble. We all have mindsets of how we've done things. And as we approach the future some of them have to change: outsourcing, rising cost of energy, increased hurricanes from global warming (don't live in New Orleans, even if they rebuild it, it will happen again), rising cost of energy, terrorism. 

There are a lot of books that  try to predict the future. They are all partly right, partly wrong. The mindset with which you approach the future is the critical thing to your success
