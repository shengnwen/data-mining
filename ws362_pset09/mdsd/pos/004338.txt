I love the straight to the point approach in this book. I have read tons of books on manifestation and this one puts all the concepts together in an excellent manner. I love re-reading it and applying certain parts of it. I have been getting money but do not know whether I should attribute it to my spiritual work. It seems like it just comes through regular channels. May be I just notice it more now. I will only be convinced if I make an extraordinarily large sum of money for myself. It seems, though, as if things are getting there.
