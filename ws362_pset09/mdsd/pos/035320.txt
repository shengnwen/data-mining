I just finished Targets of Opportunity, my fourth Joe Weber novel.  This author never ceases to amaze me.  His writing style is terrific.  The plot of this book was great, the action scenes are very descriptive and I really enjoy the characters.  They are very real and the emotions and reactions they show are never &quot;the usual&quot;.  As with his other books - you are quickly placed right into the thick of things and never get a chance to leave.  I never liked books where the first few chapters are written to introduce and develop the characters and settings - and neither does Joe Weber, obviously.  Get the reader sucked into the action and the characters will develop as we go along.  Another wonderful reading experience
