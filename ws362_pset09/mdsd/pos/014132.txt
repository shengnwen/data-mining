I won't go into the story line - it's been recounted by the other reviewers above. However, I will say this: I am a HUGH fan of JM! I was  hunting for other books by her that I have not yet read & came across this one. I could not put this book down! It was one of the most beautiful & compelling romances I have ever read. It blows me away that some of the reviewers have negative feedback on it. I loved Mitchell & Kate! What a couple! Add in little Daniel (22 months old), some familiar characters  (Benedicts & Farrells), and all the new 'faces', a tropical paradise, and the international flavour of Mitchell's life & of course, Billy the sociopath - and what a great story you have! When Mitchell meets his son Daniel for the first time after he is rescued from the kidnapper, Daniel, a miniature carbon copy of his dad, and Mitchell, seeing the son that he never knew he had, they looked at each other in awe and wonder! I re-read that part over and over again! Beautiful book with a beautiful ending. It makes you cry and laugh and feel so good afterwards! It's sexy, with plenty of drama and suspense, what with the deaths of both Edward & William, and suspicion falling on Mitchell (the 'outsider' Wyatt) - the man who was 'given away' as a baby, and who grew up thinking that he was nobody's baby - which just made him try all the harder to excel in all things, which he does & emerges as a brilliant successful tycoon! PLEASE give this book a try. HINT: Get the copy printed in 2006 (there is a little pink circular mark in the lower right of the cover page, It contains some extra scenes that just may be the icing on the cake). This book is going on my 'keeper' shelf!
