This is quite possibly the most thorough, critical investigation of the figure of David ever done, and comes to the same conclusion regarding the extent of David's territory that I had arrived at based on what I've read of the archaeological material- roughly, that David ruled "from Dan to Beersheba," and no more than that.  Typical reconstructions that give David and Solomon control up to the Euphrates, or even to the southern border of Hamath, base their borders on later 7th century Judean traditions and not on the relatively early material preserved in the books of Samuel.  Halpern uses linguistic, epigraphic, and other elements to separate early material from late, and shows that the earliest material does not give David territory touching Damascus, let alone the Euphrates.

Unfortunately, this otherwise excellent study is marred by a few dubious assumptions- first and foremost is Halpern's separation of 1 Samuel into A and B sources.  Unlike the Penateuchal sources sources JEPD, which are pretty much universally agreed upon, the division of 1 Samuel into "A" and "B" sources is only one of several explanations that have been offered to explain the doublets and contradictions, and he makes no attempt to explain why he believes this model is better than, say, McCarter's model of a continuous base narrative supplemented by several independent stories which contain some duplicates of the larger narrative.  Another dubious assumption- and this really harms the book- is the starting assumption that every piece of early material in the David-Saul narrative, including the main redactive framework, is an apologia dating from Solomon's reign (except the A source, which he dates a bit later).  While some of the stories certainly originally stem from propaganda seeking to exonerate David, and the Court History is concievably from Solomon's reign, the Saul-David cycles clearly contain an amount of folklore in the narrative; for  the deed of slaying Goliath, originally attributed to David's subordinate Elhanan, to be transferred by storytellers to David himself, would take some time, and would probably not have been completed during Solomon's reign.  Perhaps a little later, c. 900 BC, is a better candidate for the Saul-David cycles
