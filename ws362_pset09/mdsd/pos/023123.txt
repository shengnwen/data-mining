This is a book that sweeps you off your feet from the first page.  Lorelei Fellows is a strong willed, defiant, stubborn woman and Holt McKettrick happens to have very similar qualities.  The hero and heroine are a perfect match for one another and because there is so much tension between them, it makes those softer moments even more tender.

The story in itself is very interesting from cattle drive to the Comanches attacks to the way women live on the trail.  All the characters are intriguing and very likeable (except for the bad guys, of course!).

It's a great story to read all on its own.  Happy Reading
