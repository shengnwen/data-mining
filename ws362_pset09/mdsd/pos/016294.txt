As before, "The Waste Lands" has a direct connection to "Drawing of the three", exactly like it was the case between part I and II in the DT series. Here you have a simply PERFECT King novel, especially related to the DT series: The playground keeps changing on and on all through the plot, the same with the Tet; one person joins them probably every single reader would've expected at he very last to arrive again, and a non - human being's also supposed to join Roland on his further way to the tower, I dare to say until the last episode of the series...

Yeah, as I said above, here we have a simply FANTASTIC novel where I hardly found any difficulties to follow the story. The book's a bit longer than the parts before, due to its MASS of action and change of playground, of course, but here I can't even complain about this in ANY WAY!!!
