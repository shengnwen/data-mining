There are some books you read as a child that will always hold a precious place in your memory, as journeys that took your soul to places it had never been before. And if the book is especially precious, you come back to it again and again over the decades, and it has new things to teach you each time, that as your soul grows through age and wisdom you are better equipped to understand.

Such a book is A Wrinkle in Time, the 1963 Newberry Award Winner by Madeline L'Engle. For those who have never read it, the novel follows Meg, a young misfit adolescent as she is suddenly catapulted across the galaxy to rescue her father. Along the way, she discovers lessons about love, loyalty, courage, and the nature of fighting against evil. As in the worlds of Tolkien and Lewis, the world is magical but the characters and their situations reflect Biblical reality and ethics. The lessons taught through the medium of fiction thus are not "preachy" but still powerful, ones that are still worth pondering for me. Well worth reading, again and again
