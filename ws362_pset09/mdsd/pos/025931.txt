Martin Espada is one of the most important poets of his generation.  His work forces, and allows, his listener to understand the life experiences of the many people who don't find their lives in our literature often enough.  He achieves this with warmth, humor, rage, and a love for his subject. One listen to this wonderful collection and you will understand why Espada is among the most popular poets on the reading circuit.  The only thing better than this CD is to see Espada live.

Any lover of poetry out loud needs this CD in his or her collection.
