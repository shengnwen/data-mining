I'm sure there's no substitute for reading the scriptures in the original languages (ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek) but being ignorant of all but English, I was looking for the most literal translation I could find.

I have no doubt about the scholarship or accuracy of the JPS translation, but I was left somehow unsatisfied. The text reads like a Basic English translation with a 1000 word vocabulary. An unabridged English dictionary has probably 500,000 words. Couldn't the translators have found some equally accurate but more colorful words for their phrasing. Perhaps I've been spoiled by elaborate Elizabethan phrases of the KJV.

The notes are almost exclusively concerned with questions of translation. It would have been nice to have some sort of scriptural cross reference, or index, or concordance. In this day of computerized type setting, etc. it cannot be that hard or costly.

I was also disappointed by the physical quality of a book that is going to referenced many times. The cover is insubstantial, there are no end papers, and the pages are glued rather than being sewn in signatures - a disposible Bible.
