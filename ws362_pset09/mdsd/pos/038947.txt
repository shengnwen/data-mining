I think this is hands-down my favorite book.  In intellectual conversation I'll always say Michael Creighton is my favorite author but this book has such a special place in my heart.  It's not any sort of epic novel but it's not meant to be.  It's the true story of a man reflecting on his boyhood with his dog.  The story is funny, endearing, and most of all - real.  This is a must-read if you are a dog lover
