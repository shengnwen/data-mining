Dr. Reed Richards is sure he has found a scientific breakthrough.  All he has to do is convince billionaire (and nemesis) Victor Van Doom, to help him reach a cosmic storm in order to observe it.  While Victor agrees to the use of his private space station, the price is almost all profit made from this research.  On the space station, Reed and the rest of his team: best friend, Ben Grimm; ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm; her hotshot brother, Johnny Storm; as well as Doom himself, are shocked when something goes amiss and everyone is exposed to the cosmic storm.

Back on Earth, they discover that the cloud has altered their DNA, giving each a type of super power.  Reed, Susan, Ben, and Johnny band together in an effort to analyze what has happened to them and find a way to reverse the effects.  Mr. Fantastic: Reed has the ability to stretch and contort his body.  The Invisible Woman: Susan can make herself invisible and create an energy shield.  The Human Torch: Johnny is able to go up in flames- literally- and fly.  The Thing: Ben is now rock-hard and has superhuman strength.  Unfortunately, Van Doom has also been given powers, and unlike the others, decided to use them for evil.  Now he is bent on revenge for the loss of power the cosmic storm fiasco caused and will do anything to destroy Reed and the rest of the `Fantastic Four'. 

While the Fantastic Four novelization was not up to the same level as others have been, it was still a good read.  There were a couple discrepancies between the book and movie, which was a little annoying.  The storyline itself focused on how the FF got their powers and why they became a team more than anything else.  The book makes the characters seem a little more real, which I liked.
