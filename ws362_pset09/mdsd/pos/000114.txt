There are some good reviews on this page.I recommend that you read them.And because there are good ones,I would not write too many words in this review concerning the respective book.
I simply want to let you know that it is a great book.Well developed and extremely fascinating.
Now that Roland has begun to form his group(from the previous book),we begin to learn more of the history of his world and of how all the worlds fit together.The grourp begins to travel..and yet Roland is having problems,and is slowly losing his mind.(this is hinted in the previous book also)
He completes his group,and they travel on...and they find a city from the past,haunted by the ghosts of technology and the superstition on the inhabitants.
After making it through,we see the real WASTE LANDS,so much more terrible that the wide desert Roland crossed at the beginning of the King's tale.

The book is quite well written,and very consistent...we see the wheel of ka turning through everyone's life,drawing them together.Quite a few things you learn here become important later on...and for fans of his other books,we even see and old Friend!...enjoy...Nigel
