With a wide range of woodworkers who have an even wider range of budgets, interests, and shop space it is no doubt very hard to write a book such as this that will have mass appeal.  I congratulate Mr. Proulx on succeeding wonderfully in this task.  For those professionals out there with lots of shop space, there are loads of great ideas for built in storage cabinets and home crafted tool aids (such as a large router table and table saw outfeed table/storage cabinet).  As a home woodworker with a small-ish shop and a fair amount of tools, I appreciated the many projects in this book dedicated to housing and efficiently using benchtop power tools.  

Every woodworker I know will appreciate the fact that these  projects include a complete materials list (with measurements given in both English and metric), clear instructions on how to construct the piece, and that the author always seems to be building as if he were on a budget (which most of us readers are).

Overall I am well pleased with this book and I highly recommend it!
