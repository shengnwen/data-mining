Editor Levy provides a good array of texts, starting with the Heidelberger professor Eisenmenger in 1710 and ending with some fellow named Yevgeny Yevseev, who published an "Anti-Zionist" screed in 1971, harmonized with the "anti-fascist" rhetoric current in the then Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. In between are selections from Voltaire, Wagner, Stoecker, von Treitschke, Marr, various committee works, the Protocolls, Henry Ford, a trio of drosches by Hitler(yemakh shmo), the statement of the Wahnsee Conference, as it was called, and a few other bits here and there.
Levy has added introductions to each historical section, along with a good "additional reading" selection. The entirety is prefaced by an attempt at a definition of "Anti-Semitism"; his attempt seems as good as any that doesn't resort to metaphysics. My only suggestion would have been to add a few more American selections; some of the urban rustics associated with Louis Farrakhan are mentioned in ancillary material but I think it would have been useful to add full examples of some of anti-Jewish rubbish that here and now rolls around burning in the American street, stinking and befouling the feckless rhetoricians who refuse to recognize it for what it is.
