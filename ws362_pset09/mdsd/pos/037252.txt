I have not seen the other Flash Bible Books so therefore gave it a 4 star rating. Also i am a tad dissapointed, the book itself has a lot of info (which the first few chapters is basic stuff) but it also seems that this may be the same content as the other Flash Bible books. It does go over some of the new Flash 8 features like the filters, however i was hoping the book would contain the new "BitmapData" and bitmap caching but it did not. Also maybe go over the timeline effects even if it is simple to understand. Had these features been included it would have been 5 stars
