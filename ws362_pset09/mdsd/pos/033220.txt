If you're a Christian involved in the arts, you MUST read this.
Even though the book was written back in 1981, Franky's comments about contemporary evangelicalism indulging themselves in propagandizing, sloganeering bad art with the label "Christian" slapped on it is more relevant that ever.

Franky attacks the false notion that if you're a Christian and you are an artist that any art you do MUST have an overt, and obvious "Christian" theme to it. Creativity in and of itself is Godly, and good and Evangelicals need not slap a cheap propagandizing slogan on it to justify it.

Likewise, Franky tears down the false assumption that some actions in the Christian life are "spiritual," (ie . reading your Bible and praying) while others are "non-spiritual" (ie playing with your kids.) All of the Christian life is spiritual.

I can't recommend this book enough
