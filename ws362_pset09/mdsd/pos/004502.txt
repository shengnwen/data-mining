this was a great book. this was a story of a young girl and her alcoholic but loving father and strickt but loving mother and there messy divorce. it takes place in oregon around the great depression time, and it also goes through this girls struggle with puberty and awkwardness of addolessence. the abuse of her father, moms boss, and her uncle, and the finding that her best friend can be her boyfriend.this is a wonderful book the only reason i gave it four stars is because it had a utterly dissapointing ending. its ending was like the author lost interest or ran out of ideas and left it at that.but dont let the ending keep you from not reading the book it is still a great book
