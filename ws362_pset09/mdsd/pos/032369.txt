After reading the many reviews I purchased the book.  I found it worth the money I spent as it reviewed most topics with Matting, Mounting and somewhat a little short on the framing.  Would have given five stars if the discussion on making the framing was a little more discussed.

I did purchase the Logan CD on making your own picture frames, promptly returned it as there was more in the book on making picture frames.
