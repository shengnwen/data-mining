I had looked through some gemology books in the past, but found them too scientific and intimidating.  This book is very readable and informative.  The reader will understand how three inexpensive tools can be used to evaluate the majority of gems.  The book also describes how the reader can go about getting more information and further expanding their knowledge.  This is a book well worth having for anyone wishing to learn about gemology.
