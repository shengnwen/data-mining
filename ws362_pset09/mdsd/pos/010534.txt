This intense and masterfully written novel by Zoe Heller introduces one of the most captivating and intriguing characters of the decade as it tells its sordid and juicy tale of illicit love and the scandal that ensues.

Barbara Covett is a single and painfully lonely teacher in her 60s, who has very few friends and prefers to keep mostly to herself. When the lower-class school that she works at welcomes Sheba Hart; a carefree, attractive and popular new art teacher; Barbara senses that a friendship will develop between them, although she quickly becomes skeptical of that occuring. However, as their association begins to develop from friends to confidantes, Barbara learns of a relationship that has come about between Sheba and a 15 year old student-a secret that could potentially sink Sheba.

Heller's novel, written as Barbara's retrospective diary entries on the situation, provides an incredible depth of character insight into both Barbara's lonely, attention depraved existance and Sheba's unthinkable affair. There is never a dull moment, as Barbara's diary slowly unveils the ups and downs of the relationship and the scandal that it creates, with Barbara's startling honesty and well composed thoughts on the circumstances and the other characters making for a compelling, fascinating and highly entertaining read. The handful of periferal characters also help to propel the story forward in a manner that is interesting and thought-provoking. 

Zoe Heller's brilliant novel is without a doubt one of the best of the new century, providing greater character depth than most authors can. I strongly recommend that you read this masterpiece before seeing the film!
