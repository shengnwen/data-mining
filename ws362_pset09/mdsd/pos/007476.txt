AMAZING BOOK.  If you are a David Blaine fan it is a must have.  I will keep this review short.  He goes into the history of magic, explaining the lifes of many famous magicians.  He tells his own story from his childhood to his stunt Frozan in Time.  He also explains how he first started in magic to where he is now.  He explains a couple of card tricks, which is nice.  He explains Buried Alive, Frozen in Time, and Vertigo.  All I have to say is the book is amazing, and after I read this book the magic really got into me and I have started practicing and learning magic.
