This book is on architecture and energy conservation. From the cover - This book is for designers who want to consider the form-generation potential of sun, wind, and light in the earliest stages of the design process. The book stresses the energy implications of using the sun, wind, and light. However, it is organized by the architectural elements designers manipulate - streets, open spaces and buildings, rooms and courtyards, and walls, roofs, floors, and windows. The book is divided into three sections : Design Strategies, Analysis Techniques, and Strategies for Supplementing Passive Systems. Extensively referenced and indexed
