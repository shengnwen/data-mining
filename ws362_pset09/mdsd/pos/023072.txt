Sturgeon was always very much a humane writer. This shows in this, his first novel. Even thought it's not listed as a "juvenile," it pretty much comes across as one. The hero is a little boy with abusive step-parents. He even gets his hand maimed. He ends up on the streets, where he joins a carnival with a circus sideshow. Toss in two Jewels from Space, with an intelligence that can't be understood by humans, and now Sturgeon's Dickensesque novel turns into science fiction. Not perfect by any means, but it's always been my favorite Sturgeon novel
