Pictures of Hollis woods... was an interesting book. About a 13 year old girl that has been in every foster home imaginable. She finally finds a good home with Josie, a little forgetful woman. Who enjoys having Hollis around but the government comes to take her away. This book was a great book. But I have read better books than it.Don't take my opinion for you go head and read "pictures of Hollis woods.
