As a practitioner and teacher of Vedic astrology, I have a huge collection of Vedic astrology books. If I were to take only one to a desert island, this would be it. For both beginners and advanced astrologers, this book is a treasure trove of both information and guidance on how to approach a Vedic chart. I strongly disagree with the person who thought that this book departed, in any meaningful way, from classical Vedic astrology. This book, in my estimation, is truer to classical Vedic astrology by far than any other book written by an English-speaking author. Bravo!
