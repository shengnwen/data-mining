There is no other book that comes close to this one in terms of simply being enjoyable to read and informative at the same time. This comes from a guy who started out just like us amateurs so he puts out the information that he knows we want to know. No roll call sheets or budgets or anything serious like that. We got into this business because it's fun and this book brings back and highlights all the fun points. Buy this now....Buy two.
