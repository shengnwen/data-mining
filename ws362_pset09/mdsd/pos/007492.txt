This 2003 paperback is a good first book on the Desert Fathers. Benedicta Ward's introduction is excellent and her scholarship within the field is well known. This volume is a translation of the Latin text, Verba Seniorum, which arranges the stories and sayings according to topics (Self-Control, Fortitude, Unceasing Prayer, Humility, Charity, etc.) This particular text would make an excellent addition to a home library or a textbook for highschool or college students.  A more complete version of these ancient texts can be found in Benedicta Ward's Sayings of the Desert Fathers (Cistercian publications,1975) and The Lives of the Desert Fathers, translated by Norman Russell with a monograph by Benedicta Ward (Cistercian publications, 1981.)
