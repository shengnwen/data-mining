I bought this book because Janis, the author, was my writing teacher. Once I started I couldn't put it down! It was great! She does of a wonderful job of putting the ups and downs of the adoption of her son onto paper. It will take you to the busy world of russia and into the place she can't wait to take her son from. It also deals with her honest fears of motherhood and her capability of raising that little boy she knew only from a photograph. I totally recommend it for a wonderful read that will leave you longing for more
