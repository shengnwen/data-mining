The Simple Guide to Self-Publishing is clear, accurate and up-to-date. Mark Ortman has condensed years of experience into concise and valuable checklists (complete with check-off boxes). Now the book has been revised  again to include electronic and on-demand printing. You will refer to this  book again and again. DanPoynter@ParaPublishing.co
