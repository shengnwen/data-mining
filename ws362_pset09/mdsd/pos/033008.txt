This book was exactly what I was looking for. I have been an initiate for many years and yet all of this had passed me by. Gardiner weaves the tale of the serpent through the book like a true adept. I can only think that he was a master in a past life. I read The Serpent Grail, his previous work and found it full of information, but Secrets of the Serpent is all that and more. Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is even related and brought to confront the ancient powers of the mythical snake. Man, this answers everything. David Icke's aliens and Sitchin's planetary nonsense is now old-hat. Stand aside sirs, Gardiner has arrived
