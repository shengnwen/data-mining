Not only are the pictures dynamic, but the rhymes about each instrument really capture the essence of each voice.  The oboe is described as "gleeful, bleating, moaning, pleading... through its throbbing double-reeding" - dead on description.  The illustrations are whimsical, accurate, and lively.  My two toddlers ask for it every single night.  As a professional musician and teacher, this is exactly what I was looking for in a children's book.  The dogs and cats are appealing to little eyes, as well.
