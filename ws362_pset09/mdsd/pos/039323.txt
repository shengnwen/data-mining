I have bought maybe 8 of these books and may buy more if I think of other people who would want it. I have a few set aside for last minute gifts. It's almost like you can't have it out on the coffee table because people pick it up and refuse to put it down or socialize until I tell them that it's a gift for them and they can take it home.  Then they relax and we can get back to socializing. It would probably be best in the guest room or as a gift.There is something about it that is addictive: being a little fly on the wall and reading people's secrets, many of which make you squirm. Guilty pleasures.  It's very unique, and the times that I have given it as birthday gifts have been huge hits. People just love it, the husbands and the wives, both. I have seen people from age 36 to age 72 love it equally. It is maybe not for the more connservtive person who might be easily shocked, but other than that, it's a pretty universally unique and fascinating book
