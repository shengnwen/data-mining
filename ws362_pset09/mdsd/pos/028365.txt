Thirteen Days recounts the days that the United States seemed to be on the brink of a nuclear war.  The author Robert F. Kennedy chronicled his role in the think-tank that steared the United States out of this crisis in the book.  It is a tragedy that the book was never truly completed as Kennedy intended to add a section that questioned the ethics of war and nuclear war.  It is a shame that the world was robbed of the view point of his scholarly mind.

In the era of the cable news networks , much of the information in this book seems thin.  There is so much Kennedy could have elaborated on in this book.  In its time, the book gave Americans their deepest look into the Kennedy White House.  Many other books have more indepth accounts of the Cuban Missle Crisis, but none have the personal touch of a Kennedy.  Learning from the disaster caused by groupthink that caused the failure of the Bay of Pigs,  President Kennedy surrounded himself with a diverse group that was willing to debate all sides of the issue.  All ideas were encouraged, but only one was selected.  Seeing multiple view points allowed them to explore all the aspects of the issue, including how the Soviets might react/feel.  Great thinkers traditionally explore topics in very open forums such as this.  There is no narrow minded partisanism here, just a quest for peace.  Though slight, this is a great account of one of the finest hours in the Kennedy administration.
