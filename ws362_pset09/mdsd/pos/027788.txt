I was extremely happy with the service I receivec.  I requested that this book be sent to the county jail, via Overnight Mail, for my son, and it wzs received the next day.  Time was of the essence and you delivered.  I can't rate the book myself, because it was not for me.  I would definitely use Amazon.com again
