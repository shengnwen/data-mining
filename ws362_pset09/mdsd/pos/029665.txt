Serge Trifkovic's book is clear and concise and not polically correct.  The book is divided into five parts and the first four are worthy of five stars, but the last part, "the Solutions" needs more development,should be longe, and in parts questinable implementation may result in a country no one wants to live in either and brings down the overall rating of this otherwise spectacular book.  

Now let me be clear, there are many good muslim people, if not most of the muslim believers are good people, who focus on the more noteworthy tenets of Islam - that is not the arguement.  The arguement presented here is that Jihadists are logically following Islam's teachings to their conculsion.  The radical results of terrorism is actually the logical outworking of Islam as spelled out in many Koranic text, the Hadiths, and Islamic history.

Leftists politcally bent individuals, more concerned in pursiung an anti-Christian society than the truth of the current threat, typically provide silly and disturbing arguements for Islam and blaming American society.  Trifkovic demolishes such nonsense.  His overall critqie of Europe is fair and in regards to Spain painfully accurate.

Now, let us hope our leaders truely understands the threat and protect all Americans (Christians, Jews, seculars, and Muslims, etc),from this threat
