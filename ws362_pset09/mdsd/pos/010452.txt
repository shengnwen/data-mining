We used this book on a recent trip to Normandy.  The hotel ratings were very good & helped us determine if that was where we wanted to stay.  He doesn't mention whether or not a particular placed is closed during the winter & we did find one of our hotels was closed, but the ones open were exactly as he described.  The book was most helpful in our decisions as to what we wanted to see & do.  I would recommend this for anyone making a trip to France.  Be sure & get the latest edition, as things due change
