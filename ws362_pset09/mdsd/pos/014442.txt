I'm glad I bought this book. 

In the first part there are lot of pictures about stone use in the garden (stairs, patios, walls, paths...). For someone who needs the ideas or insight of stone landscaping possibilities I would recommend it. Of course the number of examples is limited with the number of pages, but it is in accordance with the price.

In the second part are how to instructions which are also OK. This kind of instructions can be found also in other books, so for me the reason for buying this book would be the first part.
