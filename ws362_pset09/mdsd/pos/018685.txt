I was given a complimentary copy of this book for purposes of review. I found this cookbook very useful. It offers numerous recipes in every food category, pulling in from most ethnic sources as well as tradition American versions. The level of complexity of the recipes is good; easy enough for a weeknight meal, yet not so unidimensional as a 3-ingredient cookbook.

Time after time, the recipe in this book mirrored my own tried and true version. If you want an encyclopedic range of recipe that will not disappoint you, you should give this book consideration
