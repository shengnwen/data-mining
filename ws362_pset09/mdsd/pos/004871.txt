This is a high quality book at a very decent price, it is interesting and covers almost all facets of the forests, and in a way, goes a little bit beyond that with sections on butterflys, insects and other plants besides trees.Like it is mentioned in other reviews, this is not a guide per say to plants, animals,etc.but it is a fairly decent read
