Stranger at the Gate was the first  book I had ever read dealing with the struggles of a gay Christian.  It is a touching,  wonderful, difficult story about Mel White's struggle to come to terms with his sexual orientation. Anyone who is open to the idea that God loves everyone and deals with people through grace will appreciate the honesty of this book.  It makes one think and re-examine old prejudices.  Those who are close minded and unable to listen to a viewpoint  that may be different from the traditional thinking will find this story offensive.   Whatever your thinking, this is a fascinating story well worth reading.
