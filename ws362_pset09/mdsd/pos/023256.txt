For your information, the author Mr. Geo Stone has a site at: www.suicidemethods.net

In the site he writes, "The book is out-of-print. Publisher (Carroll & Graf) says they will re-print "soon. Feel free to contact them---I'm sure they'd love to hear from you."

I think the original price for the book was $27.95.

Due to the price of it I have not read it yet. But I believe that people who are determined to end their lives will do so eventurally no matter how we try to stop it. I hear lots of suicide that ended up in taking so long and so painful. Those who really want to die already experienced so much pain mentally and physically prior to the suicide, and I believe that at least when they die it should be painless as they don't need more pain on top of the pain they went through. 

If I could choose, I would like to die from a natural cause, that is, an old age. That is my choice, and as much as my choice being vaild, I value other people's choices. Everyone has a different curcumstances, and I don't think I completely understand how others feel. I wish I could help all beings, but I am very limited.   

Since I have not read this book, it is impossible to tell if the content is fit in terms of physiological effectiveness. Also, I want to add that I believe that this type of book do not make people kill themselves. It is the society and its people that have been producing misery in people.
