I found this book to be very helpful! I loved it. I have been exercising for many years using at home videos. I actually like this book more then some of the Kathy Smith Videos I have used! I wanted to get more involved with working out with weights now that I am in my 40's. The book covers the benefits of working out with weights, nutrition and covers lots of different exercises for each muscle group.(proper form is covered and explained in detail) for the entire body along with a suggested schedule or routine for each week. I have been very happy with the routines and do them entirely at home and have seen great results
