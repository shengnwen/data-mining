This book has saved me $$$$ in lessons.  I have been golfing for 18mos. and have been seeing steady signs of improvement in my game.  Most of my tips come from others on the golf course.
The best tip I ever got on the golf course would be the suggestion to buy this book.

I read this book last night- took about 3- 3 1/2 hours to read it thoroughly and the way you're supposed to(make sure club is in your hands).  Then I went to the range this morning and worked on my problem areas.  This book explained clearly and concisely the dynamics and gist of the golf swing.  How to hold the club, how to set-up (address) the ball, coil and uncoil your swing- simply unbelievable.  

This is the GOLF BIBLE in my eyes right now.  Never have I hit so accurately in the range, course, or wherever.  It has made me excited to practice.

MY SUGGESTION:  If you're serious about getting good then read this book, highlight and flag important points then spend time at the range. 

I have not even brought my new swing to the course yet- and I don't plan to until I can spend 3-5 more practice sessions at the range.  

I AM A BORN AGAIN GOLFER!!!!!!
