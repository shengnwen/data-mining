Such sad lives were led by the the Bronte's, loneliness, loss, despair, all were experienced and fed into the imaginations on charlotte, emily and anne. This book is a brilliant book by E C Gaskell (who i normally dont  really like), it is basically a collection of letters by charlotte  and a  great narrative, when speaking of the deaths of emily, anne and charlotte,  i actually felt tears in my eyes
