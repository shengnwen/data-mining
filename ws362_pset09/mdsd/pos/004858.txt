I liked this book because it was very fast paced and constantly kept me guessing.  Also the book kept moving along from one subject to the next, it didn't really 'stop to smell the roses.'  One thing I didn't like about this book was that even though it was a quick read, there was a lot it didn't explain, such as some of the science.  Altogether, I liked this book and recomend it to everyone!
