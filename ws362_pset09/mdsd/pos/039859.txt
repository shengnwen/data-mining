The arguments are persuasive...but only on one side.  Read the book and find out just who has the best arguments.  I think that it will become abundently clear just who really knows their stuff and who guards the henhouse of conformity.  It is a good book and a easy read.  Though some of the arguments are quite insulting.  What do they think we are...minds of mush?  I believe that anyone who wants to confirm their doubts of one side of the argument or the other should read this book.  It serves as great ammo for the argument of technical points, but most importantly offers insight into the minds of the establishment.  I just have to shake my head slowly and sadly.  A great book overall
