If you can only get 1 book about Bettas this should be it. Dr. Goldstein is an expert and although I do disagree with some of his thoughts on the need to keep Betta variety names to a strict scientific form, I realise his intentions are good as well as valid. His overview of the Betta world is most complete and the many less known "wild" betta species receive excellent coverage in his effort. I do wish it had more photos of the more recent varieties that have been developed such as the Crowntail and Halfmoon but the descriptions are very good and a web directory guides readers to sites which will fill in the gaps. Any of Dr. Goldsteins books are an excellent addition to the Betta or other tropical fish fanciers library. I've been keeping Bettas for more than 40 years now and Dr. Goldstein's books were there every step of the way. This book will most definitely enhance your pleasure in keeping these fascinating little fish
