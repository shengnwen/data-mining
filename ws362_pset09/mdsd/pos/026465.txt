This book is extremely easy to read, and is good for day to day administration, however for a serious dose of what goes on behind the scenes with exchange you will want something a little deeper.  However for the ease of reading and pretty complete coverage of the topic I give it a 4.  It will teach you about %90 of what is needed to adminster exchange
