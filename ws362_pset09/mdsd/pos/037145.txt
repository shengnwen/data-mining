I love homes and history and I have some family ties to the early days of Long Island and New York. This book added a great amount of magic and mystery to the Gold Coast. I was blown away by some of the stories of excess and "beating the Jones'" but it was also sad and touching to hear of the many tragedies that struck the families and many of the homes. It was fun to see the homes at their high point but very sad to see that many have decayed into ruins through many years of neglect or vandalism. It is an era that is gone and in our past but it is brought back to life each time I sit down and pick this book up. It is a great addition to my library, I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in homes or history. The "Gold Coast" was the right title
