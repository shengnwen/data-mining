I'll admit more interest in the actions of a distant relative during the British retreat to Boston.  However, the author was successful in putting a magnifying glass on this first historic event in United States history.  Countless details lost in more general history books are brillantly illuminated - the actions of a few dozen named individuals is overshadowed by countless unnamed men who dogged the British every foot of the way.    

It is no wonder we named an aircraft carrier after this event!
