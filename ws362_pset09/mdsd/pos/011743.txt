This book was very informative, for future efforts in Nanotechnology.  Mr. Drexler put a lot of though on the Assembler aspects.  I really got the book for the Cryonics chapter which i found very good.  If you're doing anything at all with nanotechnology then you must read this book, Mr. Drexler put this technology on the map! Over all it was a excellent read that i would recommend for other who are interested in Nanotechnology
