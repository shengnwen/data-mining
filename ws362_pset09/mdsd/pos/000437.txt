Name Withheld, is the third Jance book I have read and while Trial by Fury was by the best so far, this book was excellent in its own right. It makes JP Beaumont seem very real and likable. The plot twists and turns make you keep reading and overall it makes me want to go to the bookstore and grab another Jance book just to see what Beaumont will be up to next
