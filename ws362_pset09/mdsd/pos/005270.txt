The idea of mapping is not new to me, but actually using it as a tool in teaching and for my personal life is. Nancy Margulies' excellent book  shows, in just enough detail, how to create a map for many different purposes, directions for using with different ages - children through adults; gives suggestions for drawing concepts in a simplified way, and offers encouragement to just do it. The only suggestion I have for improvement is to update the website info at the end of the book.
