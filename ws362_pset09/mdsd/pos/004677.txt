This cleverly written book redeemed the value of psycho-therapy in my eyes. This profession is really a craft, since it relies on strategy and tactics to help the patient reclaim control over his/her life. In therapy, appeals to reason are often ineffective. And so are attempts to tell the patient "what to do". The first step in all successful therapy is responsibility assumption, aimed at behavior change. The focus is not so much on "content" but on "process"; not on the "what," but on the "how." A good therapist helps the patients "unfold"; he sheds light on patterns and meanings, and helps them assume responsibility. A therapist treats the patients as "equals" (This is why I could NEVER be a therapist).
Yalom emphasizes the importance not only of an archeological dig of the past, but of a loving, involved presence in the here and now. He also suggests that we should never categorize people because there is so much more to a person than the contours of his/her problem: in other words the "other" is ultimately unknowable. 
Therapists also have to deal with transference and counter-transference; dream interpretation; and deep meaning behind certain words and sentences of their patients. 
The book is called "Love's executioner" because Yalom sometimes has to help patients unmask the projections behind and infatuations attached to their patients' "love."
