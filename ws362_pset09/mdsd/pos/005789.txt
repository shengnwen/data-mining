The Short Victorious War, the third installment in David Weber's outstanding Honor Harrington series, is a very enjoyable read.  Honor is an medical leave healing from injuries suffered in The Honor of the Queen when she thwarted the assassination attempt on Grayson Protector Benjamin Mayhew.  Hostilities between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven erupt into an actual shooting war.  The PRH is a cradle-to-the-grave welfare state whose economy has gone into the toilet, as the Republic struggles to continue to support the staggering number of Dolists among its population.  The Peeps' ususal remedy for this problem is to invade planets or solar sytems that are stronger economically, but weaker militarily.  But now they are left with only weak agricultural powers to contend with, or they could go after the extremely powerful Manticorans.  Honor is eager to return to space, and gets to do so, this time in command of the HMS Nike.  Her nemesis Captain Lord Pavel Young returns as well.  The Short Victorious War is a worthwhile read, and the Honor Harrington series is becoming addictive for me, as I can't wait to read Book Four (Field of Dishonor).
