The Master Puppeteer is a very suspenseful book about a boy living in a puppet theater as an apprentice.  His family is very poor and they are just trying to stay alive.  I recommend this book to anyone.  It may not be your favorite book but it won't be your least.  The book really makes you predict what will happen next.  The only part that was hard to concentrate on were all of the Japanese names, other than that it was an easy read.  Everything in the story had a purpose in the end.  There wasn't a single piece of information that could have been left out.  I personally have always enjoyed reading about life and death situations or any type of action and adventure book.  If you like reading adventure books you will enjoy this book
