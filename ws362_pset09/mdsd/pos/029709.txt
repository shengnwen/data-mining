While nowhere near as involved as the books (I actually prefer the Speaker books to the Shadow books), this is a fun diversion. I particularly enjoyed the banter between John Paul and Teresa, especially given the fact that they are so often overlooked (in Peter's mind) - they are obviously quite formidable intelligences themsleves.

The original Ender's Game novella was also very interesting as a curiosity, although the book was definitely a vast improvement
