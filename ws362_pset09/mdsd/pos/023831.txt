This book is like having hundreds of friends to tell you what breastfeeding is really like. Barbara Behrmann has effectively captured the variety and depth of the breastfeeding experience by re-telling women's stories.  While the book is not a substitute for detailed problem-solving advice, there is a lot of basic information about how breastfeeding works woven into the stories women told. Sidebars in the text quickly link the reader to other resources.  I recommend this book to women who want to nurse their babies, want to hear other women's experiences and/or haven't found much of a support system yet.
