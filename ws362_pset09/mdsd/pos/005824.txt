If you liked The Da Vinci Code, go for this novel. Not surprinsingly it was a best seller in Europe. The English version came a little bit late (Amazon has the original Spanish version, "La Cena Secreta"). Mr. Sierra did three years of research with trips to Rome, Milan, and Florence before writing this novel; and he claims he started writing it before Dan Brown's success. The plot is based on several "anomalies" you can find on Da Vinci's famous Last Supper, and surprisingly the Holy Inquisition didn't object or did they?. Buy a good reproduction of the painting to follow the clues through the reading. Can you guess which of the apostles in the painting is Leonardo Da Vinci himself? 

To my taste "The Secret Supper" is based on more solid evidence and less speculation than "The Da Vinci Code", but that does not make it less interesting, on the contrary. The story is presented through the eyes of a high ranking monk of the Holy Inquisition, which makes the evolution of the plot very unique. Here you will not find the religious controversy caused by Dan Brown's book. 

Highly recommended, specially if you enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons. I am looking forward to read some of the other novels by this author(unfortunately, they are in Spanish only).
