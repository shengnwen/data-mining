Dr. Weil and Rosie Daley have done an excellent job with this cookbook. First of all, the pictures are beautiful & inspiring. And the nutrition advice and cooking tips scattered throughout the book are a welcome break from the typical recipe-after-recipe format. The cookbook has a personal feel to it, enhanced by the comments preceding many of the recipes (gotta love hearing WHY you should bother with a recipe - rather than the assumption that if it's there, you'll make it). 

The layout is easy on the eyes and the recipes I've tried so far, yummy! Especially tasty are the applesauce (can't get better than that) and potato pancakes.
