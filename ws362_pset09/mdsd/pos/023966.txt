After a few Brockman SEAL stories, this is a welcome change.  I liked everything about it, including Cooper and Josie having to get books on childcare so they could learn enough to do it.  One reviewer thought Josie was too inflexible, but I have been where Josie is and I felt her character was right on target.  Yes, she took terrible advantage of Cooper's love for her, to the point where she almost lost him but poverty makes you do that and it is very hard to let go of the fear.  If your parents were children during the Depression, you know the feeling because they don't let you forget the fear either.  This is a couple, both professionals dedicated to their careers, who are suddenly faced with responsibility for little people and I loved Cooper for not letting these children go to strangers.  Do not, do not, pass this one up.  I read it and immediately began to read it again.  Definitely a keeper and one of Brockmann's best
