I found this (unabridged audio) book at the library - knew nothing about the series or the author.  What a pleasant surprise!  Very well written, a meticulously crafted story that gently unfolds in a way that engages you from the start without any bumps or discrepancies, using a language and style that seem to come from the very times that it describes.  Written with an obvious affection for the characters portrayed.  And Stephen Thorne's narration is equally masterful.  My recent joy at discovering that there are at least 17 other books in the series had my daughters rolling their eyes like crazy in the bookstore.  Can't wait to read more
