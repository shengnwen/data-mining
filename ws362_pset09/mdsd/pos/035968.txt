It had a different story line to it - and I liked it. Della had struggled for years with the death of her husband, Clarence (a rebel soldier during the CW). She never was able to tell him her true feelings before his death to apologize for the tone in her last letter to him. Not knowing if he even got it. Then James Cameron, a gun-drawin' lawman, show up bringing up memories all over again. James, who was with her husband when he died, brings Clarence's last letter to Della along with all of the letters that Della had written Clarence and their wedding picture found on his body, forcing her to resolve her feelings. Only there is some misconception here because Della is thinking James was a friend of Clarence's when actually he was the yankee soldier that killed Clarence and has lived with the guilt of it all these years. And with all of this going on - James is staying with Della on her farm, sleeping in the barn, seeing how poorly she is living. He starts helping out and they get close spending time together. It is the sweetest story. For me it was an intense story with a twist at the end. I enjoyed it and hope you give it a try
