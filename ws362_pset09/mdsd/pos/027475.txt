I am a sucker for a story in a foreign country.  LeCarre is an great writer, and made the African scene very realistic.  He paints a very clear political picture of Kenya that is probably not far from the real political situation in many African nations.  As a missionary in a third world country, I can understand how paternalism and racism sneaks into foreigner's minds.  The Western characters in Constant Gardener exhibit extreme paternalistic attitudes toward Africa and though ugly and obviously wrong, many foreigners use these attitudes to deal with their own culture shock.  The hero of the story had no problem bonding with the people, which is probably the reason for her healthy attitude.  When foreigners spend time and build relationships with the people of the country, they will bond with these people and begin seeing them for what they are- equals.  But the majority of the characters in this book spend their time in their Western homes, only seeing nationals who are servants.  Are these Westerners bad people?  Probably not.  But they have succumbed to paternalism and racism because of their lack of contact and relationships with the people. 

As much as the above paragraph may appear to be a review for a non-fiction book, this book is in fact fiction.  The story is good, especially in the beginning.  But as the story goes on, the end becomes more and more inevitable.  When a fiction book has an inevitable ending, I begin to lose interest.  This was my first LeCarre book, and I look forward to reading others of his novels.
