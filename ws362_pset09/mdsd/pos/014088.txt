I thought this book was great for my first book on investing.  My husband and I are getting ready to invest in our first property and I wanted to be a part of our investments so I am starting with educating myself.  This book was really inspirational and motivating which helps when taking a risk.  It shows that anyone can invest no matter what income you have to start with.  I would highly suggest reading this book if investing is something your thinking of doing.  I hope you enjoy!
