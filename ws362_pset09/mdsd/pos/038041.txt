Jesus and Buddha is one of the better books about religion out there.  Some might criticize the quotes as lacking but that's what they are, quotes.  I found it hilarious in the intro that all the things Jesus said in the bible would amount to two pages.  How is it, that we can live in a world where people are willing to do extremes in the name of guy that we know next to nothing about.  I will say this, both Jesus and the Buddha are sage lights.  No need to worry of the stones thrown by whoever or the four noble truths and eight fold path, just read what the two great man had to say themselves.  Isn't it funny these two great men are tought from third person, Jesus(Mark, Luke, Matthew) and the Buddha (his students) and like Socrates (Plato) we still study these great men.  So the next time you ever get whitey tighties for a christmas present, don't shrug them off, take them for what they are in life and be thankful because with out them, life would be a little more draft.
