Overall, this was a good buy. Lots of good information, and it was written in part by someone who has really 'been there', so the advice comes off as realistic, not clinical and removed. I also like that this book addresses a wide variety of issues, for example, how to coordinate ABA and speech therapy programs, and how to work on things that aren't strictly 'traditional' ABA, like joint attention skills. A lot of books on autism give you so much background and theory but little in the way of actual, here-and-now, take-action advice, and this book does that.

I will say that I agree with those who dislike the book's dismissal of most all other, non-ABA therapies. Yes, the author does provide some research to back this up, but to say that this research is incomplete would be a gigantic understatement at best. A few studies are cited saying that this supplement or that 'alternative therapy' were unsuccessful, yes. The problem with this is that it ignores the fact that, for the most part, NO comparative research has been done on other treatments. It's not that the research exists and proves that ABA is most effective. It's simply that most other therapies (RDI, Floortime, DIR, natural language paradigm, etc., almost all of the nutritional programs,) have never been studied, and have certainly never been studied at the 40-hour a week levels that ABA uses. It's like going to a doctor and hearing "Well, we know that this drug works for about 50% of people. And these other drugs may or may not work, but we've never done any studies to find out." A very frustrating situation, and hopefully one that will change in the future.
