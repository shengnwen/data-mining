and this one was just wonderful.  If you are one to dissect a book, maybe this isn't for you, I like to read just for the fun of it.  I found it light and even a little corny but I enjoyed it all the same, I could even picture some of my Southern neighbors in the storyline.  Sit back, kick your shoes off and read for the fun of it
