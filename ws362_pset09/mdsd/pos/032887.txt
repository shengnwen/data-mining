Mr. Hitchcock's book has made my life a lot easier. All the info you need is right there. I'm sure you could take the time to look some of it up, but there are a lot of techniques and tricks that I never would have thought of. I especially like the Searcher's Secrets that are highlighted throughout the book. 

Then there is the discussion of Usenet as a resource. Most people think that the World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet are the same things, but that's only because browser programs make it easy to surf the Web. Hitchcock explains how to use the thousands of discussion groups on Usenet to answer specific questions.

The thing I really like the most is the chapter on the European Patent Office (EPO). If my patent search at the US Patent Office turns up some foreign patents, I can check them out online. There is even a way to translate the text of foreign patents into English for FREE! That little trick has already saved me about 10 times the cost of the book in translation fees.

Great job!
