I thought this one in the Kinsey series was quite different than Sue's others.  The beginning and the end of the novel were very exciting, but in the middle it was a little slow.  She seemed to be thinking and writing on a higher order for this one.  Make sure to pay very close attention to Agnes's clues near the beginning of the novel.  However, There were a couple of things that bothered me with the story.  Kinsey seemed to piece everything together quite easily together with Agnes's past.  It wasn't that clear for me on who was whom.  The character of Irene was obnoxious in the way she was always sickly.  Also, there didn't seem to be any apparent attraction between kinsey and the bodyguard, and then boom, they are romantically connected. All and all, I like this one and E is for Evidence the most so far in the series.
