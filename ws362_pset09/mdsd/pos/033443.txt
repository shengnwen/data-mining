"Death Comes to the Archbishop" is one of the most moving books I have ever experienced.

In many ways the American Southwest has never been protrayed better than in this Willa Cather.  Quiet as the desert itself, this story evokes the all that is best about the people and the places of that area.

Magical is the best word I can use for this book.  Magical in its evoking of the American Frontier.  Magical in its representation of a humble servant of God.  Magical in Cather's language and images.  Magical in its use of language.

One of my favorite novels.  My introduction to Cather and her unique style.  Whatever happened to writers like this?

Any Cather book is also a treat in audio forms.  The beauty of the language is even more apparent when you can hear the words and the images.
