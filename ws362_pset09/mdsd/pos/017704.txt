     The book that I read was Shadowmancer. The author of this book is G.p. Talyor who has written a couple other books like Wormwood. This was a fantasy and fiction because it has magic in it but also has regular hman stuff in it.
     The summary of this book is about a boy who was poor and had no father because he diied at sea. His mother was very sick too so he had no one to watch after him. His name was Thomas he lived in boogle home and got food from a girl every night named Kate. He was owned by a guy named Demurral who was a priestwho gets a magic thing called the Kerivum which has a strong power. When he got to his make shift home their was a guy there named raphah. He asked Thomas to help him find someone and his name was Demurral. He had stolen something from Raphah. So when Thomas tryed to help him Thomas got pulled into the affair.
     I would rate this book from a scale of 1-10. I would give it a 8 because it was very interesting and curative. This book would be best for 10 to 13 year olds
