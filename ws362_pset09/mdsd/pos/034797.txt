Seamus Heaney writes of the Ireland he knows.  There are poems of bogs where he digs in with his pen, such as the image of &quot;The Tollund Man&quot; found dead in the bog, or Strange Fruit with  &quot;Her eyeholes blank as pools in the old workings&quot;.  There are Irish scenes of the lough (lakes) and the corncrake.  The poems span 30 years, and the British-Irish fighting in the 1970's is reflected in some sad memories.  These poems have a universal appeal and in his included Nobel lecture he states, &quot;I have already begun a journey into the wideness of the world&quot;.  I would agree with one reviewer who notes a medieval tone and there is a certain solemnity: &quot;Read poems as prayers&quot;, he states in the longer poem Station Island.  You can hear him read some of these poems in the audiotape &quot;Stepping Stones.
