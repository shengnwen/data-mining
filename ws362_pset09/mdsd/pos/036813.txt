To begin with, I have just started to explore the world of carnivorous plants (CP). I have a couple venus fly traps and am currently planning a bog garden for a few other types of CP's. Not wanting to invest money and time into something I did not know too much about, I started to browse the internet for helpful guides and growing tips. After quite a few hours on random sites I noticed a pattern. Most of the quality, high-performance CP websites and CP message boards all referenced this book as the holy grail of CP references. So I bought it.

Simply put, this book is incredible. "The Savage Garden" starts with a nice introduction/preface by the author who is also the owner of the largest CP nursery in the USA. He talks about his love for the plants and his 30+ year affair with these magnificent plants. The first section of the book discusses and explains the environmental needs of the plants and how to use the rest of the book as a guide for growing the various species. Then he goes into great detail about 12 popular CP's and even more detail about the many subdivisions and crossbreeds of a few of the species. Included is all the information you need to start (or continue) to grow CPs. 

As a beginner, this book has everything I need. After reviewing the pictures in the book, it is impossible to deny the magic of these "flesh-eating" plants. The pictures are beautiful and captured are some of the plants in all their glory capturing and digesting insects.

Bottom line: This text is the real deal. It is a comprehensive guide about carnivorous plants. After "devouring" this book after I received it, I had wonderful dreams about bog gardens and facinating plants. Truly a "must-own" for all CP lovers
