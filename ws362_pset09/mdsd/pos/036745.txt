Sue Bender is an artist who first learned of the Amish through their remarkable quilts.  Not satisfied to learn about them second hand, she was able through great perserverance to stay with two Amish families.  Plain and Simple not only recounts these visits, it also chronicles Bender's own search for meaning, simplicity, and order.  
 
Bender's book was first published in 1989 and is considered a classic.  It is well worth reading
