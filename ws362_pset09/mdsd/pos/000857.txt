This book helped me get my &quot;math&quot; legs back under me.  I feel that it is primarily aimed at those with a prior knowledge and only need a good refresher.  It starts out with basic things such as percents and long division, and it ends up touching upon some basic algebra.  If you need a good refresher, this book is great
