Bob Dubois, married and sinking fast in malaise and failure, quits his oilburner job in New Hampshire and moves to Florida. There he encounters only more failure, until he decides to transport illegal aliens from Haiti, which goes horribly wrong and many people drown. In trying to return the blood money, Dubois is killed in the Haitian community in Miami. The book is well written and very intense. Banks has a way of grabbing the reader's attention and not letting go. The only detraction for me was the subplot near the end about a Haitian woman who ends up surviving the disastrous crossing.
