I say first-runner up, because as an avid Miss America fan, I don't think the winning tome had yet to be published.  In the meantime, Ms. Bivan' book is a treat.  Very thoroughly researched, and nicely illustrated.  Many black and white photo.  Some color photos, but it definitely could use more, and from a larger range of years.  My complaint was that it seemed a &quot;puff piece&quot;, written by someone a little too closely involved with the MAO program -- and therefore lost some objectivity in  reporting of some pageant scandals of yore -- and let's face it, those are some of the most fun in a pageant history book.  Nonetheless, this is clearly a work of love on Miss Bivan's part, and a must for anyone who is a Miss America devotee. But I'm still waiting for the MAO book that will take the tiara
