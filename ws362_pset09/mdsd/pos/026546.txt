GREAT book,but.........(if you can't pass this on,then just take the 5 stars with no comment,please) eliminate all foreign films from book,EXCEPT British films. Will make more room for more American classics including more B-westerns! Otherwise, a great book and fine response from Amazon.  Bill Muhr Tucson,A
