9.3 STARS OUT OF 10!!!

Stephen King released The Dead Zone directly after his greatest book, the epic, magnificent, The Stand.  It would have been easy to come back down to earth after the last work of art, but not in this case.  While 800 pages shorter then the Stand, the Dead Zone packs quite a punch.  Forget about the plot twists and different themes.  The best part of this story is the hero Johnny Smith and his endeavors.

First year teacher Johnny Smith has everything going for him.  Loving parents, an awesome girlfriend, and a pretty good job he excels at.  Suddenly, a vicious car accident puts him in a four year coma, and when he wakes up things have changed.  Nixon is no longer President, his girlfriend has moved on, his father is broke due to Johnny's hospital bills, and his mother has become a religious freak who is pretty close to the loony bin.  Oh yeah, Johnny also has phychic flashes sometimes when he touches people where he can see the future.

I feel like I may have already spoiled too much so I will leave it at that, but Johnny's story at times is bittersweet, happy, sad, tragic, and grueling.  One of King's better books
