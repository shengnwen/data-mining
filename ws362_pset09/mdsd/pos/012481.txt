Turning Angel is a legal thriller worth reading.  Set in Natchez, Mississippi, it has some of the same characters as one of the author's earlier books, 'The Quiet Game'.

It is about a standout high school student, Kate Townsend, who is found raped and murdered.  During the investigation of the case, a prominent local doctor, Drew Elliot, becomes a suspect due to his rumored sexual involvement with the victim.  Attorney turned novelist Penn Cage, who is one of the repeat characters, is involved as the suspect has been his best friend since childhood.  Elliot wants Cage to represent him.

The story is quite well done and certainly holds one's attention.  It contains deceit, adultery, violent drug gangs, teenage thugs, and more.  There is also a great deal of exploration of the dark side of the modern day high school subculture.  

The story itself is quite riveting and well done.  I am a bit disappointed with the author in this book as he seems to try to justify or at least turn a blind eye toward relationships between middle aged men and teenage girls.  In spite of that, it is a good novel and will not bore readers
