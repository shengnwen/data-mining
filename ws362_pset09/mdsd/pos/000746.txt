This book is a history and rough diary of the life of the German General Heinz Guderian. He served in the Great War and World War II. He authored the book Achtung! Panzer. He ended his career as Inspector-General of Armored Troops and served as Chief of the Army General Staff.

This book is titled Panzer Leader. I think an alternative title should be 'How I could have won the war myself if only Hitler, Rommel and all the other generals let me.....' 
Guderian seems to have irritated almost all of his peers in one way or another but never explains why. 
The book does give quite a lot of detail into the areas in which he was while conducting the war and also goes into the tactical areas the new armored warfare that developed under his tutelage. He was a firm believer in attacking all the time and encircling the enemy with armor. He did not like the turretless assault gun concept and believed that it wasted a good tank chassis. 
The book also details his meetings with the upper command staff, which often included Hitler. He had many interesting meetings with Hitler that are quite remarkable to read. 
Guderian denies any bad press he ever received and some of it is just unbelievable. 
For example, when his command staff stayed at Tolstoi's Yasnaya Polyana estate, Guderian denies later Russian claims that furniture was burned for heat and other things vandalized. "No stick of furniture was burned, no book or manuscript touched". This is a strong denial from a busy General who obviously had time from commanding his troops to see that every stick of furniture was well cared for.

On the whole, this was an interesting book. The authors comments and insight into the other commanders and operations is fascinating and his knowledge of the art of armored warfare almost unequaled at the time.
