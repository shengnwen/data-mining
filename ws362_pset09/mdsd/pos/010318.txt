I read this book cover to cover and made a couple of the boxes.  The step by step directions were fantastic.  I was absolutely amazed at how well the boxes came out.  The best thing about the book is that it teaches you techniques that you can apply to other projects.  I ended up making all my Christmas presents this year with the techniques I learned.  I would have given this book 5 stars if it weren't for the following.  I only have a 12" band saw and almost all of the projects require a 14" or bigger band saw.  It states this only after you have read considerably deep into the book.  I was able to work around it with my table saw, but it would have been nice to give a list of tools or limitations right up front.  The finishing section wasn't all that informative either.  I wish the author had gone into the step by step detail in the finishing section the same way she did in the machining section.  With that said, I would recommend this book to anyone with a band saw.  The box designs are fun, and the techniques learned will overlap into other projects
