If you can read and understand this work then you are a better reader than I. 
I slogged through great parts of it years ago, and at some point was totally eliminated by the paradoxical obfuscations. 
Nonetheless, a few major points did emerge either from the reading of this , or the reading of other works on or about Sartre. 
Sartre sees human beings as thrown into the world. Born as nothing they, or we have to create through their own actions their identity or being. One big question for Sartre is whether this is done with authenticity , or false consciousness but I do not really understand what ' being true to oneself' or ' being authentic ' means in his terms. 
The picture of Man alone in the Universe without God struggling to create an identity and being presents Mankind in a certain sense in a heroic light. We are the sole meaning- makers of the Universe trying to fashion our meaning out of nothing. 
But what we do all in the end goes back to nothing. So it is from Nothingness to Being and back to Nothingness again. The rock rolls down the hill and at some point Sisyphus cannot push it up again. And nada is nada is nada our nada in nada. 
Now that is one way of looking at the world, a way which I understand as understandable, but it seems to me unsatisfactory ultimately. 
The answer many others would argue - and it is not in this book- is in precisely the area Sartre most rejects, the religious. The belief in God and the creation of our own life and work in cooperation with  God. But this is of course not the message that Sartre accepts
