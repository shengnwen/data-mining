Drawing Lessons by Tracy Mack tells about  girl named Rory. She lives with her two parents and has a best friend named Nicole. Rory and her father both love to paint, and do it all the time. One day Rory finds out that her father is seeing another woman. Rory's father leaves the house, and Rory becomes very depressed. She stops drawing and painting all together, and when Nicole gets a boyfriend, Rory feels very left out and hurt. The characters and plot are perfect for the story line. This is a surprising story and I would definately reccomend it to any of my friends
