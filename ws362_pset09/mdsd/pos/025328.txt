The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was a fantastic book. Even though this was a long book, it took little time to complete the reading. Each chapter was as if you were there living with the characters.  The four girls are the best of friends.  It's their first summer apart. This was tramatic for the summer was the time for them to be together.  Carmen bought jeans from a thrift store. She never wore them, until Tibby spotted them in her room.  They each tried them on and they were magic becasue they fit them perfectly when each girl was a different size.  Lena then went to Greece with her grandparents, Carmen went to see her dad, Bridget went to sports camp, and Tibby stayed home working at Wallmans. They each had a time in their summer where they felt sad or lonely, though one thing changed each girls life.They would always remember the first summer apart. The pants were traveling with them to symbolize that they were together. I think that the pants not only represented magic but the love that was between them. They cared for eachother. Their great love traveled all over the world. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is the meaning of friends that are there to catch your fall.
