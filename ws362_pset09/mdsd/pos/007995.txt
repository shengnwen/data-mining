Susan Sontag has the reputation of being infinitely pretentious and self-important, which is probably true. Ordinarily I hate these qualities, but somehow I'm able to overlook them because her thought - in this collection particularly - is just that good.

"Against Interpretation" compiles nearly 30 essays dealing with works of art (literary, cinematic, theatrical, etc.). Some deal with obscure topics - "Spiritual Style In the Films of Robert Bresson", "Psychoanalysis and Norman O. Brown's 'Life Against Death'" - others have practically become household names, as is the case with the standout piece "Notes On Camp".

All the essays address aesthetic problems - often minor, but nonetheless engaging. Each essay draws you in, causing you to mull over a topic thoroughly: for example, I'd never seen Eugene Ionesco as self-absorbed and aphoristic before, but Sontag's argument about his work is so quietly persuasive, with subtle touches of mockery driving the argument further home. Same goes for her thoughts on Simone Weil.

Sontag spent her professional life making people angry and uncomfortable with her political stances, which sounded infuriating taken out of context, and surprisingly sensible when heard with an open mind. These essays show a very different side of this great thinker - but regardless of her subject, it's her quiet wit and passion that keep her work so compelling, and which make this one of my favorite books despite its obscure topics
