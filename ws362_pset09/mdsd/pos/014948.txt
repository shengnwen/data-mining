This book is about a New Yorker who engages in running drugs (Cocaine) and his adventures and dealings setting up operations in Colbumbia, Mexico and the States. It takes place in the early seventies when the smuggling &quot;sophistication&quot; was in its early stages of develpoment. The book follows Swan's rise and fall in an exciting and compelling way with some very interesting and colorful characters along the way.  I can truly reccomend this book to people interested in 70's crime and drug related storys
