In a collection of essays, Alexandra Stoddard shares her philosophy on living well and living your life one day at a time.  I own all of Ms. Stoddard's books - including those that are limited editions and out-of-print.  This book is a delight - from the fuschia ink and chapter dividers to the quotes sprinkled thoughout the book!
