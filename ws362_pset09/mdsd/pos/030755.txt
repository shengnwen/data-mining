I highly recommend this book for anyone who studies political science, democracy, or is simply interested in Latin America. It is an excelent scholarly work, which defines democracy (using Robert Dahl's definition)  and defines the criteria, and then each individual essay gives a complete  case study and rates it next to the criteria and definition.  This book  excludes countries with little or no expirience with democracy or limited  democracy, such as Cuba, and Central America (with the exception of Costa  Rica). The countries that are analyzed are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile,  Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Costa Rica, The Dominican Republic, and Mexico.   I would be hesitant to recommend this book as an introduction to the  subject. Though this work establishes a clear context and frame of  reference in which every country is being analyzed, it can sometimes be dry  reading, but the extent of expert analysis that went into this work is  overwhelming.  This book would be a great starting point for any detailed  research into Latin American politics, or would be a great read for any  student of comaparative studies in Democracy. As an introduction to  political sciene or Latin America, however, this book might be ill-suited,  I would recommend reading some of Robert Dahl's works first, or Richard S.  Hillman's  &quot;Understanding Contemporary Latin America&quot;. These are  not required, but recommended in my opinion. But, it is still a great work  and I consider it to be an essential work on the topic
