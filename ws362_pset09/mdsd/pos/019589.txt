This book is harsh, caustic, terse, and at times unbearably nostalgic. I love it. I've read it a few times, and with each successive re-reading it seems to grow in relevance. If ever a work was to be called a "diatribe", this is it.

My only complaint is that it's too short. The book reads like an essay or long editorial. Henry seems like the kind of guy who gets a lot of his ideas straight out of the Enlightenment, and it's unfortunate that he didn't spend more space fleshing his ideas out and really elaborating on the connections between the current state of intellectualism and its roots in humanism and the Enlightenment. That said, it's certainly understandable that Elitism's brevity makes it more accessible. It's a shame Henry isn't around to write a follow-up
