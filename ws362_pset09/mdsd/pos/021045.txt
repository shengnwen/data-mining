I picked it up thinking it was a spin on the voluntary simplicty view of success, but I GOT SO MUCH MORE out of it!  It is fantastic!  I have had no previous exposure to Philosophy, but this book really has me inspired to  look up some of the works written by the people he quotes in it.        Tom's idea of &quot;true success&quot; and how to achieve it can be applied  to EVERY PART of a person's life--whether it's work, home, family life,  community, etc., and still be congruent with a persons values and long-term  goals.  A REAL WINNER
