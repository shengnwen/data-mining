A serial killer's pedophilia leads him to disguise cop-suicides as murders and to toy with the investigators who unexpectedly begin to put together the pieces of his bizarre crime. Connelly alternates between the first-person perspective of the reporter who first suspects that all is not as it seems and the point of view of the murderer. Too much description of the plot will give away its many surprises, which come together in the ingenious final pages of the novel. Suffice it to say that the book offers a potent mix of ingredients that will keep most any reader going: love, sex, death, envy, personal ambition.

All of the things that Connelly does well come together in "The Poet": his ability to craft a complicated plot that nonetheless fits together like clockwork, to build a mood, set a scene, put together a tight workmanlike sentence. Best of all, the book displays his trademark noir hero whose own darkly human qualities make him the right man to locate the monster-killer whose trail he follows here. It's just perfect for the story that Jack McEvoy, the protagonist, is a reporter who stands to benefit from uncovering the crime, and that it's his own good twin who was the original murder victim.

As almost every other reviewer here has mentioned, this book is a class-1 page-turner. I read it in a day while on vacation, never slowing down except to eat. What fun! It's also kind of a kick to see how far we have come in the past ten years from the "cutting-edge" technology that helps investigators solve the crime here (the book was published in 1996). Despite the laptops that McAvoy and others lug around, Jack has to read Edgar Allan Poe's entire corpus during one sleepless night in order to identify the quotations the killer leaves as clues. Today, of course, a "google" search would do the trick in about ten seconds
