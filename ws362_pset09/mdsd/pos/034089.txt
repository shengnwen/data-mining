Yes, I realize this edition has one of the stupidest looking covers I've ever seen, particularly for a Russian novel.  However, this is one of my favorite.  The story starts out with a man being told a variety of stories about a man named Pechorin, which is enjoyable enough, yet Pechorin is one of the most amazing, entertaining, and brilliant characters in literature.  When the story moves into his tale is when the story really picks up.  He does a series of things that are entertaining as any in literature.  A combination of stealing a native princess, getting the family killed, and ultimately getting bored with her is only one element.  Getting a Russian princess to fall in love with him just to spite a companion is another element.  If you don't like darkly humored anti-heroes, this is not the book for you.  Pechorin does numerous things just to entertain himself that cost others, and it may not be for everyone.  But certain quotes such as "Suffering is the first experience that allows me to take joy in tormenting others" and "I choose to despise women over loving them because life would be too much of a melodrama otherwise."  Plain and simple, Pechorin is fun.  He brings up some interesting intellectual issues, but overall, the main attraction to this book is the character of Pechorin.  Anyone who's in the mood for a fun, darkly humored read needs to read this book.  If that is not your taste, leave it on the bookshelf.  Either way, I grew to love Pechorin and see him as the sly, mean-spirited side of me that rarely seems to surface
