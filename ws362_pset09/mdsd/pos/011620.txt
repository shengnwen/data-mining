I recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a basic understanding of radar fundamentals as well as more advanced concepts. The book covers almost every aspect of modern radar and gives extensive references for in-depth study. An unique feature of the book is its thorough discussion on imaging radar and the related digital signal processing. Many of the homework problems given at the end of each chapter also help to enhance the understanding of various concepts develped throughout the book
