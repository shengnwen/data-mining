I have ready this book twice to fully understand this book. The actual examples/workshop files in CD (which came with this book) work well and I enjoyed going through from one chapter to the next. I was very new to InDesign and this book was the first which taught me how to get started with this pro-grade publishing program. I was able to create my own marketing materials using InDesign CS2 at work. Any person who has just started learning InDesign (or any CS2 program) should start off with Adobe's Classroom in the book series.
