I came into this book with only a basic understanding of Victorian culture and an interest in  time travel. I came out smiling like a maniac after a wonderful, clever romp through a plethora of time periods and astonishing characters. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys excellent character development combined with an artful, woven mystery story worthy of any Christie novel. A wonderful book
