"The Moviegoer" by Walker Percy is a short little gem of a novel, a deft mixture of humor and pathos, that almost lives up to the reputation that it has.  The main character, Binx Bolling, lives for the fleeting moments of cinema fantasy that add shape and meaning to his seemingly pointless life.  Yet as Mardi Gras week rolls around, his life is about to take a sharp detour that will have him re-evaluating his search for meaning.

Binx makes his living, working for his wealthy uncle, selling stock options, and dating his secretaries until a new one must be found.  He spends his spare time going to movies and conversing with his aunt, who wants to conduct his direction in life.  Binx seems open to all her suggestions, never following them, floating through existence with no purpose in mind and no end in sight.

While somewhat lacking in plot, Walker Percy manages to craft a quiet hero (or perhaps antihero) of Binx.  The warm moments he shares with his handicapped brother add a depth to his character, compounded with his humorous observations about the women in his life, and the questions he is searching out answers for.  "The Moviegoer" fizzles a little at the end, reaching more of a compromise than a conclusion, leaving readers a little unsatisfied
