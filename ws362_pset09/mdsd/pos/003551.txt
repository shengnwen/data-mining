This is a lovely, uplifting book of poems.  It celebrates the gifts life provides if we would only wake and observe the natural world.  These poems bring solace to the soul.  They seem to come from a place where one's life is winding down, slowing to a comfortable and relaxed peace - as if Mary Oliver is held in the arms of the natural world near the end of life and describing how wonderful it all is.

This book tells us it is enough to be at peace with the world and to enjoy what we've been given. Now in her seventies, she may have moved beyond the inner struggles of past and worries of future.  The poems in Why I Wake Early, seem to say that for her it is now enough to observe, describe, and enjoy what nature offers.  She does not need to wrestle with meaning - just be and enjoy.

Perhaps I am too cynical, certainly less evolved or mature. However, I was hoping for more poems that touched upon the conflicts and cruelty we observe and survive.  I wanted to experience more poems with challenge and pain - like those in American Primitive.  I was hoping for poems that moved through beauty and darkness, then resolved in a wiser, deeper peace. 

So, I was disappointed because the poems in Why I Wake Early lacked angst and profound observations.  Don't get me wrong - these poems are eloquent, beautifully descriptive and gentle - full of appreciation and respect for the natural world. They are each a gift of thanks.   

I just happen to prefer the depth and range of her earlier poems.  I recommend new readers get and read her Selected Poems first, then read this book. All of her books are treasures, including this one - so whatever you do, read Mary Oliver's work. I've given books by her to many friends, and each of them comments on what amazing poems they are. She is a remarkable, gifted poet - one of the best in America
