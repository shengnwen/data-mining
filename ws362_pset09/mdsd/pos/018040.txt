I enjoyed this book, but not as much as the other two Shiloh stories.  There were a few suspensful chapters where I was begging to read the next to find out what happened.  Other than that I found the story line to be slow and very similar to the other books.  I would recommend this book.  However, if you can only read one of the Shiloh series I would highly recommend the first book
