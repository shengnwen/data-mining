I've read many fiction books where law enforcement officers have to stop a dangerous, cunning killer.  This book is better than most - a page-turner that I could not put down.  The main character, Kendra Smith, was well-developed which allowed me to better relate to her actions and motivations.  Several side plots were nicely tied up near the end of the book.  There was also a big twist that left me saying,&quot;Oh my goodness, if this is true. . .get out of the house now!&quot;  If you like simple plots, a plodding pace, and cardboard heroes, then this is NOT the book for you. :&lt;
