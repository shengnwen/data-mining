The book is very interesting and very well written.  It is composed of individual articles and essays rather than chapters, which makes it very refreshing.   In this book, French Literature is placed in its historical,  political, social, and philosophical context.  This approach allows the  reader to make more sense of the authors as well the texts.  Literature is  also viewed in the context of other artistic manifestations as well as in  its different media. The only downside that I found is that, since the book  does not aim to be exhaustive, some authors do not seem to find their place  in it, Duras and Yourcenar for example
