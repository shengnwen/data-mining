Wow! Reading all the anti-Susan comments here ought to send Parker a message. Personally, I don't think Susan is so annoying, it's just that in EVERY book we readers have to skim through the: 1) She eats/drinks like a bird; 2) My heart skips each time I look at her; 3) "You complete me" soliloquoys affirming and re-affirming Spenser's love for her. Hint: WE GET IT!

Then there's the standard dialogue/interchange between the two: 1) "You do what you have to do because it's who you are." 2) "You wouldn't be who you are if you didn't do what you do." 3) "I'm not happy with it but I accept it because you are who you are and you do what you do." JEEZ! Why do they have to keep explaining themselves to each other after all these years? Spenser's constant professions of endless love make us think the shamus doth protest too much. It's the same dialogue each and every book, and we're tired of it. These people are on their second dog already! You'd think by now they'd be as tired as we are of this conversation.

Same with Hawk. The ever-present explanation of their relationship is moot--again, we get it. Re-examining it over and over feels like filler to the devoted reader. Okay, I've got 300 pages to fill...let's see...50 pages of navel-gazing conversation with Susan; 50 pages of Hawk's sweaty, glistening, dangerous demeanor and his unswerving view of himself and the world; 10 pages of donuts and coffee and I'm a third of the way there!

That's harsh, I know. But forced to live without these tools, Spenser is more to himself and obviously the readers have picked up on it and are pleased with what they see.

One last comment: Spenser used to be a lot more interesting as a character because he was flawed. He occasionally slipped and cheated on Susan; he let that reporter die under his watch; he wasn't so sure of himself and his world and it made him more human and thus more intriguing to us all. I wouldn't mind seeing something happen to him that shook his faith to the core
