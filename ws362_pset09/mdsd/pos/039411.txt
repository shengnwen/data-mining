Hmmm. One could write a review longer than the book, it seems; I wonder if that would miss the point.  I suppose one could impose a number of interpretations upon this very brief novel, but I though of it as a rather literal story.  A very lonely and probably shy man pays a woman to spend several nights with him to see if he can ever love or be loved.  Sadly, the answer is no.  And then she is gone.  His effort to exert and enforce control proves to be impotent.  Even though he won't even allow her to voice her pleasure - why? - she seems to feelo only a reserved pity for him; not anger, hatred, resentment, fear, or any other emotion I would expect a woman in her position to feel.  Such is his own powerlessness, his malady of death.  This is an excellent book which, yes, can be read in the book store without spending any money.  Shame on you for doing that, and not supporting such inquisitive literature, and giving yourself the opportunity to re-read and study the text
