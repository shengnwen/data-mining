Louise Erdrich has written I don't know how many novels featuring Fleur Pillager and her still-increasing North Dakota Chippewa clan.  Tracks remains my favorite, mostly because of Nanapush, surely one of the most wonderful characters ever to inhabit the pages of a novel.  "Talk is an old man's last vice," Nanapush says. When he gets ill, he says "I got well by talking.  Death could not get a word in edgewise, grew discouraged, and traveled on."  You won't, you'll sit at Nanapush's feet and never want to get up, not while he's still talking.  My only complaint about Tracks is it's too short.

The Beet Queen and Love Medicine are about the same characters, not really sequels or prequels, just more stories about the same great folks.  You'll  be happy you get more than one visit
