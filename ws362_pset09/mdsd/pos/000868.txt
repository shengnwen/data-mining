I have to say, this story is the first Robin McKinley that I have ever read and though I picked it up hesitantly, I couldn't put it down! The story is fiercely poetic in it's language of heartbreaking beauty and so can tell a story of unimaginable pain. You cannot help but weep for the wonder of the pain that it weaves, and yet the story has it's moments of humor and happiness that just make you want to laugh. 
If all of his books are such, I feel I must read them all! 
Five stars, if I could give more, I would!!!!
