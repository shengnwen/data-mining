A reviewer wrote:

For example, Peikoff's piece on the analytic-synthetic distinction shows that he is completely unaware of contemporary philosophy: he begins by saying that the analytic-synthetic distinction "is accepted, in some form, by virtually every influential contemporary philosopher". But this is clearly false. The most cited paper in 20th century philosophy is Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1953, available in From A Logical Point of View) which famously (and, I think, quite effectively-much more effectively than Peikoff) attacks the distinction. Though there have been many criticisms of the paper and defenses of the distinction, many agree with Quine and he is one of the most famous philosophers of the 20th century, especially within Anglo-American philosophy. 


Really, I am just curious as to the evidence behind the claim that Quine's article is the 'most cited' paper in 20th century philosophy. Furthermore, I have no clue into the amount of comprehension that reivewer has of Quine's argument in the paper at hand. As far as the outcome of the debate he has raised -- it is far from over. In fact, it is very much alive. A J Ayer, for example, has written several intersting essays discussing the nature of not only Quine's objections, but Alonzo Church as well.
