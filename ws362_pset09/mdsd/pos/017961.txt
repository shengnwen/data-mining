THE THREE MUSKETEERS and THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO may have started the swashbuckling but with CAPTAIN BLOOD Rafael Sabatini launched it into the twentieth century with a melodramatic flourish and more sea battles than you can shake a peg-leg at. In Peter Blood, he gives us a brooding but honourable hero; a wronged man who takes to piracy because the only other choice is slavery.

Every ingredient you'd expect in a tale of piracy is present and correct; there are pieces of eight and ferocious sword fights; double-crosses and romance; and, of course, there's the triumph of good over evil. Sabatini breezes through the plot - sometimes far too quickly and often without fleshing out his characters sufficiently - and injects it with enough zest to keep you awake until the early hours. But it's the sea battles that mark this out as something special; you can practically hear the timbers creaking, the rigging humming and the cannons booming. It's exhilarating stuff and has you breathlessly turning the pages as thrill follows thrill.
