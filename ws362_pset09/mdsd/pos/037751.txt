I have just finished this book tonight.  It is the third one in a series.  I think Yada Yada Gets Real was my favorite!  As a matter of fact, I actually cried at the end(first because it was a very touching and emotional ending and secondly because well.....it was over until the next one comes out in October!)  

The title and cover almost gives the impression that these novels are "fluff" and sort of....lighthearted?  But, nothing could be further from the truth!  I find Jackson really has done an excellent job of developing the characters and creating a life that seems real.  In fact, I keep catching myself thinking these women really exist somewhere in Chicago!  I want to meet them!  

I have loved and enjoyed these novels and I am highly recommending them to my friends, however they had better not ask to borrow my copies of the books, because I don't want to give them up!
