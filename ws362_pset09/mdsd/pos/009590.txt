Browning's book is interesting and is truly a very important work that should be ready by everyone.  In describing Battalion 101 he shows how ordinary men became killers.  He also shows how men would shirk duty or attempt to avoid taking part in mass murders.  All of this makes for a very interesting read.  However, some of the interest is lost because parts of the book can be dry or stats heavy.  Still, that should not dissuade anyone from reading this book
