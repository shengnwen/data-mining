For the first 250 pages of this brilliant novel, essentially nothing happens - and boy is it entertaining!  A guy's getting ready to take his, possibly troubled, 15-year-old son (unhappily living with his ex-wife and stepfather) on a long weekend father-son trip.  Thoughout the book, I found myself laughing out loud like I was reading David Sedaris.  Ford has a brilliant command of the English language and an amazingly observant eye.  If you love excellent writing and great character development, this Pullitzer Prize winning novel will delight you
