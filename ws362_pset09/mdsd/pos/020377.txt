I especially enjoyed this book.  I have been with a close knit group of women for 20 years now and this book brought all that home to me and the fact that we are getting older and someday we will be losing some of our dear friends.  Enjoyed the personalities in the book and the message: Live life to the fullest, be accepting of others, and don't ever be afraid to say what you feel
