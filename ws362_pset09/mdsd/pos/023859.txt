This is an excellent pathophysiology book available in the market. I am right now preparing for my step 2 but I wish I would have used this book for my step 1. I have a decent score on my step 1 and I have taken the exam recently and I think if somebody masters this book they can rock the exam. This book gives excellent information regarding many diseases. I am trying to study this book right now with CMDT, which is also by the same author. Because CMDT is a very concise text book of IM it doesn't explain all the pathophysiology for a disease but this book has all the answers about the pathophysiology of a disease. And I think its a worth buying book for all the medical students, if you study this book little by little during preclinical years it will help you very much understand the IM in the clinical years. I was surprize to find some infornation which I was craving for since few years of my med school. You will even find pathophysilogy of very rare syndromes, as for example I was amazed when I read about X linked Hypophosphatemic rickets. If you are like me who wants to have explanation behind everything, get this book today, you wan't be disappointed
