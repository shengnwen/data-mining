Good financial resource

My name is Jameson Thottam and I have worked in the finance industry for quite some time (graduated from UC Berkeley and attending Wharton's MBA and focused on financial services such as such as The Loan Page, IndyMac Bank, Homestore), I would give a strong recommendation on this book to those in finance.  I would recommend, however, that if you are looking for more details on mathematical financial programing and simulation software (i.e., Linear programming, Monte Carlo Simulations, CRYSTAL BALL / SEC II / @RISK software packages).  Additionally, if you like market insider trading (i.e., technical analysis)...you can do much better.  

Hope you enjoy,
