We asked.  We pleaded.  We begged, "Pretty pleeease."  Ruth Culham responded to our request with great enthusiasm with 6+1 Traits of Writing: The Complete Guide for the Primary Grades.  And teachers across the globe cheered, "Wahoo!"  Finally, a resource book for primary educators who have been searching for child tested ideas that tackle instructional strategies and assessment techniques in one comprehensive book.  Thank you, Ruth, for doing a wonderful job of explaining each trait, equipping us with developmentally appropriate focus lessons, and reminding us that teaching writing to young authors is a process in which they need plenty of practice and opportunities, and an extra helping of patience on our part doesn't hurt.  This must have book for all teachers - novice and experienced alike - won't be another resource that is shelved after a quick glance.  It will be close at hand as it is used throughout the year to help develop the talents of young writers
