Gloria Whelan is absolutely extraordinary in this book. I am a Romanov history buff, so that's probably one reason I loved it so much. The book is beautifully written however, and I sincerly believe anyone--child or adult--would adore this book. I am a children's librarian, and I recommended it to anyone in need of a good book. That's it: Angel on the Square is a just a plain good book
