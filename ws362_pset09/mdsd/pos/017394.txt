This is the first book l have read about some of the major founders of the American Republic and it will not be the last. It has whetted my appetite to dig deeper and seek out some history books worth reading to tell me more. At times l thought l was reading a series of articles from a Psychology Today magazine, as the author delivered his judgments on everyone and everything in this period of American history but he did it with such wit and perception that l was both intrigued and stimulated by this book.

As an outsider looking in, this book brought Washington, Jefferson, Adams etc to life and l was able to form pictures of them in my mind as their lives, decisions and relationships are described in this book. It is amazing that men with such diverse interests, backgrounds and ideas could forge the beginnings of a Republic and achieve a unity and common destiny that has endured to this day. This book is a warts and all presentation of this time in history and its players. However it is a good start for an introduction to the Republic's  founder's and to gain some insight. Overall it is more reflections and comments from the author than history, so one needs to read wider and deeper.

The foundation of the American Republic has so intrigued me I went out and bought 'American Sphinx and Founding Brothers by Joseph Ellis, Adams by David McCullough and Crucible of War by Fred Anderson. I am sure this will be the start of a wonderful experience.
