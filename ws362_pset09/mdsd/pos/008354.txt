Hauser and others in the growing camp of evolutionary biologists proposing a moral "organ" have recently been vindicated by the discovery that injury to a primitive part of the brain, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, impairs moral judgment.  That puts paid to the arguments against the concept of an innate, evolved--instinctual if you will--process of moral judgment tied neither to religious teaching nor conscious thought.  Hauser in his book is using the term "moral organ" as a metaphor, a rhetorical device, but it seems now that at least part of our moral judgment does indeed reside within an organ, or shall we say it is hardwired there by evolutionary processes?

Hauser's work is pioneering, and one hopes it will continue, in his hands and those of others, to find and define our innate moral sense, where and how it resides and how it functions.

This book is not an example of the quality of writing one would like to see in presenting such an important advancement in the understanding of human morality.  For that, despite its importance to its emerging field of study, I could not give it five stars.  Unfortunately, it is so poorly written that it will not reach or hold the attention of as many people as it should.  The reader must wade through repetition, slovenliness and an irritating indirectness and plodding style throughout the book.  That detracts maddeningly, but the reader who does get through it will be rewarded and anxious to see more progress in the subject
