This 6-disc set provides audio, video and music, and some musical scores to support the examples in The Study of Orchestration Book.  The videos show players playing the various orchestral instruments to illustrate performance techniques.  The audio examples let the student hear the various orchestration techniques being discussed.  The examples and the book in general are very detailed and absolutely worth the purchase price.  I highly recommend the book and CDs to everyone studying orchestration.

The way the discs are used is there is a main menu where the user can select which instruments to view and listen to the examples.  There was a strange problem with the discs I received.  The digital material and menu do not match the book examples or the content printed on the CDs.  Strangely, CD 4 is blank (I've tried to read it on several computers) and  the main menu doesn't have any pointers that reference CD 4.  Also, the other 5 discs do not contain the contents listed on the CD, many examples are missing.  Both my book and the discs are listed as "3rd edition" and the cover graphics are identical.  I believe this is a manufacturing problem from the publisher and therefore other sets may also exhibit this problem.  Perhaps the digital content on the discs was from the 1st or 2nd edition.  I'm still working with the vendor I bought the discs from to get a new set of discs and I'm hopeful the next set I receive contains the correct digital content
