Most of the reviews here praise this book for what it is. I will try to review it on the basis of whom it will appeal to.

Regardless of your belief system, if you feel that worshiping is a meaningless exercise, but are still curious about understanding if there is something beyond the cause-and-effect realm we inhabit, you have come to the right place. Am not referring to an uninformed iconoclastic attitude towards organized religion but to a healthy dose of skepticism born out of thought and enquiry. Surely, in a world with so much pain and where genocides still occur (as in Sudan), millions of people attending places of worship and chanting prayers does seem foolish, if not outright delusional.

`I am that' introduces you to the concept of `I', the one beyond the idea of an individual self and the body. One of the most attractive features of this idea is that it stands on it own and is beyond all dogma and religion and does not need any membership or subscription (what a relief!). Despite what the Maharaj says about his concepts being so simple that anyone can comprehend them, this is a book that probably cannot be understood in its entirety by an average reader (like myself). No problem, it will still give you a new perspective at the deeper meaning of life. 

As an accompanying and a more practical book, I also recommend `Phantoms in the brain' by the neurologist VS Ramachandran. Here, the author describes the function of the various components of the brain through easy to understand experiments and dwells on the idea of consciousness. While science is no where close to discovering how the idea of a self is formed, there are tantalizing teases that it is created by the various components of brain acting together. If this is so, it only serves to prove what the Maharaj and various other realized masters like Sri Ramana have been saying all along. There must be something beyond the self to which it (the self) must wrap around
