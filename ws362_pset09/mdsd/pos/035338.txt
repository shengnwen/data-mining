Fever 1793, Laurie Halse Anderson
Imagine you're alone on a deserted street. Piles of dead bodies lay on the side of the street. Market places are empty. Young children cry behind broken windows. The steady buzz of mosquitoes fills the air. These were the streets of Philadelphia, the new capital of the United States, in 1793 when the yellow fever epidemic swept through the city, killing thousands.

Only a few months ago the town had thrived. Market places were busy, children played in the street and Matilda Cook happily helped her mother run the Cook coffee house. Then word got out about the " fever. " People started dieing. Matilda's friend Polly died before she even knew she was sick.

Before long it gets worse. People flee the city. Church bells ring constantly. Before she knows it Matilda's world is turned upside down and she finds herself alone and losing the fight to survive. Share Mattie's feelings of hopelessness, grief, joy and love as she slowly stitches her life back together

Great for historical fiction fans or anyone who likes a realistic adventure that will leave them on the edge of their seats. With real people and places, it's an enjoyable history class.
