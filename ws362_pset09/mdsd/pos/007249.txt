Even though I enjoyed this book enormously, I felt that there was too much speculation and not enough concrete facts included in it. As an avid non-fiction reader, I believe that this is key in any good biography. I can appreciate the fact that because Miss. McDaniel was a black woman living in an era that was difficult for any woman, let alone a black woman. The author did let the reader know that there just wasn't alot of documentation on even acclaimed black people in that time in history. That is a shame. I loved Miss. McDaniel's retort to a black newspaper that critizied her for portraying mostly maids in film. She said that she "would rather portray a black maid in the movies and earn a good wage, than to actually work as a maid and earn a meager salary." You go Miss. McDaniel. Overall, a good read
