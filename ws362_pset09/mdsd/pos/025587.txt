Margaret Atwood is a master of rhetoric and one of our most talented and original literary voices. She is an imaginative and probing investigator of life and relationships. "The Robber Bride" offers us the opportunity to follow the lives of three women friends through three decades and to vicariously experience the plethora of destructive deeds heaped upon each of them by "the villainess" of the piece who systematically befriends and betrays each of them.  Reading this book is akin playing with nesting dolls.....you keep opening them wondering what the next one looks like.
