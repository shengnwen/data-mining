Brian has kept this book very thorough, short and sweet. It lays an overall approach in the learning of jazz piano and to add to that, you have a complete listing of all the scales at the appendix.  It means you dont  need to purchase a scale book !  A excellent book, the chapters covered are  shown above in the review given by Coldmiser
