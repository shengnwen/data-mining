I would rate this book 5 stars. 
	Rosie's family received a letter and they are going to Chicago. The Columbian Exposition is going on. Rosie, her sister Lottie, and her brother Buster are about to get the biggest adventure of their lives.
	The reason i gave my book this rating was because it was filled with many unexpected surprises that i thought would never happen.
	I would recommend this book to many people because it is easy to understand and it is very exciting.
	I think you should read this book because it is very easy to get interested in and you can understand it very well
