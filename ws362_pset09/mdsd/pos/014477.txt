About time someone had the fortitude to dig deep for information about Kim Stanley, one of the greatest actresses of the 20th century.

In The Goddess, though the author does not agree, I found her, at the age of 32, quite believable playing a 16-year-old. Her immense talent made her voice young, the flicking of her hair young, the set of her shoulders young. Like Brando, whose weight disappeared when he smiled, the lines under Kim Stanley's eyes disappeared, or seemed to, when she played 16.

Kim Stanley could act with her back turned to the audience, and there was no mistaking what her character was thinking.
