In anyone else's hands, the subject matter here--a young man's attempt to atone for two deaths he accidentally causes--could be grim stuff. Not with Tyler. In her hands, Ian's story is poignant and often hilarious, without the author ever ridiculing Ian's genuine religious faith or his fellow believers.

As the story unfolds over many years, each third-person chapter here is told from a different point of view--that of Ian as a teenager and later at different points in his adult life, that of Ian's aging father, and that of each of the children Ian raises. Tyler portrays all of these characters convincingly. The chapters told from the children's point of view are particularly good--the children are observant and intelligent without being irritatingly precocious.

Though Tyler focuses on her characters, not the society around them, we subtly see that change too. At the beginning of the story, Ian's family and neighborhood are close-knit; toward the end, there's much more of a distance between people. Tyler shows this in a few neatly placed sentences, as when one character looks through photo albums and realizes that all of the people who went to family graduations in the past had moved away by the time it came time for hers. 

I could spend all night picking out things I like about the book, but in the end, you  just need to read it for yourself.
