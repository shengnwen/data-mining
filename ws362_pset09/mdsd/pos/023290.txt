I am not a poker player..don't know how to play the game, but I was fascinated by Chris Moneymaker's book, "Moneymaker: How an Amateur Poker Player Turned $40 into $2.5 Million at the World Series of Poker". 

Though many people reading the book will know exactly how its played, I wasn't sure what Chris meant when he talked about the blind, the flop, the river etc. Chris has an explanation of the game and cards at the back of the book. Sadly I didn't realize this till I had finished the book. So take a peek at the back if you don't know how to play.

Chris, started gambling as a child. As he grows older he works hard to make a few dollars but then will rashly toss $500 or even a thousand into a bet for a sports game. 

Eventually Chris begins to play the game of poker and enters a $40 Pokerstars internet competition. The game goes very well...so well that Chris eventually scores first prize: a $10,000 seat at Binion"s Championship Poker. 

Chris recounts his thoughts and feelings as he faces opponents, and walks away with the grand prize of 2.5 million dollars...a nice chunk of change!

Though Chris tends to whine and make excuses for when he loses, (I was drunk...I was tired...) he writes a very interesting book. You feel like you are at the poker table with him and you get a backstage feel for the championship.

Super read and I am sure a heck of a lot more people are entering the Pokerstars $40 tournaments these days!
