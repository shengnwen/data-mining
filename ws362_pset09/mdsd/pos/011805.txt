This is a diverse and engaging collection of excerpts from a range of works, many of which I have never seen collected in "existentialist" compilations.  A good cheap overview of the major writers.  I believe these are still first edition paperbacks, and as far as I know, only Amazon.com still has them.  So if you want it, you'd better get it now.  And if you just want a single volume, inexpensive intro. to Existentialism, then this is what you want
