Alan Hollinghurst writes superb prose. He is a master wordsmith. In this novel he tells the story of Will Beckwith, a bright young gay man who lives for sex and intellectual stimulation. He is a sexual adventurer in the pre-AIDS era in London. He has one a-sexual/gay physician friend in whom he confides as well as a young hotel employee boy-toy with whom he has regular sex. He takes his sexual freedom and his priviledged class for granted. He meets Lord Nantwich, a gay gentleman in his 80's, and reluctantly agrees to help write Nantwich's memoirs based on his diaries written in Colonial Africa 60 years ago. Thus the stage is set for young Will Beckwith to begin to gain the insight that even though he and Nantwich were very similar in their youth, different age's interpretation and repression of homosexuality can lead to very different life choices and consequences.

Gay culture in 1900 and 1980 are compared in the parallel lives of Beckwith and Nantwich. This demonstrates the way gay men of younger generations may take for granted the repression and homophobia that characterized earlier periods.

The descriptions of the gay sex are as cooly rendered as the intellectual aspects of the book, Hollinghurst's speciality. Yet despite the cool veneer, Hollinghurst would have us see that it is the awareness, the awakening of class and time priviledge, that allows Will to become more fully conscious and more fully compasionate, and thus more fully alive. 

I stongly recommend this book for several reasons: it is beautifully written, it explores sexual identify over time, it is erotic, it is intellectually stimulating, it confirms the ability of human's to gain insight and moral character without becoming sentimental
