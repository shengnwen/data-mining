The Quality subject is above all a signal of commitment through the life . The ancient Greeks always told the man crossed the Lethes river and since that moment lost their references and direct hot line with the Cosmos .
The sense of horizontality expresed as the real vehicle of the will, conceived as the last consequence of a unexhaustive fight against the fate is in last instance, what it allows the life be a wonderful experience .
Crosby reminds us over and over the hidden costs of the lack of the Quality considered as overwork, overeffort, waste of the unvaluable time rework ,redesign , manwork , loss of competitivity understood obviously as a serious share in the market.
There is a neglected point but closed related to the quality concept that I would really underline : the question of honor .
The inner honor inmersed in the hero call should be present in our daily behavior , it sounds so distant the term aristos employed by Karl Jaspers in his Paidea that it would be very convenient making a review around these ancient ideas .
And hero and eros are terms very related . How can you love anytthing without knowing it and how can you know it without loving it ?  This is the fundamental premise.
The quality makes the difference in every little aspect of our lives . Believe or not the quality is extremely engaged with your bliss . And I still wonder how the most of people ignore this issue , out of his workplace .
Recommendable text all the way !
