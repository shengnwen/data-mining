This is  a very good book, but there is too much of it.  The topic is the US involvement, or lack thereof, in humanitarian military missions abroad, during the last Bush years and Clinton years. Halberstam provides a thorough understanding of the decision processes at work.  He shows how past experiences shape current decisions, so that the debacle in Somalia played an important role, just as Viet Nam did.  
        However, Halberstam is too verbose and repetitious.  The book's scope is both too broad and too narrow. It is too broad in that it gets into really peripheral issues and personalities, because of Halberstam's interest and knowledge of insider US politics - some readers may love this, however irrelevant.  Yes, budget constraints play a role, but we did not need to learn all about Lloyd Bentsen and the politics of the Clinton tax cut in this particular book  At the same time, it discusses as little as possible the European politics which played a big role in our foreign policy decisions in the Balkans.
         Halberstam's list of interviews at the end is truly an impressive list.  His lack of an index, so the reader can remind himself about various people he has encountered earlier, is maddening.
