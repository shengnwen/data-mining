You learn about the web; what it is and where it
might be going.  The introduction by Neil Weintraut is a primer on the facts,  figures and
infrastructure of the web and, in itself,  is quite worth the reading.  The author is an excellent story teller and his documenting of the events in the development of the web is entertaining reading
 and is a recounting of real life,  as well.  Great
 reading for professionals as well as surfers of the web
