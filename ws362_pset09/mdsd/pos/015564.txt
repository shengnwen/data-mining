This book provides very useful information regarding the average cholesterol reductions based upon specific statin and dose being taken.  It also provides interesting information regarding how beginning doses are arrived at and how the drug companies may be encouraging doctors to prescribe dosages that are actually in excess of a patient's needs.  Provides both pros and cons and, if one assumes that the information is factual, provides an excellent base for the reader to develop own decisions.

As to alternative treatments, the book does not add a lot of valuable information but that is not why I purchased it anyway.  I was most interested in the pros and cons of using statin drugs.  For such purpose, it is an excellent source for information
