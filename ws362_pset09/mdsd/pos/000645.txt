If you are a serious printmaker this book is a must have.  It shows you how to combine traditional printmaking with digital printing, printing on different substrates, has great pictures and much more. YOU DONT NEED AN EXPENSIVE PRINTER TO FOLLOW THIS BOOK.  I have an EPSON 1280 INKJET ($399) and it works great.  The ideas and possibilities are endless. I highly recommended this book !
