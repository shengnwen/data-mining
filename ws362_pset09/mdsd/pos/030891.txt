	The Shadow of the Hegemon picks up where Ender's Shadow left off. The children have returned to earth and are trying to restart their lives. From this introduction the book would seem to be a highly boring tale of a bunch of kids trying to get along in life. But Card takes it farther then that. He writes in such a way that you feel a sort of connection with the characters.
	
Card makes this connection easy for the reader. They don't think like you would expect a normal kid too, largely because they are geniuses. They think on an adult level yet their motives are that of a child their age. This combination makes the characters very intricate. It also draws you in as a reader.

	You are able to sympathize with Bean as he struggles against Achilles because his motives are pure. You can see his frustration and his happiness. The fact that the reader is able to connect with the characters is what makes it a good book. Otherwise it's as if you are just along for the ride. But if you feel connected to the characters then the book becomes more then a ride, it becomes a story.
	
As good as the book is, there are still some parts that are a turn off. If you don't appreciate politics then the chances of you enjoying the book are severely diminished. It is vital for at least some of the other books in the series to be read before this one. Otherwise you are left highly confused and it takes away from the book in a big way.

	So if you are looking for a book in which you can connect with the characters, I highly recommend this book. But if you are looking for a child's story to read to your kids, then I recommend you looking somewhere else.
