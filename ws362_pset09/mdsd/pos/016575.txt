This book showed up in my life exactly when I needed it most.
If you open the cover it will take you on a journey of the mind and it will lead you as far as your subconscious mind will let you. At the end you will have extensive supply of food for thought and meditation techniques, which you can continuously improve.
The book has a combination of references to the metaphysical beliefs, personal experiences and scientific research in the area of psychology. It is written in a way that is easy to read yet the language is not oversimplified and presents a rather unique structured and grounded approach of the hard-to-grasp concepts.
This could be your missing piece of the puzzle that would enlighten you in many ways and provide answers to questions regarding astral projection, lucid dreaming and out of body experiences.
