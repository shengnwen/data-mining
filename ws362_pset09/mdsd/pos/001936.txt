The poeple who govern are schools should tread this book. As a white student in a basicl ricth white Shool district, I picked this up this summer for my AP English reading asignment.

I have complained about leaks in my school's cellings, and what I thought was the worst computers in the country. But reading this book,, I am shocked to learn that some kids have to sit on tolliets because there arn't enough classrooms. Thhere are large holes cellings. And these schools are basicly black, sitting right next store to white schools with four gymes.

The govermant says that money won't help them. Money buys books. Money keeps good teachers. Money fixes holes in walls. Money pays for labs. It doesn't matter hwo good the princeible.

Kozal shows the savage wrongdoings of our own socity. That this sort of thing should happen is saveage, but that this would be happening in our great country, is even more of a tragidy. What happened to the American Dream?

And how much longer will the next generation have to suffer? 

Kozal presents a heart-moving, emotional, trubleing, and horific vision of the school system. READ IT IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH
