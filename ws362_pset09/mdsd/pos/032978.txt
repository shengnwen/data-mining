Another quirky, clever, emotional ride for over-active minds.....shooting off on many possibilities and plans, but centering around the usual Dickian themes of drug translation, addiction/dependence and the meaning behind life.

It's an impressive read as ever, with the possibilities it presents for the characters within the scenarios.....how much do they know themselves? They don't seem to know until they are presented with their realities.....Palmer Eldritch....an enigma....another simple but advanced lifeform permeating itself through false realities....the hollowness of worlds....the need for a shared reality presents itself...through the hand, the teeth, the eyes... Identity is transcended by this strange lifeform......

Its ideas and its characters grow weaker, but this work is still significant food-thought to chew on, not obvious to digest but it is digestable....and bleak.
