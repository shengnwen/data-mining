Any one chapter of Mark Wiskup's book is worth the price of the whole thing.  The novice will appreciate the first chapter on stage fright; I've been a professional speaker for more than a decade, and I found something useful in every chapter.  Wiskup's chatty style, clear prose, and story-telling ability even make this an enjoyable read.  
My favorite discovery was the Power Sound Bite, which Wiskup calls the PSB.  This is the clear, concise and engaging message we all wish we had at our fingertips when someone asks, "What can you do for me and my business?"  Wiskup shows you how to build a PSB and provides examples of good, mediocre and bad ones.  He also tackles story-telling, which is almost a lost art in some places( even though we all freely admit that we'd much rather listen to a compelling story than a recitation of numbers or business-speak clichés).
If you've ever used the phrase "integrated solutions" and seen people's eyes glaze over, but this book.
If you've ever said that anything was "(fill-in-the-blank)-centric," buy this book.
If you've ever used the clichés "at the end of the day" or the filler word "basically," buy this book and read it before your next presentation, whether it's in front of a large audience or a single decision-maker.
