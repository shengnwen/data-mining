This book is wonderful.  It doesn't say "This food is good so eat it."  Dr. Weil really explains what foods do for you.  He explains the science of food and nourishment.  The book is so interesting.  A wealth of information.  There were so many facts or studies in this book that I was compelled to share with others.  

Another thing I liked about the book is that he isn't pushing anything on you.  He is just laying things out as they are leaving you to make the decisions.  He ends each chapter with what he recommends, but nothing is rigid.  

I highly recommend this book.  I cannot stop telling my friends and family about it.  This is a book everyone should read.  No kidding
