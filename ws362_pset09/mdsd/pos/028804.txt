If you love the Design on a Dime TV show, you'll love this book.  Now I can finally stop and study the rooms from the show, which is hard to do on TV. The book goes beyond what you see on the show with its detailed how-to information, which explains how to do actual projects seen on the show. The show is cool, and so is the book. I was assuming that you have to be young to appreciate the style of the show, but I went home for Mother's Day, and my mom had this book on her coffee table, too. So, I guess the show and the book are aimed not so much at young people as at people with sophisticated tastes. 5 stars!
