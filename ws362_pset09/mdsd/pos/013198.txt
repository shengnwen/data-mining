If you've ever wondered if some of the way out things in Science Fiction books are possible or even plausible, try The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to read this book. (Although if you are a rocket scientist you may pick up on some of the finer points.)  You don't even have to know a lot of physics to enjoy this book but you will have to be interested in physics to get through this book.

	Brian takes the reader to the ends of the universe using a host of fictional characters and amusing anecdotes as he tours the warped and bizarre nature of the quantum world.  By shrinking to the subatomic you find yourself very far from home without even moving.  Curved space, extra dimensions, morphing, and time warps are all drawn back from the realm of Science Fiction and explained in terms of physics using real life situations. 

	If you want to be able to separate Science Fiction from Science Fantasy, this book belongs in your library.  I write in order to inspire young minds to believe in a future of vast possibilities.  Transporter beams and spaceship jumps through wormholes are great entertainment, but I find knowing real science and using it in stories that my readers may someday live out, vastly more engaging.  The real world Brian brings forth is every bit as wonderful and exotic as any fantasy ever written.  Truth really is stranger than fiction.

	The story isn't finished either.  Toward the end of the book, I got the feeling that Brian was trying to explain things even he didn't fully understand.  Does anyone really understand string theory?  (Well, I do, but no one will believe me.)  I like the way he put the technical notes in the back and included a glossary of terms.  The Elegant Universe is a serious effort and a great achievement.  Definitely for the above average brain, I recommend this book to explorers of all ages.
