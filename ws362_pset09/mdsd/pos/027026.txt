I am still in the process of plowing through this book.  Some may find that there is not much new in it.  I think it's a great resource for the Atkins way of life in general.

I am a newly-diagnosed type II diabetic.  There is far more information in this book than I was able to get from the doctor who diagnosed me.  As a matter of fact, that doctor originally suggested that I go on *Slim-Fast* to lose weight--I about fell off my chair.  Most doctors are still mired in the anti-fat, anti-cholesterol hysteria and myths.  The Atkins approach is a breath of fresh air, since it dispels these myths.

So far, from what I have read, I would recommend this book in combination with Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution (which seems to offer more practical day-to-day advice regarding the details of managing diabetes) as your standard diabetes references.

Unfortunately, few doctors out there are managing diabetes with the low-carbohydrate approach.  The guy who diagnosed me immediately wanted to put me on four or five medications, and he actually vowed to talk me into taking a statin drug, even though he acknowledged that that would only mask the symptoms and not get to the underlying cause.

Some people may not like eating low-carb, particularly with its heavy emphasis on animal protein foods.  However, for those like me, who like being carnivorous or omnivorous, you may like being vindicated in your liking to eat meat.
