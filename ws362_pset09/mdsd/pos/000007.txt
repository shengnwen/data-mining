I held off reading this one due to the negative reviewer who claimed it was a series gone seriously downhill.  Some of this serie's books are certainly better than others, and this is one of the best.

I appreciate the character development and the storyline's mystery was very intriguing.  It was not a dead-give-away (pun intended) as to who committed the murder and any reviewer who gives that away ought to be ashamed of themselves and their big mouths.

I also am glad that it did not focus on sex.  I don't like to know what others do (real or imagined people).  It is none of my business and Rita Mae did not harp on any of it, so thank you Rita Mae.

I love this series and want MORE
