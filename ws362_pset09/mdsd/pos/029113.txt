I just returned from my trip to London, and Rick Steves' book was an immense help.

For those unfamiliar with Steves' books, be aware that these guides differ from others.  Steves is not afraid to give his opinion of what to do and what not to do during your travels.  He provides important insights on great museums you HAVE to see (The British Museum) and tourist attractions that you might be disappointed with (i.e., the London Dungeon).  Instead of a generic reference book, imagine a tour guide written by a close friend which gives you tips on the best ways to plan your trip, get around, or even find the least-crowded entrance.  Tips like these can save you a lot of frustrating time and money.

Steves' book excels at providing such information, and also at guiding you through interactive city walks and museum tours.  That way you'll know what to look for, and can shorten or lengthen your stays based on your own personal interests.  

In addition to sights within London, the book also covers possible day trips to Cambridge, Windsor, Bath, and even Paris (but go for more than a day).  If you plan on seeing more in the UK, you'll need another book.  

Steves provides information on hotels and restaurants, but they are hardly complete.  The 30-40 sleeping recommendations range from the ultra-thrifty to ultra-expensive, and Steves seems to do a job of choosing good values.  The same goes for eating establishments.  

Other books (like Eyewitness Guides) have color pictures and more general information, but Steves provides the essential information, hints, and even some entertaining quips.  If you really want to do it right, get two guides, but make sure Steves' is one of them.
