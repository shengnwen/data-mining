I wondered what the hubbabaloo about the Da Vinci Code, so when I received the ARC to review this book, I was eager to start it. I was a little confused with Code book, because I liked the story, but found some of the narrative a little boggling, but this book, the Gospel according to, was amazing complex and simple at the same time. These authors take the reader piece by piece through the Dan Brown book and shows who, what, where, when and whys the book is a failure on so many levels. I highly recommend this book to those who enjoyed the Code or didn't like hte code...either way you'll be enlighted!
