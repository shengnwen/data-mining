Conrad's besetting literary sin was always prolixity. Despite his occasionally brilliant descriptive passages and his ability to pick just the right uncommon word when he needed it, he rarely bothered to compress his writing.  So it oftentimes sprawls.

This shapelessness is the most serious problem with Heart of Darkness. The paragraphs go on forever. The man who tells the story of his journey - Marlow - is criticized by the primary narrator for his many "inconclusive" tales, so Conrad may well have cultivated his seemingly rambling style just to emphasize how difficult it is for Marlow's listeners to understand the point.  If so, I believe that choice was a mistake.

Much in the story is excessively subtle and allusive. Yet Conrad's deep pessimism about human progress and the human "spirit" is unmistakable. The story's secondary theme, that most people "just can't handle the truth" (to quote a Jack Nicholson movie), comes through loud and clear. 

Heart of Darkness is a classic more for what it says than how it says it. What's more, we're far more receptive to Conrad's message today than was the reading public in 1899. The tale's current fame owes a great deal to Apocalypse Now, but readers looking for an adventure novel will be disappointed.
