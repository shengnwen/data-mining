I generally stay away from historical fiction, but Vidal is pretty straight about telling the reader beforehand what is invented and what is fact.
Burr is a pivotal figure in American history but unfortunately he is one whose role is rarely understood beyond the incident with Hamilton and the accusation of his planned western uprising. He was a man who lead a fascinating life, a life of his own choosing. As a result of this, he never "fit" into any group (or political party) and was thus easy prey for political and legal rivals of any stripe. 
He was fond of very few men (but of very many women) and counted such polar opposites as Jefferson and Hamilton among his enemies. Nonetheless, he was able to work with both of them whenever the need arose.
Vidal's book illuminates Burr in a generally positive light and as a result many of our usual heroes become rather more like villains. Personally, I found the character quite believable and actually quite sympathetic. The book is, like all Gore Vidal's work, well written and devoid of pretentiousness. This one I think is his second best work, "Lincoln" being my personal favorite
