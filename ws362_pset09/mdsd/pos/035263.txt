This book ranks among the best in the history of technology and one of the few that specifically addresses software.  Most other histories of technology or computing center on hardware, with some even focusing on a single computer such as the Eniac, the Difference Engine or Apple.  But recognize that hardware commoditizes over time, while good software largely holds its value.  Software creates fortunes but also deeply felt-opinions about quality, and as Lohr demonstrates, a constant stream of innovation.  The book showcases the creators of breakthrough operating systems and applications, and makes clear their contributions to the rise of the computer industry.  It is worthwhile for readers following technology, business, current events and even law and philosophy- the concepts have indeed become major disruptions in the history of ideas
