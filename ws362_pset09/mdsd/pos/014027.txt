I really enjoyed this story; I have always liked baseball, but now have a new appreciation for catchers.  I learned a lot about WWII and submarines that I had never really thought about before.  The story flows well and is fast-paced.  Some of the descriptions do seem a tad repetitive but overall, I would recommend it!
