Love this book for its fresh, original and tasty recipes. We were so impressed with this title that we have subsequently purchased two of her other books. I must say that the photos make a HUGE difference in inspiring me to cook. It just looks so good! 

My only complaint is that sometimes important bits of info are left out such as what size to chop certain ingredients (mince or dice?). Note that many of the recipes include ingredients that less adventurous eaters might not recognize.
