Most people have limited education in the building of the Panama Canal.  The sum total of my knowledge, prior to reading this book, was that Theodore Roosevelt fostered a revolution in the Columbian state of Panama in order to complete the work abandoned by the French.  That disease and pestilence was rife in the region and that American technology and know how carried the day.  Mostly correct, but woefully simplistic.

This book, written by the outstanding author, David McCollough, does an excellent job of tracking the canal project from its inception to completion, a story lasting about 35 years.  The financial and political intrigue accompanying the French effort is captivating.  The change of scenery (but with an equal amount of intrigue) to the American project breathes fresh life into the story.  And what a story it is.  It would be easy to attribute the ultimate success to superior American ingenuity and resolve, however, while this did indeed play a part, the impact of a national, government financed effort (as opposed to the privately financed French effort) coupled with huge strides in medical and mechanical technology in the intervening years probably was the most compelling reason for American success.  

McCollough, in the course of the book, touches on virtually all aspects of both the French and American experiences, from scandalous  financial dealings, back room political deal making, the strong decisive personalities involved and the social and cultural factors which played such a huge part in the project.

In reading this book, you began to develop an appreciation for the immense scope of the undertaking and the effort required to pull it off. The level of organization required in such an effort is almost mindboggling.  It is difficult to imagine a project of equal magnitude (perhaps the NASA moon landings).  I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history.  It should be required reading in all high schools
