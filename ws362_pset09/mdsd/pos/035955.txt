This book was the favorite book for my young children (now grown) when we 
were preparing for doctor visits. It is still beloved by my retarded son
who is now 31, and I have bought many copies for him through the years. It
covers all the important topics: anticipation (dread), waiting room, routine
exams, and possible shots. All of this is with pictures and words.
