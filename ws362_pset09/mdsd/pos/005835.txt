Awesome Awesome book, I couldn't put it down and I have already started the next one,Count Down. I love the series with Joe, Eve and Jane. I hope you never stop writting them. I have read everyone of them and just wait for the next to come out. I can't put the books down when I start them and I hate when I have to and pick it back up the miniute I have a second to read. Thank you for writting this series, please keep going. I also have 4 freinds reading them too. Thanks so much for your talent as an author. t.cas
