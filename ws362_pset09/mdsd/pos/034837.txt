In "Espresso Tales," the marvelous sequel to "44 Scotland Street," Alexander McCall Smith once again displays his mastery of getting inside his characters' heads, whether they be child or dog, narcissistic macho or crashing bore, a woman feeling the pinch of advancing age or a mother overdoing it in the nurture department.  The story I predict you'll fall in love with is that of Bertie, the precocious youngster who can speak Italian and play the saxophone but hasn't yet mastered crossing streets.  As the episodes switched from character to character, I pounced on the ones dealing with Bertie to see how he was progressing in thwarting his arch-nemesis, his loving mother, who has ensured his place as class freak in the first grade by making him wear pink (make that "crushed strawberry") dungarees to prove his liberation from gender stereotypes.

The novel is character-driven,  but the characters I felt succeeded the least were Pat, the young woman who played the lead role in "44 Scotland Street,"  who, while sweet, is rather bland, and Ramsey Dunbarton, whose tediousness is so well characterized I tended to skip over his boring monologues when I realized that they didn't further the plot.

But these are small complaints.  Even if you haven't had the pleasure of reading "44 Scotland Street," you will enjoy this novel if you love rich depictions of exotic eccentrics; in the end, you will recognize them to be very much like people you know.
