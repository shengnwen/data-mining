Although I thoroughly enjoyed this book, after having read Band of Brothers and watched the miniseries a couple of times, I thought Mr Winters could have devoted more time to his life after or "beyond" the war and included more photos of this period.  Not much light was shed on his post war relationship with Nixon, how he readjusted to civilian life, his marriage and finding that place of peace he promised himself.  Maybe "Hang Tough: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters" would have been a more accurate title.  Having said this I am in awe of him and that whole generation, many of whom sacrificed their tomorrows to save the world for us
