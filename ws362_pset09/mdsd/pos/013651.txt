I first met Robert Friedman at a Drum Away Your Stress workshop in New York.  I actually went more as an observer since I was in the process of leading similar programs.  Robert quickly  realized that I was also a drummer and so we initiated a connection between us which has led to much fun and shared information.  The Healing Power Of The Drum has become my number one resource book.  Last week I led a rhythm circle in a nursing home.  I consulted Robert's little gem and was totally inspired by the research and stories about his work with the elderly and more specifically Alzheimer's patients.  He talks about brainwave study and drummings effects on attention span. Reading his accounts filled me with hands on information and also totally inspired me to working with these magnificent people in a very meaningful way.   Whether it is working with school children, corporate executives or simple community events,Robert's book always has something very useful and motivating for me.  The drum is so much more than I ever imagined it could be.  I used to see it as a musical instrument to have fun with and entertain others.  In actuality it is so much more.  After reading The Healing Power OF The Drum one is left with a sense of how truly sacred this simple hand drum really is.  It's power to communicate, open the heart, summon the divine and heal the inner self is quite miraculous.  Robert Friedman has us discover this truth with writing that is eloquent yet practical.  The book invites you in and once there you can feel the rhythms jumping right off of the pages.  I recommend this book to everyone, since the strongest rhythm in existance,the heartbeat,is inside all of us
