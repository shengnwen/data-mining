This latest effort from Mr. Hannity is as engrossing as his earlier book, "Let Freedom Ring", which I read in 2001. Unfortunately, many of the perils to our way of life pointed out then; still exist today.  

Reading (in this current book) about the misconceptions, mistakes and miscalculations of the holocaust, should make all reasonable people pause and consider our current struggles with enemies just as callous and evil.

Mr. Hannity also deals with the current climate of appeasement.  I have heard him discuss this topic in earlier debates, books, and radio programs.  It is unfortunate to see, in spite of his good intentions, how he is pilloried by others with "hidden agendas."  

This is an excellent book, written by an honorable man in love with our country, people, and way of life.  

All who believe in truth, justice, and the Democratic way; should support his efforts and remember a quote by Mr. Hannity: "While our system allows everyone to question everything:  our enemies wish to replace it with a system that will allow no one to question anything."
