Ms. Duncan-Jones' Introduction is an extraordinary example of scholarship.  To say that the Sonnets have been controversial throughout the time since their publication is a mild understatement.  Ms. Duncan-Jones casts a brilliant and unwavering spotlight on these controversies and resolves them.

Any serious student of Shakespeare must read this Introduction.

If there is a failing in the book, it is in the actual footnotes to the Sonnets themselves.  But in the context of Booth's footnotes, for example, this failing is insignificant.  Anyone who wants a line-by-line exegesis of the Sonnets has many resources available.
