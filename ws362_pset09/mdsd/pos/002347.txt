The American Government gave Charlie's parents a gift of $200 and an injection in their university days.  With their new combined DNA her parents then passed an even more powerful gift onto her when she was born. This made for a very challenging early parenthood with objects that have upset Charlie catching on fire all on her own.  As she gets older her parents with a house full of extinguishes think the challenges are dying down.  Only the American Government agency, Shop, have been keeping tabs on their project and need Charlie and to a lot lesser extent her parents for military supremacy. Of course murdering her mum when they lose track of Charlie's location for a night is a pretty clear signal to Charlie and her father that their welfare is not exactly going to be a big priority when they are captured. Throw in a psychopathic one eyed Indian who enjoys taking lives and power hungry Shop employees and the fact that Charlie is a sensationally written young heroine and the result is King has written a pretty good novel.

Firestarter is not in the masterpiece league of Christine, It or some of the other older King novels but one you won't want to put down until the final pages non the less.
