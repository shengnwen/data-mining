Although book 2 of the highly regarded 4 volume translation of Master Dogen's Shobogenzo is listed as available, unfortunately it is out of print and Amazon advised it cannot be obtained. Nor can I find it anywhere else. The publishers still have books 1, 3 and 4 available. It would be good to see a reprint of book 2 so the whole set was available again.
