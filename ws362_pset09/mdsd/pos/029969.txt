This book caught my eye on the shelf with it's title $30 Dollar Music school. Me being on a budget, and really wanting to put some of my music out there, I gave it a good read. The class was worth more than thirty dollars folks. Not only is the book full of knowledge for the naive musician, but there is an underlying philosophy within its pages. It's the gospel for the underground man. Not only does he give you the tools to get the machine running, he explains routine maintenance, and preventive medicine for it. If you're in a band, or you're an artist that feels ready to unveil your art to the masses, this is a great place to find the roadmap to the goal. I am now in the process of putting it into action, and very pleased with my results so far. If you're real, motivated, and looking for direction, then the road begins on the first page. Buy it! I did and I'm just beginning my journey. Check out my preliminary results at http://www.matthewbuchanan.co
