This book addresses all of us that are new to literary theory but want to bring light to the matter. It covers main stream ideas such as liberal humanism, structuralism, psychoanalytic  criticism, cultural materialism and even a hint of what stylistics is all about. Its goal is ambitious and in many respects it delivers too broad of an overview. However, Beginning  Theory is a surprinsingly easy reading and a good intro to the above mentioned concepts. Each chapter offers a summary of key elements and terms as well as questions and useful pinpointers for further reading thus making reading a dynamic and stimulating experience
