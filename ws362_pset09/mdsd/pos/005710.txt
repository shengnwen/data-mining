Globalization has become a defining paradigm in almost all areas of human activity, and literature is no exception. This report from the American Comparative Literature Association shows that analysis of literature on a global scope can provide important insights into cultural differences and similarities. It responds to the common attacks against modern literary studies in drawing connections between the discipline, its literature, and intellectual challenges understanding language and ideas across cultures, and will provide college-level students with important scholarly papers.
