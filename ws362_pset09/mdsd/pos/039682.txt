A unique way of telling the story of the Holocaust. The volumes tell the story of a father who was in a camp, and a son who felt he must tell what it meant. The books mean a lot to me because the Holocaust is the most horrific event in Western history. Buy these books and weep over the story of the sin behind the horror for the sin still haunts the halls of Western history
