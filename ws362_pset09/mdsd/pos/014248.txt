I am a Corporate Trainer &amp; am always in search of a poignant story and the like to add to a presentation. Although this book is well organized &amp; quite extensive most every quote is directed to the Christian perspective. The book is one of the best that I have seen with this type of subject matter, but I will not be able to use it in my profession because of the religious content. I have in fact passed this book on to my sister whom is involved in Christian Retreats and is a speaker at those events.  I also showed the book to my pastor and he will be ordering one shortly. Well organized, extensive on the subject matter and excellent stories abound inside.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for this type of materiel
