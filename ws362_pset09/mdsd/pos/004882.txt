Natalie Caldwell, an attractive young attorney, is found in the Boston Harbor--presumably the seventh victim of the serial killer known as Little Jack, except she wasn't a prostitute like the first six. Scott Finn, an up-and-coming attorney at the same highbrow law firm, was her former lover and still her good friend. Boston police Lieutenant Linda Flaherty is the lead investigator in the Little Jack killings that includes the Caldwell murder.

Little Jack is arrested but claims he didn't kill Natalie. Finn knew she was seeing an older man and gave Flaherty a list of possible suspects that included high-ups in local, state and federal government. However, Finn is also a prime suspect. Finn was assigned to take over the high profile lawsuit Natalie had been working on and soon discovered why she was murdered. Soon, he's in deep do-do. Will he survive?

Bravo to this first-time author...great story with action, suspense and surprises.
