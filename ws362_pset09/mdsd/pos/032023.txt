I purchased the DVD and the book.  I am returning the book because it does not match the content of the DVD.  Instead of better explaining the exercises in the book, the DVD spends the whole second half doing a power point presentation on Energy Psychology.  This book and DVD have nothing to do with each other.

The DVD states that the techniques are different from EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), but they are basically the same.  It seems to have become a trend in this area to state that your techniques are different than Gary Craigs or Roger Callahan just so you can sell products using the same principles with a twist
