I think it goes without saying that pretty much everyone who has a pet dog love's their dog and is convinced their dog loves them.  But let's be honest.  Most of us are pretty ignorant when it comes to really understanding dogs (and certainly in my case, many other things).  So while it is true that you don't have to have great knowledge and understanding in order to love some other being, including your pet, you can certainly enhance and nurture any relationship through better knowledge and understanding.  And that is what this book can do for anyone who wants to have their relationship with their animal companion to be the best it can possibly be.  Not only is this book a great source of information and knowledge for understanding the emotional bonds we have with out 'best friends' and how to make the most of those bonds, it has riveting true stories that tie in beautifully with the different emotions we see and experience.  When you combine this book with Dr. McConnell's earlier book "The Other End of The Leash" you will have perhaps the most comprehensive understanding of your dog and your relationship with your dog that is in print today.  And a fun read too.
