I bought this book at a used book store when I was 11 years old.  It was very comprehensive but still very easy to use and easy to understand. It covered everything from the most basic information to the more advanced and noteworthy details.  Unfortunately when my mom found the book I was forced to give it up, but 9 years later I still remember most of what I learned from this book.  I'm so thankful I finally found it, I'll never give it up again!  This is a must have manual - pun intende
