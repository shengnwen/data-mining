I am astounded at the negative reviews of this book!  I found this to be one of my most enjoyable reads in recent memory.  The reader must step out of the box a bit to appreciate the quirkiness of this novel, but the task is worthy of the effort.  It's highly original and the plot, while not mired in reality, is well developed.  Is everyone in this book dysfunctional?  Maybe, but those who can't occassionally see themselves here and there in these pages are in denial. If you prefer to think in black and white, this may not be for you.  Appreciate alternative lit?  Check it out, you won't be disappointed..
