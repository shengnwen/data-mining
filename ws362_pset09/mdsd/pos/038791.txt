Some of my earliest memories are filled with reading The Far Side on my father's lap after the evening meal.  Whenever I asked my parents for a one of the standard collections, they told me to wait, one day they would all be in one book.  Then, for Christmas one year, I got this book.

What can I say, but thank you Mom and Dad and thank you Mr. Larson!  The Far Side was, and still is, funny, original, and timeless.  This collection gives you some of the best of the original strips and lends itself well to watching the progression of humor up and through until the end
