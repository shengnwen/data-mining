I was very excited when I knew this author would take the series into the present. For the most part this seems very accurate and as good as the Warrior Breed series that dealt with Vietnam. I am hoping he continues with the GWOT (still focusing on Afghanistan and Iraq). I was kind of surprised on one of the major details (at least I felt) in the weapons choice, primarily the MP5, which seems to be a weapon that is only used in CQB and then rarely. I was kind of disappointed by this minor detail.
