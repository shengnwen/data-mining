Novels are one of the most difficult genres to market, aside from poetry: it requires extra attention to a query letter to create an irresistible pique for an agent or editor's attention - and that's where Blythe Camenson & Marshall Cook 's Give 'em What They Want; The Right Way To Pitch Your Novel To Editors And Agents comes in. Query letters, synopses and outlines are all revealed in chapters which discuss the anatomy of a pitch, a submission package's impact, and tips for handling the pitch to maximum advantage. Plenty of examples make it easy to understand why one novel would be chosen over another solely on the pitch.
