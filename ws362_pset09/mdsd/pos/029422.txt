Dickens has done it again with this wonderful book about the life of Louisa, a girl who lives with heavy sorrow, thanks to her oppresive father who wants her to learn nothing but facts.

This book has wonderful and witty humor, intense drama and downright fun. Dickens does a wondeful job of exposing the cold industrial way of life. 

I loved it, and would recomend it to all who love Dickens, and who just love reading.

Fun and witty. Exciting and intense.

Hard Times is a GREAT read!
