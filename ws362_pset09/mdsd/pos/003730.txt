Kinsey Millhone, former cop turned PI, is back on a case when an expensively dressed woman hires her..money upfront, to locate her missing sister, Elaine, who was seen leaving her local apartment to fly to her summer retreat in Boca, but hasn't been seen since. As Elaine was wearing a $12,000 lynx coat and hat when she left, she'd be difficult to miss, so Kinsey flies to Florida to try to pick up her trail. Elaine's disappearance coincides with a murder/arson case in the building next to hers, so Kinsey enlists the willing help of an almost crippled but very mentally alert old lady, a neighbour of Elaine's in her apartment building, to point her in the right direction towards solving the case. I thought I was pretty smart and thought that I'd worked it all out, halfway through the book, but..no..there was a twist to the tale and a bucket full of red herrings to lead the reader astray. I always enjoy the Kinsey Millhone stories as she's not too gorgeous, not too clever, just persistent and methodical
