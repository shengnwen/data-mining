All the reviewers here who complain about this book's lack of a real plot are missing the point. STORY OF MY LIFE is a character observation in the purest sense. McInerney plops us down into Allison Poole's world with remarkable ease; we see the world through her eyes, but are thankfully spared any "oh woe is me" tirades so typical of fictional female narration. Allison knows what she wants and she goes after it, and the deeper reasons for her self-destructive life in the fast lane are only hinted at, as if she herself was shutting them out of her mind. This book doesn't need any explicit plot - we're simply taking a look at the lifestyle of the young, rich, and disillusioned.

The characters in STORY are also more vivid than those in McInerney's landmark BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY, and they're much more likable. The situations ring true to life whether you're the offpsring of posh socialites or not. And even though Allison's tone is breezy and the pace lightning-quick, there are some deep emotions running beneath the surface. Thankfully, McInerney leaves it up to us to make the connections between the characters' actions and their motiviations, eliminating the need for overwraught "emotional" scenes or sentimental treacle. The proof is in the pudding.

STORY OF MY LIFE paints its picture in broad strokes rather than intimate details. It's a refreshing change of pace, and it still holds up as a modern-day cautionary tale 17 years after its original publication. Check it out
