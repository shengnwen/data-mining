i read that short story in my lit class. i loved it. it caused me to read Eva Luna and it is also the reason that i have given this book 4 stars. thats how good And of Clay are we Created. i'm not sure if all the storys are worth it. its very erotic. and i don't remember most of them but i do remember liking quite a few of them. however , the best one  is the last one
