This a great introduction piece to plant aquarium and all should read it. Beginners will benefit immensely with many tips on starting a plant aquarium. Also the photos on the plants were excellent.
However on a critical note the author has given us a limited range of plants as compared to other books. So to claim the book as an encyclopedia is a misnomer. Secondly as an academic it would be nice to admit that one has changed one's opinion in the search for truth. In his previous book[I forgot the title..I've given it away]it was stated dogmatically that snails must be removed indiscriminately but in this book this animal retains some redemptive value as an algae eater. And there are a few more examples where the author apparently has been converted to another view....perhaps of Diana Walstad?
But overall this is still an important contribution to the plant aquarist hobby
