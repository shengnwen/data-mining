I never have used the Tarot to help interpret my dreams before reading this book and I found it to be helpful and unique. I have begun to keep a dream journal and use this book extensively to give me insights I would never have come up with on my own. The questions the author suggests we ask ourselves for the Dream Spreads have made me think about my life in a different way, and have caused me to make many positive changes
