I just found out I am pregnant, so I thought the topic of this book came along at a good time.  Mandy has just found out she's pregnant, broken up with her boyfriend (the father) and sold her business.  She wants to find a stable job with health insurance and take the best care of her baby that she can.  She does land the job...but just barely!  After puking her way through the interview Damien "Demon" Sharpton he decides to hire her.  Now, she just has to avoid him until she's ready to tell him that she's pregnant.

This story is really cute and fun to read.  It is semi-predictable, but in a good way.  The love scenes in here are hot and steamy!  It is a great summer
