I would have rated this book with 5 stars instead of 4 except that it has some factual errors. These are minor though and this book is really a classic on my favourite comedy couple. It tells about each of their films in chronological order. The other books on L&amp;H I recommend are 'The Magic Behind the Movies', 'Mr L and Mr H' and also 'Babe' by John McCabe, and 'Stan' bt Fred Guiles. Also I recommend to everyone who loves funny things to read a novel called 'Rastus Reilly'. It is very naughty but in a nice way and it echoes L&amp;H movies in some ways
