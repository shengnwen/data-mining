Rich in visual and graphical material, calculations, diagrams and drawings of various humans (sex-specific), in scale, in various ergonomic situations...  A mandatory reference tool for the contemporary industrial designer- and in fact one of the very few available on the market today. This book is especially useful to those students who study automotive / transportation design. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars, due to some minor imperfections and flaws
