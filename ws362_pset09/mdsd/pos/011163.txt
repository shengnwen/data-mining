After a long absence, the Beast Master has returned, and it is well worth the wait.  It is another great Beast Master story, with its usual action, suspense and adventure.  This time a new element has been added, romance, and I feel this really spiced up an already good story.  I'd call this a &quot;Must Read&quot; for Norton fans
