The Austere Academy 



	The main characters of this story are Violet, Klaus, Sunny, and Count Olaf. This book part of a series named "A Series of Unfortunate Events". The series is about three rich kids that are left orphans when their parents die in a fire. They are then put to the care of Count Olaf, but quickly left because Cout Olaf was only trying to get the Baudelaire fortune. They are put to the care of several other guardians, but Count Olaf shows up everywhere they go. Fortunately for the orphans they are very persistent and never give up on uncovering Count Olaf's plan. In this book of the series the three children are put in an academy instead pf getting a guardian. At the beginning of the story the children are left in the academy to stay in a very nasty room. The floors are covered with crabs. Then Count Olaf shows up disguised as a P.E. teacher. The children knew that the P.E. teacher was really Count Olaf, but no one believed them. Count Olaf's plan was to get the children as tired as he could so he could kidnap them easily. As a P.E. teacher he made the Baudelaire children run at night and didn't let them stop until the sunrise. Fortunately they had two friends that helped them out they were the Quagmires. The Quagmires disgused themelves as the three Baudelaires and ran at night while the three orphans got to rest.at the end of the book Count Olaf takes the Quagmires instead of the Baudelaires. This book changed the way I Think because it showed me to never give up and preserver even though things don't look very good. It also showed me the value of friendship because the Quagmires risked their lives to help out their friends. I liked this book because it kept me entertained and I didn't get bored when I read it.
