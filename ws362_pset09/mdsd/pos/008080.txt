This is the second book I've purchased on cooking with kids, but I wish I'd purchased this one first. It goes into great detail for a beginner cook (since I was never really taught how to cook, I found the information helpful!), and has lots of recipes. My girls and I look forward to sitting down and picking out what we want to make every week.
Some of the recipes are pretty complicated for my girls, though (8 and 5), and it makes it difficult for them to help me. Also, there's no nutrition information given. But it's been great for bringing us all together, teaching the girls math skills, and getting the girls acquainted with cooking
