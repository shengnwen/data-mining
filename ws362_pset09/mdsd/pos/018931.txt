I have tried many of these recipes and I must say that they are very good and easy to follow.  Being from an Hispanic home, I know that these recipes are real and true to the South Texas culture.  I also like the format, the main entre with dessert. This cookbook is good for novices also, as she explains everything very well. I highly recommend this cookbook.  PS - the Tres Leches cake is wonderful!
