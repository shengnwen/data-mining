Do you like a certain actor?  Look him up.  Like a cetain director?  Look him up.  Want films from a certain decade or wish to know some of the plot before buying it?  Look it up!  This book is FAR from the complex list of Samurai films, but it hits on the major ones and the people who brought them about.  I had a few films I truly enjoyed, such as RoninGai, The Hidden Fortress and Yojimbo to name a few.  But with this book I was able to expand my library to include such titles as Lone Wolf and Cub and Zatoichi.  A must for ANY library on film or Japanese culture
