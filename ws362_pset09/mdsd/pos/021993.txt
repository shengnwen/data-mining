Arguably the largest independent UFO investigative body in history was Don Keyhoe's NICAP. This book is the story of how the CIA infiltrated, and eventually shut down NICAP's operations. There is no denying that  intelligence officers committed this dubious act. Our only question, more  than twenty years after the publication of this book, is 'why?' Those who  know apparently dare not say. But again, there's no denying - and there's  been none - that the CIA did in fact eclipse this controversial  organization from within, even at the expense of it's founder, the author  of this book, and the Grandfather of UFO conspiracy lore
