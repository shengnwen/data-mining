The list of women whose stories appear here read like a who's who of successful women. All are members of the Macko and Rubin "New Girls Club." MIDLIFE CRISIS AT 30: HOW THE STAKES HAVE CHANGED FOR A NEW GENERATION--AND WHAT TO TO ABOUT IT  is the result of much research and countless interviews with women who changed their lives and are happy that they have done so. 
 
This book is a Godsend for 30 something business women who feel slightly out of sync or unhappy but not quite sure why. They will gain insight from the shared wisdom of the women who were interviewed. The women here were, and are, gutsy and courageous. Some walked away from weddings, others walked away from lucrative paying jobs to take chances and fulfill their dreams. Somewhere along the way, they realized that having it all is not necessarily the key to happiness or success. 
 
The first part of MIDLIFE CRISE AT 30 addresses trends, statistics and labels so I skimmed through that very quickly. However, as I continued reading these inspiring confessions and stories I found myself going back to read the first portion of the book to get the hard data on this complex issue. 
 
This is an important book. Authors Lia Macko and Kerry Rubin, both media  producers have done a great service for women in their thirty's who need guidance, advice and a little help from friends.  
 
Highly recommended for 30 something's and boomers like me who wonder if they made the right choice.
