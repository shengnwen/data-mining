This was interesting coming from Ann Martin, Queen of All Happiness. I used to read the BSC religiously, but now looking back on the books, I think this one was one of the better. I mean, most have absolutely no plot,  and are totally unrealistic, but this one is a pretty good example of a  breakup. I don't think it's quite completely what a breakup is, but coming  from Ann, this is a better one
