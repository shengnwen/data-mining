When Chaz Perrone throws his wife Joey overboard during their anniversary cruise, he thought he had it all figured out.  Hot looks and great legs not-with-standing, Joey was positioned to ruin it all.  But as Dr. Chaz Perrone's luck would have it, Joey doesn't even have the courtesy to die...instead, the formerly expert swimmer manages to keep her head above water, literally, thanks to a floating bale of marijuana and a hot ex-cop named Mick Stranahan.  When Joey comes to on Mick's deserted island, her eyes are swollen shut, she aches all over, but mostly she is furious.  At herself, for marrying a toad like Chaz...and at Chaz, for having the audacity to toss her from a luxury cruiseliner.  Whatever did she do to deserve such treatment?  Joey is determined to find out.....
What follows is a deliciously wild romp through the swampy waterways of South Florida...where Joey is determined to get revenge on Chaz, Mick would like to get Joey, and Chaz is determined to emerge unscathed and rich as hell, doctorate credentials intact.  But Chaz's other head tends to land him in trouble, and when he falls from favor with his rich benefactor and his women on the side, he finds himself on the run....complete with a CroMagnon babysitter.  A glorious story of karma....readers everywhere will sigh with satisfaction at the ending.
