I've read thousands of novels that I cannot remember clearly, and this is one that has stayed with me for more than 20 years.  I have thought of it repeatedly the last few months while walking in the woods and observing how the trails change with the seasons (a crucial part of the plot) and thinking about what life would be like if we were cut off from civilization the way the main character in this book is.  The theme of this book is as beautifully executed as a classic opera and is especially meaningful if you are a music lover.  I'm delighted to know that the book is still in print so that I can easily reread it and give it as a gift to people important to me
