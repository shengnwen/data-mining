I bought this book for the sake of research without a referal.Not only was it a wealth of facts, its operational premise, which could be stated as "the brain studying the brain" has to be both medicinal and evolutionary. I have had great insight and fun with the observations of lizard brain versus mammalian brain. 
Neural, social, enviromental,anthropological,modern, ancient,philosophic, profound and chatty, it is good to have a whole brain that insists on healing itself it the sane context of getting at the meaning of life."Emotions existed before we did" is past brilliant. Thank you Orstein for thinking outloud
