Heard FOR LOVE OF THE GAME by Michael Sahara,
a posthumously published baseball novel by the Pulitzer Prize
winning author of THE KILLING ANGELS . . . you might have
to dig some to find it, but your search will be worth the 
effort.

This is a short, surprisingly moving tale of an aging baseball
superstar who is pitching the last game of the season . . . through
a series of flashbacks, you learn about his career and the
one woman he loves (but who is leaving him).

The writing is compelling, and it makes you feel that you
really get to know the guy . . . plus, it has you rooting for
his every pitch and caring about what happens to him.

There's a great ending, too.
