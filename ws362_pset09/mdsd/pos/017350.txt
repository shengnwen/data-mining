I had never made the connection between my emotions and my eating until I started reading this book.  After tolerating abuse from my parents and my husband, I had no idea why I seemed so nice and happy on the outside but one little thing could make me lose it and throw a temper tantrum.  By doing the exercises in this book, I began to see how I had been keeping my emotions stuffed and as I released them, I also released the weight.  Great book.  I highly recommend it for emotional eaters.
