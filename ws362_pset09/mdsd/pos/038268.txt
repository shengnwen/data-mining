Wolksy dives straight into the nuts and bolts.  From capturing footage, to editing it, to outputting it, and to working with Final Cut Pro's new multicam functions, "Final Cut Pro 5 Editing Essentials" rockets you through the basics.  After tackling all the technicalities of titles, transitions and sound, Wolsky pauses for a moment to discuss the creative editing process.  He covers the rhythm of cutting, the dangers of cutting too much, the Rule of the Line, and the different demands when cutting dialogue, documentaries and music videos.   The book includes 8 real-world lessons, including a multicamera shoot, Japanese kabuki, and a scene from an indie feature starring Hilary Swank.  Cutting footage of a two-time Academy Award winner?  Now that's a nice tutorial.
