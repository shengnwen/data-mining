For an intermediate Taijiquan practitioner or teacher of the art, this book is a must.
Dr. Yang, Ywing-Ming carefully and elegantly writes a most profound treatise on Taijiquan.  His years of experience come through clearly in the way that he is able to describe the use of internal power and leverage which makes Taiji such an awesome health and self defense art. 

In this book, Dr. Yang has made a perfect reference document for disciplined Taijiquan practice that holds true to the martial, health, and spiritual roots.  This book has an outline format that almost any Taijiquan teacher could use to supplement his or her class. Presented in English, followed by Chinese, the book stands alone as a dynamic bridge between cultures and hundreds of years of Taijiquan history.

Beware though, the depth and wealth of knowledge contained within the pages of this work may overwhelm the general Taijiquan practitioner.  But for the brave of heart who wants to explore how deep the rabbit hole goes in Taijiquan, this books serves as a perfect lantern.
