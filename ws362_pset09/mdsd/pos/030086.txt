I have made several of the patterns in this book.  Sure, there are a few strange patterns, like the fingerless gloves and arm warmers, but there are so many others that are really creative and fun.  The petal Bib with it's short row technique is ingenious.  And the felted projects are great!  I've made the clutch 3 times. 

My only complaint is that some of the patterns described as quick and easy--are not so easy, and would be too difficult for a beginner
