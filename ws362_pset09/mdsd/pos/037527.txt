The wedding in the title reunites a group of high school friends after many years. The characters are well developed, making for an interesting cast, and as their individual stories gradually unfold, it becomes apparent that none of their lives are as they seem ... and the reader takes on the role of a fly on the wall observing the dynamics between them. 
For me, this book brought on a wave of nostalgia for the friends I'd lost touch with, but also made me wonder how much I DON'T know about the people in my life today. 
An absorbing read.
