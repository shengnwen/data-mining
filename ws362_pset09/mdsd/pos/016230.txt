I am very new at the investing game, and pretty much know what your average couch potato does...
I found this book to be very interesting and easy to read.  Peter Lynch seems very down to earth and humorous and his tips are pretty basic and easy to follow. 
Considering the topic (which I assumed would put me to sleep like the History Channel!) I was quite surprised when I found I couldn't put it down.  
I would recommend it to anyone w/ a basic interest in investing
