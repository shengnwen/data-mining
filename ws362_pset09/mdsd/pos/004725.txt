This magnificent tale of survival will leave you undone!
I believe Wally Lamb loves his characters in such generous and endearing proportions that we just love them with him.
Dolores Price has a fiery tongue, a well of fury and fear, and the soul of a broken kid whose innocence and dreams have been stolen. 
Raw, warm hearted, passionately detailed and blessed with a life of its own.
Dolores will remain with you, just as fondly as Roberta and Thayer. They are true survivors and their story is a universe so beautifully woven it will have you wanting more, literally craving. A true to life debut.
