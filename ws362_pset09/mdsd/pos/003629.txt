Michael Crichton is known by most, and reviled by some, as an ardent crusader warning of the excesses of unrestrained science; a skeptic of the contemporary juggernaut---global warming.
In this book, Crichton eschews science to whip up a fictional adaptation of the crime of a century: The Great Train Robbery.
This book details the genesis to the execution of this daring theft by Edward Pierce, the socialite and criminal: from Pierce's hiring of the best criminal minds to the long periods of observation. All this done on a background which showed the ever-widening chasm between haves and haves-not.
Crichton's writing is short and precise, with most chapters hardly running over fives pages. This works well as the novel moves along individual events. The milieu of the times also provides for a greater appreciation of the act, as does his penchant to fast forward from the story to the future.
Even though there weren't many explicit passages on science, his description of Bernoulli's Law was simple and accurate. Science has really advanced since those times.
The Robbery suffers from some flaws. It lacks strong characters to back up Pierce.
Miriam and Mr. Harranby, two people essential to the story, are virtually nonexistent. Also, the trial pales in comparison to the rest of the book. Pierce's nonchalance irritates, while the Houdini act at the end is hard to swallow.
Finally, while I agree that crime might indeed pay and that most criminals are of superior intelligence, I believe Crichton undermines his point that poverty is not a source of crime. Focussing on the blue collar crime which this robbery was, we see that all of Pierce's partners were from the lower echelon of society. What does that say of his thesis?

But by far this is a wonderful read. Pick up the Great Train Robbery and have your attention stolen
