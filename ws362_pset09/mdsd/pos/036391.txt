Writing: A

I liked Brian Azzarello's writing in 100 Bullets at first, but after a story that's gone on many years without resolution, had my doubts about this new book. 100 bullets is like the X-files - the individual self-contained stories are satisfying, but there's a bigger story at hand that develops at a snail's pace and really gets annoying because it's never resolved and eventually becomes so overly complicated that you can't understand it anymore.

Fortunately, Loveless works well as a self-contained graphic novel. Azzarello has also stated that it will only run 50 issues or so (or 10 trade paperbacks), so hopefully this title won't run into the same problem that 100 bullets has. The story is intriguing, but the book still works in an episodic manner, and I love forward to the next trade paperback when it comes out.

Art: A+

Marcelo Frusin is the best thing about Loveless. I loved his work in Hellblazer, and have missed him sorely. He is probably one of most cinematic comic book artists of all time. His linework is simple yet elegant, and incredibly expressive. His layout is clear and smooth. I agree with other reviewers that the flashbacks could have been more obvious (sometimes a flashback is obvious from the beginning, sometimes you have to read it twice), but I did appreciate it's innovativeness.

Patricia Mulvihill, the colorist, deserves special mention. Although Frusin's pencils and inks are beautiful, the final work wouldn't be as breathtaking as it is without her gorgeous coloring work. She has a cinematography's eye when it comes to choosing the colors to complement the story and art, and creates a great mood for the story.

Overall, a great beginning, and given that it's relatively inexpensive trade paperback, it is definitely worth picking up
