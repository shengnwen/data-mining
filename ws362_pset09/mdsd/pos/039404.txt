In Silent Killers, Dr. Crosby hits home on the central issue of modern christianity - legalism. In it, he does an outstanding job of explaining the real truth of the gospel of Christ.

This book brings alive the truth of Paul's teaching; which focuses on living life in harmony with the Holy Spirit, and has nothing to do with following any set of religious rules. The leading of the Holy Spirit, and the life of Christ in you is the fulfillment of the law; and we are no longer bound to live under the weight of perfect adherence to a legal code.

We are freed from the burden of the law; and so are freed to walk joyfully in Christ - and fulfill the law from the inside - not from the outside.

A definite must read!!
