I was educated as a biochemist and worked in the pharmaceutical doing medical research at one time.  What always amazed me about hospitals is that they didn't pay very much attention to the importance of good food in a similar way that the food industry doesn't always seem to pay attention to food's relation to health.  This book illuminates some important principles of eating that are reasonable, realistic to follow and not necessarily widely known.  This is a good thing in a world where this topic is often neglected.

While I think the book could have been organized better, the content is useful and there is a lot of good information packed into its 280 pages including some interesting healing stories and recipes.

I particularly liked Dr. Weil's survey of various diets from around the world.  He took the nutritional concepts developed in the book and applied them to each diet.  This made the book much more interesting to me.  I also found the information on losing weight practical without being overwhelming or preachy.

While I don't think that everything Dr. Weil says is necessarily the final word on nutrition, I do think he presents many worthwhile guidelines.  It will remain to be seen whether or not some of his more controversial ideas are born out by further research.
