www.absoutelyunderstandguitar.com ... I bought that course after watching it, I understood the books.

I owned these books for 4 years. They collected dust on the shelf because they were too hard to follow. I bought these books because my guitar teacher (at the time) suggested I buy them for him to teach me theory. I realized the classes were going no where fast and costing me too much money, so I quit before we even got off the first chapter of the Chord book (never touched the scales)

Well recently I came across the 32 hour DVD courses from www.absolutelyunderstandguitar.com ... all I can say is WOW!

Get the course if you can. Don't waste your money on guitar teachers. You get 32 hours of a teacher (who really knows his #$%#) teaching you theory. The lessons flow together. I retained all the information. He made theory very easy to learn.

After I finished the 32 hours, I went back to the Everything about Scales and Everything about Chords books. They're great books now that I understand what he's talking about
