     This is an excellent novel by Stephen King.  Fast-paced, suspenseful, an d chilling all are words that could be used to describe this story.  King does a good job in setting the mood of desperation but determination on the part of its protagonist, Paul Sheldon.  I love how King puts his characters through their paces without them becoming cartoon-like or boring.  Very unpredictable story and thought provoking.  This is a good read
