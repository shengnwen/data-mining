I really looked forward to Ken's story because he was very likeable and intriuging in Jack's book.  But I kinda felt like the author changed Ken in this book he wasn't the same guy he was in the previous novel.  I know that he was under the influence of the extreme feelings for Mari, so he was bound to be a little intense but he seemed like a totally different character to me.  

The molestation of the girls didn't really bother me because I kind of thought that was given considering the enviroment they were raised and the person in charge of that environment being who he was.  I thought the action was good and I'm glad we got to see Jack and the other ghost walkers.  I felt like the reunion between Briony and Mari was a bit of a let down as well as Mari's actions at the end. I also felt that Ken didn't have any of his issues about his father resolved by the end of the story.

I might seem like I didn't really like it but I do and I recommend reading it and the future novels in this series.
