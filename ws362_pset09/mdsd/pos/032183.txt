The book is so engaging one reads it almost breathlessly.  The historical context and the diversity of characters makes it lots of fun.  I disagree with the previous reviewer that Montalban's discussion of our hero's culinary knowledge and talents detracts from the book -- on the contrary, all discussions of food and wine are fascinating and delicious. Warning: do not read on a empty stomach
