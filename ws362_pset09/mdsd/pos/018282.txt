The organization of The Family Table by occasion - family meals, entertaining, holidays - and the author's personal anecdotes make this cookbook delightful both to read and to use. Emphasis is on the pleasure of meals in the company of family and friends, and the recipes range from simple meatloaf to sparkling &quot;special occasion&quot; desserts.  Wine notes provide useful and down-to-earth suggestions for meal accompaniments.  Look carefully at the book's design, too - appropriate table linens have been used as backgrounds for each section, from lace to checked picnic cloths. Novice and expert cooks alike will want to add The Family Table to their collection of cookbooks
