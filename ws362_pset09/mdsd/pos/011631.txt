It's hard to imagine an author covering the 1800 election, the Marbury v. Madison Supreme Court decision, and several other topics that this book treats and coming up with something coherent. But Ackerman does just that. I came to this book after reading another book by the same author dealing with the nomination, election, and assassination of James Garfield ("Dark Horse," reviewed by me earlier) and I am impressed by Ackerman's ability to write a book on political history that is almost impossible to put down. He puts in all sorts of information that is essential for a modern reader to follow the happenings of a different era with understanding, while never letting his writing become too tedious.

The Constitution was not written with an eye toward the political party system that soon developed, and the constitutional mechanism for election of the Presidency soon developed obvious flaws as soon as Washington retired. Ackerman does not go much into the 1796 election, which already unmasked problems (leading to a President and Vice-President of opposite parties) but begins with the 1800 election, which almost led to a total breakdown. 

The main thrust of the book is that out of this election and the ensuing competition between Federalist ideas of the Constitution (exemplified by John Marshall in the Chief Justiceship) and the ideas of Jefferson and his allies (especially James Madison) came a synthesis which has lasted. And I think that to a large extent he makes his case.

I do want to say that another reviewer's comment that Ackerman overly adulates Jefferson and denigrates Marshall does not appear to me to be the case. He points out errors made by both men, though he says at one point that a selfish action made by Jefferson as President of the Senate probably had consequences that were in the nation's best interest, and that may be what the reviewer had in mind. I think the book is actually rather balanced.
