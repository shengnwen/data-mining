Carefully weaving personal anecdotes with social commentary and the occasional study or survey, Carroll constructs a reasonably persuasive argument that might be summed up as follows: Unfulfilled, world-weary young adults are returning to christianity where it is exercised in demanding, sacrificial, incarnational, and liturgical ways.

Carroll shares some interesting interviews, offers surprisingly insightful analysis, poignant quotes, and surveys a wide range of traditions. There are some real nuggets of wisdom here, for example Carroll writes:

"Many young adults find traditional religion intriguing and fellowship groups appealing but ultimately reject the accountability and discipline they require. Like the Generation Xers who avoid marriage while pining for stable committed relationships, young adults attracted to orthodoxy often feel conflicted when faced with its demands. What often makes the difference between flirtation and a commitment is the personal witness of an individual or community that makes Christian virtues seem irresistible-and worth the work."

All of that said, a few problems: 

1) At 320 pages, this was just too long. Personal anecdotes are interesting and useful, but there are simply too many.

2) This looked, felt, and smelled like an inspirational read. But at the end, I wasn't particularly roused. Carroll tried so hard to present the material objectively that the text was dried out more than I prefer.

Despite those issues, this is definitely worth a look, especially given how few writers have addressed this subject. Recommended
