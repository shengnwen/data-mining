I loved her first book, Through A Glass Darkly, I read it at least four more times!!  Her sequel, Now Face to Face, was closure to the first, but not as exciting or sad.  I cried every time I read the first one!  Dark Angels deals with the young Alice, the grand old grandmother in Through A Glass Darkly.  She's just as feisy and clever in this prequel, but I still liked Through A Glass Darkly the best out of the three.  If you want to read any of the books by this author, I suggest you start with that one
