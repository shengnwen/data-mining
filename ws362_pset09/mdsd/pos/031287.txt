Any book on history has to be treated with caution. You can read a thousand books and still wind up with a distorted view. We'll never know the hidden truth of past events. Moreover, Stalin himself made efforts to cover his tracks. Many records were destroyed. Others were altered and fabricated. That said, this is a well-written book that will acquaint you with some of the basic facts of Soviet history. Some famous historical events are covered -- the NEP, the five year plans, forced collectivization, the terror, the Soviet German pact, and others. People talk about Stalin the monster and his crimes. Here you can find out some of the details of what those crimes were exactly. One part of the book that was especially gruesome were scenes of condemmed Bolsheviks in their prison cells begging Stalin for their lives to be spared. It is amazing that to this day there are still those who apologize for Stalin or claim these things never happened. On the whole I recommend this book
