I read this book to my class today.  I thought they would enjoy it but I had no idea it would such a big hit!  The children loved the story and illustrations.  The story is cute and becomes predictable, encouraging children to join in.  The detailed, quirky illustrations brought lots of laughter.  I left the book out afterward for the children to read.  It was wonderful to watch their facial expressions as they read the book silently.  I borrowed this book from the library but will be ordering one of my own right away.  Don't miss this one
