This book about a killer car is the best Stephen King book I have ever read. I loved the movie too (though at some points it did stray a bit far from the book, and infact it removed the whole ghost plot and changed the ending and a remake would not hurt). If you have not seen it, I will not spoil anything more than what I have already written. Give this great read a try
