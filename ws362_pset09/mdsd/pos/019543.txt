I was advised to follow Jeff Galloway by my doctor after a running-related injury earlier this year. I borrowed the book from the local library, thinking I would browse thru it and return it. By the time I read the first 20-something pages, I was convinced I wanted to own this book.

This book has great coverage of everything from climatic condition tips, to age-specific recommendations, pacing to racing, interesting anecdotes to scientific analysis of how your body behaves in response to stress and rest.

A must-have for anybody contemplating running as an exercise or as a racer.
