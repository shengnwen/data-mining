This is a masterpiece. Believe it or not, in some ways I found it more invigorating than Pilgrim's Progress. Mainly because the conclusion and progression of the tale were slightly less obvious.

Bunyan masterfully illustrates personalities and the conflict/struggle that is going on.

This is great imaginative fiction with good spiritual application. This would be a great book to go through as a group and study/discuss
