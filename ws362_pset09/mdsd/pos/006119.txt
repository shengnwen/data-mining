Most academics believe it's impossible to write intelligent books in plain language that will grab the interest of lay readers...perhaps this one will change their minds. This short book is a pleasure to read. Author and scholar Howard Gardner addresses a general readership without assuming that his readers have academic experience with psychological theories. This is a rare tome indeed - a book by a Harvard psychology don that is intelligible, elucidating and entertaining. Gardner covers all the elements of how people change their minds and couches an appeal to what he calls the "unschooled" mind. He discusses how minds change, how intelligence works and what factors influence people's thinking. Although he does not provide much tactical advice on applying his principles to be more persuasive, almost everyone can learn something new from this book, which we highly recommend. Not only could you benefit from exploring how to change people's minds, you may even change your own mind about the persuasive approaches you use every day
