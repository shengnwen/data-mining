As I read the new testament books of the bible and study carefully what it says and how to apply it to my life I usually turn to Warren Wiersbe for a great commentary and devotional. 1 Peter can be a bit overwhelming with all the references to submission and to suffering and rejoicing. Weirsbe's comments added clarity and devotional insight to a topic that is hard to grasp without time and repetition on the truth therein. If you are going to be using 1 Peter in group study I would highly recommend this BE HOPEFUL as a valuable resource for all. God Bless You as you study and apply! 4 stars not 5 because i would have liked MORE of it!!
