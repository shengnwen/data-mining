It is not going to work. We now live in a world communtity. Just at the time the entire world is moving into a world communtiy, some (many) in America are trying to move in the other direction - into more isolation. The many forms of nationalism that exist and say that our people are better, more important, smarter than your people are basically evil. All human beings deserve equal treatment as we enter the world community which will eventually treat all persons on the planet earth with respect, care and compassion. The history of nationalism is one of overwhelming evil. One dramatic example of the evils of nationalism is that of Nazi Germany. However, there are many more subtle evils to nationalism that infect this world chronically. Nationalism doesn't have to be an acute infection as in the case of Nazi Germany to do damage.
