This book is about self-love for every woman out there, no matter what size clothes she wears. When self-confident, beautiful Pamela Spencer makes up her mind to do something ~ or in this case to not only do something but to win someone's heart, she does it. After all, Pamela and Reese's grandmother, Fiona, definitely know what kind of woman Reese needs and is really attracted to. And it's not skinny little Sharon!

...When Pamela leaves Reese and files for a divorce, she writes him a letter ..."I'm sorry I played along with Fiona and tricked you into marrying me. But now you'll have your freedom back. Freedom to marry Sharon, like she said you wanted to do. She said you two had always loved each other and that you'd be married now, if not for me."

I don't know how many men who have told me they weren't interested in a stick of bones, but this book illustrates there are many of them out there who are gorgeous, successful, and strong. I don't know a man alive who wouldn't choose Marilyn Monroe over a size '0'.

I enjoyed this author's writing so much that I am requesting my local library look into purchasing some of her books as well as my favorite bookstore keeping some on their shelves. Hopefully, they'll listen. Pat Ballard has a voice that deserves to be heard and listened to.
