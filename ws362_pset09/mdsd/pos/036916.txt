I have to disagree with the other reviews wholeheartedly.  I bought this book in preparation for training my son.  He's my second, so I did manage to train his sister "on my own," but she is a girl and he's a boy, and she's 5 1/2 years older, so it was a looong time ago.  I have always dreaded potty training, but this book's "cheerleading" style has been so helpful and motivational.  We are just at the beginning stages, but this is a great reference.  The section on books, potty chairs and other helps is really great.  This book is helpful to have on hand when your child is around 18 months so that you will be ready to start the preparation and pick up the cues, even though you will not likely start moving forward until the child is closer to 2 or 2 1/2
