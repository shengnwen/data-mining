I almost didn't pick it up because it is from the Luna imprint.  Their books have been real hit and miss for me.  I'm glad I got it because it turned out to be one of the nicest reading surprises I've had this year.

Book revolves around a young women who was due to hang for murder who has her sentence commuted so she can become the food taster for the Commander, the military ruler who overthrew her country's corrupt royal family and set up a utopian, highly socially regimented, dictatorship. She gets pulled into political intrigue on several layers and has to worry about the powerful family of the man she killed, her developing, illegal, magical power and her growing feelings for her boss the Commander's spymaster and assassin.

The book is written like a straight historical novel, not a  fantasy, and although there is magic in the book it is not integral to the plot.  That, and unique, almost socialist, culture that Snyder creates make Poison Study stand out from the huge mounds of blood and thunder, sword and sorcery, pseudo medieval, epic quest fantasy novels out there.  The texture of the book is more like a well done Romance novel than standard Fantasy or SF, and that may turn some people off which is too bad because it is an enjoyable story
