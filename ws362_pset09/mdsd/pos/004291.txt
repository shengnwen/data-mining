This book, written in 1998, takes an objective look at the varieties of religious expression in America at the end of the 20th century and projects the observed trends into the new millennium. This is good information for anyone to have, whether one is a &quot;seeker&quot;, a casual observer, or a devoted follower of a particular religion. It covers the &quot;mix-and-match&quot; religious experiences that are popular in some areas as well as the tradional religions who are embracing new methodology to impact today's society. The influence of religion in the social and political arenas is also addressed quite extensively. One subject the authors glossed over a little too quickly is the impact of televangelism and the effect it has on religious beliefs and practices. For good or for ill, televangelism has a much greater impact, at least in America's heartland, than the authors indicate. Otherwise, this book is very comprehensive and never ceases to be interesting
