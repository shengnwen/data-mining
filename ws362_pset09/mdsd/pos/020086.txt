I've read a few of Hunter's books before. I must say that this one takes the cake by far. The story moved along nicely. The hero/heroine were interesting and had depth. There was a good development of their relationship...they didn't just suddenly realize they were in love overnight. It naturally progressed and their chemistry was great. The plot was interesting as well. The only thing that could've been a little more "steamy" were the love scenes. They were all pretty brief and the first I had to reread because I didn't realize it was happening. Other than that the book is pretty good
