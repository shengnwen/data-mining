When reading this book, you need to throw reality out the door to some extent, but it is still a highly entertaining read.  Three high ranking politicians are assassinated for various reasons, and congressman Michael O'Rourke finds himself in the middle of the mess.  It all goes back to an operation that was blown years back thanks to a politician who couldn't keep his mouth shut.

Most Vince Flynn fans are very familiar with Mitch Rapp, who does not appear in this book.  However, there are a lot of characters here who make appearances in his other novels.  Not required reading if you want to read about Mitch, but still worth the time just the same
