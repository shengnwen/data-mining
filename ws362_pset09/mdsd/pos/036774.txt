I was a bit annoyed by The Eyre Affair but also intriqued about the book jumping and time travel. So I read this sequel and found it to be more fun :) that I am willing to forget my bugs with the first book. The jump can happen from-to a book, between one book to another, sometimes to something that was not a book at all! Just a 3-4 lines of washing instruction could do the trick ;) While the time travel with Next's father was exhilarating.

However, there are some time lapses between the actions that were not fully described/ explained because I found myself wondering why Friday was a long way from Tuesday (well, certainly has not happened in all my days)? It really needed one more day to accomplish what Next was doing, but guess what, later on, there was a dialog indicating that it has been 2 weeks. Well, what do you know. Time 'slipped'? where have the days gone by? @_@

But then, an unexpected twist happened near the end and I was very satisfied by the play that I don't really mind about the missing day(s). I admit the story still needs some polishing but the science fictional thoughts popped in it are too good to be passed by
