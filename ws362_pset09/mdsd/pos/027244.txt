It's hard to like Hugh Farnharm. He drives his wife to alcoholism, turns his son into a mortal enemy, and impregnates the only woman available to that son in the apocolyptic future. He conveniently gets rid of his old family to start a new one with a much younger woman. His son Duke, however, is a good and moral man, despite often being wrong, but he's wishywashy. It's clear that Duke gets shafted, but it's only because he fails to act. There is a time when Hugh tells Duke that his best option might be to shoot Hugh in the back. It's too bad Duke didn't do it. Hugh Farnham deserved it
