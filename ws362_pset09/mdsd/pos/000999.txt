Haunting, and maybe haunted, are words that come to mind when I think back on "Housekeeping".  Thoughtful and beautiful prose, rather than dramatic and exciting action, are hallmarks of Ms. Robinson's writing, so I never really expected "Chucky" to jump out from behind a tree wielding an axe, but given what happened to narrator Ruth's parents, I could never be sure.  Another short classic that "Housekeeping" greatly reminded me of was "Ethan Frome" by Edith Wharton.
