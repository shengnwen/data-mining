Protector is fairly entertaining.  If you're looking for a quick, fun read, or if you want to pursue other Known Space books (especially the Ringworld series), go ahead and pick up Protector.  If you're looking for high drama and/or deep characters that you can care for, Protector probably isn't for you.  One of the things I like about this book, and other Niven books, for that matter, is that *most* of the science is solid.  The descriptions of certain technologies are detailed enough to be intriguing and enjoyable for anyone
