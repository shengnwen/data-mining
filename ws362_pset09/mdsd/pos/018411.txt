Tyler's Accidental Tourist is a very nice and quick read.  While following the escapades of Macon Leary, the hero of our story, the author teaches a gentle lesson about adult interpersonal relationships--the quote is as follows:

"...he began to believe that people could, in fact, be used up--could use each other up, could be of no further help to each other and maybe even do harm to each other.  He began to think that who you are when you're with somebody may matter more than whether you love her."

The book is a little too long, although nicely and thoughtfully written.  The sentence structure varies nicely, and her characters are quirky, believable, and scarily like everyone's goofy side of the family.  I did find myself chuckling out loud at a few of Macon's foibles and eccentricities; and that made this not only a thoughtful but a downright pleasant read as well
