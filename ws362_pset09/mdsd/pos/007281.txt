  Al Capone Does My Shirts is a fiction story about a boy, Matthew Flannegan "Moose" and his family who live on Alcatraz. Moose is faced with many challenges throughout his childhood including having to take care of his older sister, Natalie, who has autism. Whatever the challenge though moose always finds a way to over come it.
 This book is wonderful for all ages- children and adults. I highly recommend this book to people who like to read books that have many adventures.  Gennifer Choldenko is an amazing author and I plan on reading more of her books. IF i loved it you probably will too.
