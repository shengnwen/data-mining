I love huge, exhaustive books like this.  I hate not being able to find the answer to a question in under five minutes, and my library has dozens of books like this that make such searches easy (the internet is another  fast tool, but very few websites have more than the most basic knowledge.)   If you want to learn how to write poetry and learn prosody by hands-on  examples, go read John Hollander's little masterpiece, &quot;Rhyme's  Reason.&quot;  If you want fast biographical and literary references, go  check out &quot;Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia.&quot;  But if you want the  absolute last word on poetic forms and meters, with absolutely thorough  histories of each subject, use this book.  It's saved my critic's keister  more than once in the classroom.  As one of my professors said, a scholar  is not somebody who knows all the answers: a scholar is somebody who knows  how to find all the answers.  This book is an indispensable reference tool  for anybody seriously interested in poetry
