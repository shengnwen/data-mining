Clarissa Pinkola Estes reached a lovely taproot for me with this CD.  I am a chronic insomniac and now I easily drift off to sleep, feeling as warmed as I did when my grandmother used to lie down with me, petting my forehead with her soft, papery hands.  

How simple and brilliant.  We have all read our children to sleep with classic bedtime stories, yet we neglect ourselves completely, forgetting how soothing it is to be read to.  Just told a story.  I'm so glad Dr. Estes thought to do this in her lovely voice
