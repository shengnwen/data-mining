This book makes fascinating reading.  It's mainly done in an encyclopedia style, with entries for many, many people who chose to exhibit their unusual features or talents.  The author obviously feel strongly that they have a right to do so, and shows much caring and respect for them.  I really liked how he followed their lives all the way through if he could find the information, so they were presented as people and not just shows.  

However, I would have really liked a little more context with the listing---more information about sideshows in general and more perspective on the listings.  I did like the sidebars here and there, but it would have been great to read more about life in general for all the performers--what it was like to travel with a sideshow, what the people watching the shows acted like, etc.

I also found the humor inserted in almost every listing a little forced, and not in keeping with the general respectful tone of the book.  There were lots of little puns and silly jokes, which didn't add much and were a distraction.

I found the last section of the book, about present day shows and performers, to not really fit with the rest of the book.  These performers almost all just do odd and bizarre things, as opposed to having odd and bizarre things thrust upon them.  I think it's a very different thing to CHOOSE to be odd and bizarre as opposed to making the best of a life where you already are.

It sounds like I liked this book much less than I did.  I really did find it an interesting and caring survey of a group of people political correctness often prefers not to talk about.  It's ironic that this same attitude probably keeps many people on public assistance, instead of making them extremely rich as many of these performers became
