I bought this book when I was doing my Master's in Economics. Back then it helped me learn a great deal about environmental economics on my own (without a teacher).  It is written in accessible language (not your typical cryptic economics text book), full of examples and honest in the way it presents the information -form this point of view the problem is this way, from that point of view the problem is this other way. 
I now also hold a Master's in Environmental Studies and a PhD in Geography specializing in Energy and Transportation issues.  For the past few years I have returned to it again and again for reference.  While the edition is old (1993), it is still a great basic introduction and has good references for where to go next if you are looking for more depth or a more advanced treatment of the subject.
