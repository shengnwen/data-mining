This book is the memoir of an Italian-American woman's emotional, difficult quest for faith.  Strong themes are family, the death of her father, the supernatural, the Old Country, and miracles.  The story is engrossing and educational with some slight repetition, especially toward the end, that could have been done away with by a skilled editor.  Recommended
