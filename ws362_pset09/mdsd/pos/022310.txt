I have studied Japanese for quite some time, and managed to get a good grasp of basic vocabulary and most sentence patterns, but was at a loss for words when the conversation became the least bit intellectual.  This book  filled in the gap in my Japanese quite nicely.  Most textbooks are geared  at least in part for the tourist, presenting practical, but simplistic  conversations.  If you know that you are going to need to discuss anything  beyond the weather and your health in Japanese, I would strongly recommend  this book
