For about a hundred years we have been measuring intelligence by using standardized tests. At the same time, it was clear that intelligence alone is not a guaranteed measure of how well an individual will do. (The standardized tests that the military uses is statistically well proven to be the best indicator of success in the military.) An indication of the failure of intelligence testing alone is the high percentage of the members of Mensa (the high intelligence club) that are in prison. 

In the past 20 years or so the concept of Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been researched at the National Institute of Mental Health and others. It has become a established as a measure of successful leadership. 

This book fills several needs. First as an introduction to the overall concept. Second it describes the four most common emotional intelligence models and how they relate to each other. Part two of the book covers the fifteen competencies of EI. The third part of the book features forty-six exercies to help build effective emotional skills. These can be used either by individuals for themselves or in formal training situations
