"How to Read a Person Like a Book" is an interesting book about reading a person's body language in order to interpret what they are feeling.  This concept is obviously interesting to all of us as beening able to determine when a person is communicating to you non-verbally has a lot of potential uses.

The book unfortunately is quite old.  While body language is unlikely to change much over the years, the language used is obviously older.  The book does a good job of explaining that you can't just take one signal and immediately translate it into a message, but rather you have to look for groups of signals.

The organization of the book is acceptable, but I wish the formatting were better in order to reference it better.  While the pictures included were good and helpful, I wish there were more of them.  I also wish there were a few pictures in an index in order to practice.

The content of the book however is good and very informative.  I recommend this book.  4 out of 5 stars
