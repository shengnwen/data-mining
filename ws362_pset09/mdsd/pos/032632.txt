A friend of mine recommended this book to me.  At the time it was required reading at West Point and it very well may still be.  No other book displays the history of war in Europe in such a concise and complete way.  It also shows how the nations of Europe developed and what gave them thier defining characteristics.  Anyone with an interest in Western history or military history should own a copy of this book
