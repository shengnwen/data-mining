This book is just perfect.  It's very well written.  Conrad shows an understanding of the predicament of women of his time.  Conrad advances the plot though the voice of the characters, who tell a story, which involves another character telling a story, etc.  At one point the tale is six levels deep; but such is the skill of Conrad that you do not notice and are never lost.  One of Conrad's two or three best.  A book I was sad to end because I was enjoying it so much
