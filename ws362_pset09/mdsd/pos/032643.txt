I've used Words Their Way for the last year and loved the strategies. This particular book gives lots more sorts for spellers in the letter name/ alphabetic spelling stage.  It includes consonant blends and diagraphs as well as more short vowel sorts.  These hands on materials have been a great help to me in teaching my mildly disabled elementary students, but all the regular lower grade teachers at my school are raving, and using these great strategies and materials.
