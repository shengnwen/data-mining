Though it runs the risk of serving everyone and so pleasing no one, this Core Knowledge kindergarten book really is helpful. I've used it as a "spine" to satisfy myself that I haven't left any gaping holes in my daughter's kindergarten education. It seems to have been written more for folks with kids in public school to fill in any gaps; I'm using it from a homeschooler's perspective. It has served its purpose. I don't plan to use the remaining Core Knowledge Series books because I want to pursue a classical education for my kids, but I would recommend this book to those who are as timid as I was starting out with homeschooling and who haven't yet settled on a specific curriculum or direction
