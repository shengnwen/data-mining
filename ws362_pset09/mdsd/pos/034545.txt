I was a counelor for over 20 years and have given this book or recommended this little book often. The author speaks truth in such a simple and kind voice. I've been helped by it and I know it has helped those I've introduced to the book. Grieving is sometimes compared to the dying process discribed by Eliz Kubler Ross. Not true. Grief is so very different. The tiny size of this book makes it perfect for a grieving person who can barely read anything and certainly nothing too complicated. It's simplicity makes it a great book for all people. It can also be read again and again as the grief process continues and the griever goes through many changes which feel unique to them but which are usually very common to all of us who have had cause to grieve
