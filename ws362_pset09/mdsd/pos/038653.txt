I have found the Team Memory Jogger to be very valuable to me. If your organization has many meetings that tend to get very little done, this is a great tool to help your team make the most of their time. The Team Memory Jogger is packed with usefull and helpful tools to help meeting facilitators, team leaders and participants get organized, stay focused and achieve real results
