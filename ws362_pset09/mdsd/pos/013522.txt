This an informative educational book that is very easy to read. My only complaint is that it is tediously repetitious and could be condensed considerably. "Eat Fat Lose Fat" by Enig & Fallon covers much of the same material and much more besides. However, by sticking to just one main topic this book offers more didactic punch to the average layman who doesn't want to be challenged all at once by all the dietary changes suggested by Enig & Fallon. So, start with The Coconut Oil Miracle and then progress on to books by Enig & Fallon
