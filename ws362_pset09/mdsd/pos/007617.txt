This fieldbook is so chalk full of ideas it can be a little overwhelming! But, if one takes their time there is much to be learned. I especially appreciated the icons that Senge uses throughout the book (explained at the start) that help the reader to organize their thoughts and to put the ideas into context. This is definately a fieldbook for the leader of the learning organization--a guide that can be used and referred to over and over again
