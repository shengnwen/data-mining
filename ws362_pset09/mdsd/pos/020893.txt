Even though I have followed the Parelli's method of relationship building with my horses, I am always adding to my knowledge.  I really enjoyed the part where Dr. Miller profiles several different professionals and explains their backgrounds and training methods.  Unfortunatley the old school methods of abuse and torture training are still around, but as more and more people are exposed to this gentle idea, I hope we can redeem ourselves in the eyes of these Regal creatures.
