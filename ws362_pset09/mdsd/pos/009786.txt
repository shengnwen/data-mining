This novel caught me by surprise. I expected chicklit, but what I got instead was a wonderful story of flawed people who come together through true love.  I love how perfectly the author captures the thoughts and worries of women at the begining of a relationship; you understand exactly what kind of risks the characters are taking with their hearts.  The letters Mike sends to the monk back at the monastery really deepend the book as well.  I didn't agree with a word he said, but I appreciated his beautiful way of expressing his thoughts on God.  This novel was so much more than I expected
