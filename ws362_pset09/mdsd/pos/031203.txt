I teach writing and publishing workshops, and this book is a great low-cost addition to offer my students. The author has done a lot of work to supply vital information, including addresses needed in the writing and publishing industry, and to condense the enormous, almost overwhelming amounts of information out there down to the distilled basics. An historical famous author is noted to have said in a long-winded letter to a friend, "I would have written a shorter letter but I didn't have enough time." As a professional writer, I use this book to rescan and stay on top of the basics, where longer books (of which, of course, are also useful in different ways) would not suffice. From the writing "theme" to getting my work copyrighted, it can be easy to get lost in the depths of one or two basics and forget the others. It's a great jump-off point that keeps me organized and on track.
