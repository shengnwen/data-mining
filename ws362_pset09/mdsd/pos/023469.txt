As much as I love the Merry Gentry and Anita Blake series, I truly wish Ms. Hamilton would go back to her debut Novel "NIGHTSEER" and finish what she started. As noted by another reviewer a prequel would be nice, but a few sequels would be even better. There is so much left standing at the end of this novel that I keep watching for her to write a sequel. The abrupt ending makes you think there is already another book out there waiting to be picked up. As much as I enjoyed this book, I really don't believe I would have read it if I had realized ahead of time how unfinished it is. Hopefully Ms. Hamilton will remember and return to her beginnings
