At the risk of simply repeating, at length, the sentiments expressed in earlier reviews, I'll be brief...

This is an amazingly comprehensive work that covers seemingly every facet of professional cooking.  The book is arranged nicely and follows a logical progression.

In buying this book I was looking for something that could speak to cooking technique in such a way as to improve my cooking KNOWLEDGE, vice a simple book of recipes.  This book has unlocked a good deal of creativity in me, in that now that I understand the principles that govern how certain types of food behave, I can get on with making up some of my own stuff.

The only word of caution I can provide is that the recipes inside usually make enough for 10 people.  If you are comfortable with making conversions you will have no problem.

The Bottom Line: If you own no other book about cooking technique covering a broad range of topics, this is the book.
