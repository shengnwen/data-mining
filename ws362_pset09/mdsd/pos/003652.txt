I have a nephew who is having trouble with reading, so I choose a book series and we each read the book.  Then we get together and discuss the book.  If he reads it and truly comprehends it, then he gets to pick a "prize" such as a trip to the zoo or a museum, or a restaurant.  But it's hard to find books that appeal to an 11-12 year old and to his aunt!  This series is great!  It's funny, quick and smart!  And I like the fact that there are strong female characters as well!  It's good for him to see that in literature and in life
