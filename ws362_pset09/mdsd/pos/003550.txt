I read this book, here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.This book is an auto-biography.
This book has very good parts.About World War II, Chuck Yeager tells us that, he had an order to kill massive numbers of defenseless german civilians in last months of World War II, using .50 machine guns.Not a single american pilot refuge to follow that order.Chuck Yeager himself tells us about this reality.
This book is in many times has emotion and good advices.
If you read all my other reviews about auto-biographies, you will see that with just one exception(" The World of Yesterday " by Stephan Zweig), any auto-biography got five stars from me.
This auto-biography is sometimes, with no sincerity.
Chuck Yeager tells that, he was born and grew up in Virginia.
At these times racism/eugenics was law in Virginia and he never tells us nothing about or against racism/eugenics in these times.Well, if he was a racist, he doesn't tells nothing.Well, I think that in these times, he was a racist, but he doesn't tells nothing about this subject.
