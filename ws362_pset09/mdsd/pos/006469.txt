Over a period of days, I read my 7 and 4 year old the stories in this lovely book.  We all just loved them - the stories are such a refreshing change from more modern stories.  They are old-fashioned, but still relevant and engaging to children.  Jenny Linksy is charming, but has her faults.  She admirably faces challenges and is willing to admit when she's wrong.  My kids kept asking questions about the stories and making comments about Jenny and her friends for days after each reading.  They totally looked forward to the next story.  Echoing a prior reviewer's comment - Please publish the rest of the stories
