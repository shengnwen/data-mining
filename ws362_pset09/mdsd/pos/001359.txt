I loved the book, and think the author does a great job of laying out the model and using examples from his reaserch.  Bottom line, you are a result of your thinking and to become an overachiever you got to think differently.  I agree, think normal be a normal person. Think differently be a different person.

Below is a quick sommary of the key takeaways:

1) Think "nada" while performing  
2) Pressure is natural and can be a good thing, so welcome it and allow yourself to enjoy it
3) Be like Yogi - create your own reality and bring others into it
4) Have a dream - something that will drive you fw
5) Burn out, overcommitment will stop you... Be perfectly calibrated.
6) Have healthy commitment, play, enjoy, go with the flow, think about possibility, not risks and rewards

7 ) Become an overachiver 
- One pitch at the time, or being present
- Target shooting, or focusing your energy on the the stuff that matters
- Have a routine - such as golfers before a swing to prepare yourself for the performance
- Effective philosofy - nothing is stopping you!
- etc...

Highly recommended book
