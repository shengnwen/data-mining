I think the story is absolutely top notch, especially because its true. But the book has this major problem, for me at least, in that it seems to teeter on the fence between a history book and a storytale. Factually, I'm, sure its mostly correct, but the problem here is that the author likely writes a lot of history books, because I felt more like I was reading about what happened instead of reading a tale. I'm not suggesting the author fabricate anything, I'm simply suggesting it could have been written much better if it just used the language a competent fiction writer is equipped with.

If you just want the book for the story, then by all means, buy it, cause I believe it is the only decently translated one left in print today
