I learned to cook from a much older version of the joy of cooking. I actually bought this version for my mother for her birthday; I already owned it and she fell in love with mine. This Joy of Cooking has a lot more ethnic foods and some fantastic new explanations. It is bigger but they still had to leave some things out after adding the new information so don't throw out your old Joy of Cooking yet
