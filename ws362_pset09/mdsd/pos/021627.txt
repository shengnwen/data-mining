What little girl didn't love Little House?  OK, most of us--and if we loved it enough, we read them all, all of them exciting and heartwarming, until this one.

In The First Four Years, they don't sing together after the crop fails.

Reading the Little House books as a child, I loved the adventure and the warm family life, and didn't really notice that they were starving (Long Winter) or that large gaps occurred in the narrative whenever something really bad happened (By the Shores of Silver Lake).  Reading them over as an adult, this was a really really depressing tale written by a person trying too hard to be cheerful.  (Not that they don't have their place, for kids--my love of history is surely at least in part a result of loving the Little House books!)

I found The First Four Years positively refreshing in showing how frontier life was difficult and lonely.  Reading biographical (not historical fiction) accounts of LIW's life shows The First Four Years to be a much more honestly written tale, and it still has some characteristic warmth and even humor. But boy was it hard to find some in that life. 

It is really sad to know that after a life of not enough food or a consistent place to live, the author married a prosperous young man from a well-to-do family and lost everything in the next few years, so that she was worse off than ever.  But that's the way life is for some people.


The one star rather than five is merely because the book was not fleshed out enough.  I'm rather glad Rose didn't get her hands on this one, though, as I would not have liked to see the lighter side of diptheria.
