George Peper had a wonderful experience in St. Andrews and, thanks to his low-key, affectionate book about the town and its people, we have one, too.  He captures all things good about St. Andrews and Scotland - the friendliness and decency of the people, the feel of the air, the light on the hills and sea, the feeling of standing at the first tee of the Old Course, and the uncanny sense of being exactly where you want to be.
