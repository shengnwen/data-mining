I am reading these poems and trying to understand their appeal- and they do have appeal. There is a certain rendering of experience , of perception and reflection upon that perception. There is a certain aura of mystical meaning, of something hidden and beyond coming through the world of appearance. There is a certain sense of wonder and of questioning, and of always somehow leaving the reader with that question and with that mystery. There is a unique language of sensual and philosophical words .There is Love and Understanding and Presence and Absence and God. 
I know I have not defined it for anyone , even for myself. And perhaps this is also it, some feeling of some apprehension which does not quite grasp the reality - reality that is escaping us as we apprehend it. 
This is not very helpful I am afraid , and all I can do is suggest the  Rilke poems as far more instructive than anything I have said.
