For a pretty fat bio, I found this a surprisingly easy and swift read. Cronin, who certainly knows the lay of the land, the type of people, and even some of the actual folks Beckett knew, seems a fair and judicious  biographer. I found the book most useful in charting Beckett's development  as an artist from the callow &quot;knowingness&quot; of his early novels  and poems to the wry despair of his mature work. One is impressed both by  Beckett's inconsistent touchiness about the handling of his work by  adapters, and by his quiet generosity with near strangers as well as  friends. Cronin includes plenty of delightful trivia, from quotes (&quot;I  am not a philosopher; one can only speak of what is in front of one and  that is simply a mess&quot;) to the fact that Beckett always accented the  first syllable of Godot
