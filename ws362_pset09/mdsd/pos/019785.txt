I'm just simply amazed by this book and Tom Shinder. I bought after I saw it recommended on the Microsoft site where Shinder seems to be the ISA guy. There is absolutely nothing better, nothing that even comes close even, out there. Shinder knows his stuff. The coverage of EFS, IPSec, and IIS is excellent and I learned some about DMZs too. I dare say there is not a chapter in the book that you wouldn't want to digest completely
