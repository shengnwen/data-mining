Luke Yankee's extraordinary and captivating stories of his life "growing up with Eileen Heckart" are so much fun to read it's hard to put the book down. I laughed and cried as Luke shares some his most intimate moments with his "Mama" with love, humor, and respect. Luke has captured the essence of his mother's deep passion for acting and her deep love for her family. Above all, Eileen Heckart was committed to her family, for that alone, she should be remembered always as a great woman! "Just Outside the Spotlight" is a great read for anyone who loves show business and a must read for anyone who has experienced losing a parent. 

Thank You Luke for this most beautiful book!
