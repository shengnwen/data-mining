I think this book is the best among the standard "undergraduate" textbooks for diffeq--i.e., the ones with flashy colorful covers that are re-released in a new edition way too often.

This book is a little bit more systematic than most...it's easier to sort out the logical dependency of the material, and as a result it makes an excellent reference.  Another strong point of this book is that it goes a little bit farther than most similar books--you will probably want to hold onto this one and use it in a second course, even if another book is used.

In my opinion though, the best introductory books on differential equations are from the Springer Verlag yellow book series...check out the ones by Braun or Hubbard; they have more discussion and are more of learning texts than this one.  I also think it's a total scam the way they keep releasing new editions of this book--not much changes.  I've used the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth editions and I'd recommend any of them; nowadays the eighth edition should be sufficiently cheap to buy for next-to-nothing..
