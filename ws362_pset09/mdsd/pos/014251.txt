This book was written over 70 years ago, and it's scary how close it is to reality! It pretty much predicted McCarthyism 15 years early. Also a charismatic, ultra-conservative president who is closely allied with religious extremists. President Windrip here is so close to GWB. Luckily the Patriot act and similar outrages haven't come anywhere close to the things that happen in this book. Yet.....
