Joko Beck really has created a unique brand of American Zen, which is one of the reasons I liked this one so much - not a lot of Japanese mumbo jumbo. Most the Zen Books out there right now are not that simple to understand and have terminology you have to be a Buddhist scholar to interpret. Also, check out Open Mind Zen - it's another American Zen style book that is intelligible to the average reader
