I am not a farmer, nor do not live in an agricultural landscape.  However, the degredation of the rural way of life and the depredations of corporate agriculture on it have long been an interest of mine.

This series of essays goes a long way towards describing how agriculture and rural life in general could be made sustainable.  Today's 'modern' agriculture is decidedly not sustainable.

The book suffers a little for the passage of time.  Some of the essays that I'm sure were topical in 1979 seem a little dated as far as content is concerned. Berry's lyrical writing rescues them, however.  

If you have any interest in the food you eat and how it is produced, you should read this book (then join a Community Supported Agriculture farm)
