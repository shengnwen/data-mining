I was travelling overseas when a friend gave this to me to read on trains and downtime - I couldnt put it down and read and re-read it continuously.  Im a HUGE fan of Patricia Grace and find myself wanting to crawl inside her books and become a part of the characters world.  What away she has with worlds - thank you Patricia
