This is an excellent book. I am considering training for the English  channel swim and found this book excellent as a  source of vital  information with regards open water swimming.  Not only is the book from a  world expert but there is great passion in the writing as well as superb  technical aspects of swimming in open water.  I especially liked the fact  that it dealt with very long swims unlike many of the commercially  available open water books out there that are catering for triatholon  swimming distances as obviously that is where the money is with regards to  publishing and selling.It is what most long distace swimmers train for.   There are very few books on long distance open water swimming longer than a  triatholon swim so this book for me is a must.  As for the reviewer that  felt she wrote the book like a drill coach, if you want to swim something  like the english channel any approach unlike the one in this book will  equal failure
