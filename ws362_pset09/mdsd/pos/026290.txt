This book is a great resource for the serious biscotti baker.  The recipes are unusual, yet the ingredients are readily available.  Helpful hints demystify the secrets of biscotti (it really is very easy to make a batch  or two!), and the recipes lend themselves easily to substitutions.  Make  sure you try the dried cranberry/walnut variation - it can become quite  addictive
