`The Kitchen God's Wife' by Amy Tan is a fictional novel about a mother's flash back experience, Wei Wei (Wennie), who escapes from her dreaded and abusive husband, Wen Fu. The story escalates from China to America. There is a lot of drama that's very emotional and many readers will tend to feel heart broken and sad.

Winnie is just such a strong individual and I really wonder how she managed to survive, but I think every battered wife and every fearful female should read `The Kitchen God's Wife'. As in `Joy Luck Club', the mother-daughter relationship plays a vital role in this book. I have notice that Chinese mothers can really be puzzling and unpredictable because their culture brings in so many supernatural forces, superstitions, beliefs which may seem absurd and probably unthinkable for those who don't understand them and is obviously still alive in their traditions. Even if you don't have a Chinese mother, this book still digs deep into your thoughts and makes you reconsider just how well you know your mother. 

`The Kitchen God's Wife' also consists of family relationships, true friendship, human strength, despair, and above all, hopes.  If you open your heart to it, it'll probably change your life. So for those of you, who have read `The Joy Luck Club' or are interested to read something with drama, then give `The Kitchen's God Wife' a try.
