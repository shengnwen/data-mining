This book has been on the market for a number of years, but the information in it remains timely and as up to date as anything out there.  Dr Willett provides fact based information on all aspects of nutrition, and anyone who has read this book would not be at all surprised by recent study results on the effects of fat in the diet.  This is not a "how to" book, and it doesn't provide a quick fix diet like most current "nutrition" books.  What it does provide is a well founded knowledge base on diet which, if incorporated into daily life, will result in weight loss, lower cholesterol, and a general feeling of "nutritional superiority".
