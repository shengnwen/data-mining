In BLESSINGS, Anna Quindlen gives us a wonderful read. It's the story of two very different people, Lydia Blessing and Skip Cuddy. Lydia is a wealthy and difficult elderly woman who hires Skip as a handyman on her estate. She seems to have had it all, but actually her life has been filled with disappointments.  Skip lives over the garage on the estate and is a hard worker. Mrs. Blessing constantly watches him as he moves around her property.  Because she doesn't really trust anyone, she uses binoculars to make sure he does his chores and keeps busy. He is aware of her spying, but doesn't hold it against her.

Skip is a likeable guy, but he has had little guidance from his family. His poor judgment showed up when an old friend tricked and betrayed him and Skip landed in jail for a few months. Because he wants to make a go of the new job, he attempts to avoid his old friends All is going well until Skip finds an abandoned new born baby that he secretly keeps without telling a soul.  He wants the child that he names, Faith, to have the parental love and care that he lacked throughout his life.

BLESSINGS is about disappointment, love, bad judgment, secrets, betrayal and mostly, second chances. Anna Quindlen has a wonderful way with words and her lovely prose takes the reader directly to the heart of the story.
