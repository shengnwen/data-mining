The Forty Days of Musa Dagh is an historical fiction drama set in WWI Turkey.  During the war, the Turkish government imposes a policy of forced relocation on Armenian Christians living within its borders.  Refusing to leave, the residents of several villages at the foot of Musa Dagh (Moses Mountain) decide to stay and fight.  They take refuge on the mountain, constructing a fortress with their meager resources.  The band of ordinary citizens courageously holds out for forty days, sucessfully holding off the better equipped, better trained and vastly larger Turkish army.  Want to know how it ends?

The book is clearly written, and translates well from the original German.  The imagery is vivid and I really cared about the characters.  Although the book is long, there are few lulls.  It's been over 18 months since I've read this book, and I still find myself thinking about it and I remember a surprising amount of it; it's that memorable!

I was amazed that I had not even heard of this book before reading it.  The Armenian genocide in Turkey was barely mentioned in my college history classes.  It is a shame that such a well-written book about such a large atrocity (1.5 million people died) is so obscure.  Of course, there is some controversy regarding the historical accuracy of this book and of the Armenian genocide in general, but the consensus is that, except for the names and minor details, the book is accurate.
