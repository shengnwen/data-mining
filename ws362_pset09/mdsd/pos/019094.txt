This book is an excellent primer for those who don't know anything about Knowledge Management and those who need a reference on the subject. It is insightful, well written and a very quick read. It is one of those little books of gold you trip over every once in a while. It is also compact and well suited for business travel.

Don't expect me to be selling this on Amazon any time soon...this book is a Keeper
