She did it again.. she made me sit up and take notice.. I loved it and I thought it was brave of her to open up. I am sending Belly Laughs and Baby Laughs to my best friend.. she can get her own Life Laughs!! I always feel that I am reading my own stories when I read her books.. I have a 4 year old and have been through a divorce.. God Bless You Jenny!
