This was the first book I bought when I stepped into Veganland along with two other cheaper more compact books. While it took about an hour to decide on the other two books, this one jumped out at me from the get-go and introduced me to a new world where becoming vegan wasn't all hard work and having to justify my beliefs and choices.
This book, to me, is showing that it can be fun to be vegan. The recipes were more varied than I ever realised when I was a lactovegetarian and as soon as I got home from the bookstore I sifted through the pages with post-its in hand dazzled by all the recipes I wanted to try.
So far I have tried a few of the veggie recipes and a muffin recipe and all were top-notch. I can only recommend this book as a new vegan but I highly recommend it for others like me - a new lone vegan in a see of omnivores!
