You won't be dissappointed if you buy this book. It covered many (if not all) areas of life! Leslie is so motivating and inspiring! I could not put this book down! I read the whole book within 2 days! I have been going by this book this past week and have already lost 2.6 pounds! This is the best book anyone could ever buy! I can't wait for the next book she has coming out next January!
