Engrossing, exhaustive bio on one of the most fascinating men in U.S. history.  Lee is hard to know, many authors have tried to speculate what made him tick, but he is a bit of an enigma.  The author does a fine job of giving the reader a real education on Lee.  Honestly, you don't need to be a Civil War scholar, to enjoy this well researched book.  Lee was a man who believed in God and country, exceled at West Point, and was a man of letters, but at the same time he turned his back on the country of his birth, which he had sworn a oath to..to say Lee had honor is a paradox.
