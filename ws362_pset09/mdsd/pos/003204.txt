It&#8217;s been two years since the recovery of The Amulet of Samarkand, and Nathaniel (now known as John Mandrake) is a Government official in the Office of Internal Affairs, apprenticed to Jessica Whitwell.

His job is to hunt down a pack of rebellious commoners known as the Resistance, who have been causing a series of disturbances in London, aiming to destabilize the rule of the magicians.  He suspects the involvement of a girl named Kitty and her friends whom we met in his previous adventure, and although correct in this assumption, it soon becomes obvious that there is deeper evil afoot, as a destructive force hidden in a black cloud begins attacking the city, destroying buildings and magical artifacts as it goes.

When things start spiraling out of control, he is forced to call upon Bartimaeus again for help, and the adventure spirals into a saga of grave robbery, political maneuvers, foreign travel and ancient magic.

Though certainly not as good as the first, and a little too long, The Golem&#8217;s Eye makes for good reading, but is sadly lacking the sarcastic witticisms of everyone&#8217;s favorite djinn that were the high point of book one.
