As a 4th grade teacher, I am always on the look out for new books to spark interest.  The colors used are very somber which was the mood the author wasgoing for.  This is not a happy outing for the father and son, very sad.  A hard thing to find a father/grandfather.  I hope that this book willgive my students a feel for the mood at The Wall.  A very moving book, a must read
