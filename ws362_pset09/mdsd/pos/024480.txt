A nice little book about the life of a 16 year old girl killed by the Nazis.  Despite the fact that Anne was persecuted and made to live in horrible conditions, she still maintained her humanity.  Her killers however lost their humanity.  This was a sad tale of a teenage girl living a life she should not have had to live.

I learned a lot from this book.  I have scanned her diary, but have not read it completely.  This book is a great addition, because it gives you a summary history plus lots of photos on the life of Anne Frank
