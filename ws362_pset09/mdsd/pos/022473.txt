This is like the Americana version of Bennett's previous excellent compilations, THE BOOK OF VIRTUES and THE MORAL COMPASS. In the first incredible book, Virtue's, Bennett takes the reader on a journey that spans the globe and bridges time with stories of virtue from ancient Rome to the modern world, and writings from Aesop to Yeats; and the Moral Compass is predominantly poems and fables. OUR SACRED HONOR, as the dust jacket directs, is filled with "Words of advice from the Founders in stories, letters, poems and speeches."

This volume contains the same basic structure as Bennett's previous works. Seven chapters expose the reader to a compilation of our Founders thoughts and examples of Patriotism and Courage, Love and Courtship, Civility and Friendship, Education of the Head and Heart, Industry and Frugality, Justice, and finally, Piety. Like we have come to expect from Bennett's work, upon closing this book, the reader will doubtless come away, a better person. As you read the wisdom of our Founders, self-examination becomes eminent. 

There will be those who may choose to "kill the messenger" and shun this work citing Bennett as a "hypocrite" due to his indiscretions, but these short sighted and shallow individuals are ignoring a simple fact, Bennett, as a writer, or perhaps more specifically, a compiler of existing writings, is second to no one. His brilliant works are like a road map for the journey of life, and this fine book lives up completely to the high standard we've come to expect. 

Buy this book.  Read it with your children.  Teach them the important lessons in life they are not getting from our school system.  You will be rewarded a thousand times over from the price of this book.
