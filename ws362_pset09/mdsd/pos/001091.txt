Written for Business Executives, this book will help you understand the dynamics between corporate identity and value creation in business.  Lawrence D. Ackerman believes that the true strength of an organization is reflected in its identity, and its ability to use its identity to drive the creation of products and services that provide value to customers.  Ackerman posits that there should be a cycle between the identity of the company and the profit it generates.  The wealth produced by the identity of the organization should feed back into the identity that creates it.  The author has outlined a set of guidelines to identify value for the organization.  Ackerman calls them the Laws of Identity.  For example:
  1. The Law of Being:  "Any organization composed of one or more human beings is alive in its own right, exhibiting distinct physical, mental and emotional capacities that derive from, but do not transcend, the individuals who make up that organization."
  2. The Law of Individuality:  "An organization's human capacities invariably fuse into a discernible identity that makes that organization unique."
  3. The Law of Constancy:  "Identity is fixed, transcending time and place, while its manifestations are constantly changing."
