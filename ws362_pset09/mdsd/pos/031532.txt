In a world where most people associate "conservative" with radical nuts like James Dobson and Jerry Falwell, it is refreshing to see this text about libertarian-conservatives.  And Anderson's indictment of the liberal media and their blatant bias was great.  Very refreshing.

Whatever your world view, it is a great read that will get you thinking.  Give it a try.

BTW, it has nothing to do with South Park
