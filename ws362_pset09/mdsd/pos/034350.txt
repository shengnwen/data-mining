The book is well set out with reasonable descriptions for the Do It Your Selfer to follow.

As a new VW owner (with experience pulling apart Australian Holdens), I put a kit through the Carby.  Got caught out a bit following the "dismantel" instructions when the "re-assemble" instructions were "do dismantle in reverse".  The dismantle instructions just said take everything off, which I did for the course and fine adjustment screws without noting their current setting.  Putting them back, I had not idea where to set them.  Elsewhere in the "tune up section", it said to screw the fine adjustment in all the way and back it off between 2.5 and 3 turns.  No advice on the course (until the car is running and warm), so I guessed 1.25.  This seems to work OK.  Will get a Tacho to do the tune-up regime
