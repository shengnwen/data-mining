I'm a Dr. Phil fan and I my learning style is primarily audio (through listening).  I have the book, but my stepfather bought me the CD set for "Love Smart" for Christmas.  I listened to it over the period of a couple of weeks while working out in the gym (6 disc set).  

I feel that it was much better listening to him read this book, because he did a great job at conveying his message about how a woman should navigate herself in the dating scene with men.  Throughout, he touched a little on what to do if you are already in a relationship, but not much.  He also touched on internet dating nearer to the end. 

He does honestly admit that he is generalizing men, and that all men are not like what he is describing or referring to.  He was basing his opinions on years of his own professional experience in his practice. Throughout he reminds the listener to use his advice as a guide and to use basic common sense.   

There was the voice of a woman who periodically gave some of the highlights which helped "bring the message home", tying together the points from each chapter Dr. Phil spoke on.  Her voice was a fresh break from Dr. Phil's Texas drawl and occassional "fussing at you" (although I am from Texas and I am used to it).

A good read, but to me, a better listen
