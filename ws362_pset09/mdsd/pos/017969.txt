Among its many other delights, this book has my favorite "butler-narrator" in all of fiction, Gabriel Betteredge.  Betteredge's insights into the British upper classes are downright hilarious.

Take, for example, the passage in which he describes Miss Rachel and Mr. Franklin's newfound passion for decorative painting.  After noting that the lives of the British gentlefolks are spent, for the most part, "in looking about them for something to do," he goes on: 

"Nine times out of ten they take to tortuing something or spoiling something -- and they firmly believe they are improving their mind, when the plain truth is, they are only making a mess in the house.  I have seen them . . . go out, day after day, for example, with empty pillboxes, and catch newts and beetles and spiders and frogs, and come home and stick pins through the miserable wretches, or cut them up, without a pang or remorse, into little pieces. . . . . As for Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel, they tortured nothing, I am glad to say.  The simply confined themselves to making a mess; and all they spoilt, to do them justice, was the panelling of a door." 

Betteredge has the loyalty of all good British butlers, but it's a tongue-in-cheek sort of loyalty.  At one point, the main detective in the story makes a case against Miss Rachel.  I love Betteredge's response, in which he advises the reader to "cultivate a superiority to reason":

"It was downright frightful to hear him piling up proof after proof against Miss Rachel, and to know, while one was longing to defend her, that there was no disputing the truth of what he said.  I am (thank God!) constitutionally superior to reason.  This enabled me to hold firm to my lady's view, which was my view also."

The witty narrative voices and the whodunnit plot make this a fun and fast read
