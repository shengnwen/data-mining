A Tale of Two Cities is a story about a family and friends dealing with the events of the French revolution. It spans from 1775 to 1793. The main focus of the story is the events before and during the early part of the French revolution. This is what brought my attention to the book in the first place and did not disappoint. Dickens weaves an elaborate plot together between London and Paris (hence the Two cities). Some of the best parts of the book take place in talking about the conditions in France. Dickens gives a fair account of the absolutely poverty the French underclass was made to live in and the obvious anger that it aroused. I also found the storming of the Bastille one of the most exciting and engaging parts of the book. Having not read Dickens in years I had forgotten how magnificent of a writer he was. His descriptions are some of the best you could ever find. 

That being said, overall I was not a big fan of large parts of this novel.  As another reviewer said, it is a classic and is meant to be a character study. I would agree with that but it seemed like one of the most important characters (Sydney Carton) is hardly in large sections of the book. As you reach the end of the book, I find it hard to really sympathize with him.  I think Dickens spends too much time in the middle on Dr. Manette and Lucy.

I would defiantly recommend this book. I am glad I read it but I do not really have any desire to read it again.
