Virginia Woolf was a true literary genius, with a gift for capturing the emotional lives of her characters that isn't often seen in modern writing.  That said, To the Lighthouse is one of her more difficult works; it follows the character's internal lives in a very Joyce-ian way, and like all true stream of consciousness writing, can be hard to fully comprehend.  But the depth of feeling she manages to encapsulate with her deft turn of phrase is remarkable, and well worth reading.  I don't recommend this novel for those who have never read Woolf before.  Start with Mrs. Dalloway, and when you read To the Lighthouse later, you'll appreciate it more.
