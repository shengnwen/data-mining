I was a Democrat before I read this book. I now lean Libertarian. This book cannot but change at least some of your views on public policy.
Having said that, Friedman and the Libertarian party overestimate the wisdom and knowledge of the public. There is no shortage of stupid people out there who need the state to tell them what they can or cannot do. Freedom is great but is subordinate to personal well-being
