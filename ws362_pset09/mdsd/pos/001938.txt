I've been playing the drum in it's kit form for about 10 years now and not until I started working in a drum shop did I feel the urge to want to actually learn about the instrument I was playing.

Sure, I knew HOW to play, and what everything was called and how to repair a few things, change heads, tune, set up and tear down... everything you need to play in an active band and tour.. but I never fully understood why it mattered how many plies a tom was made out of, and I never knew there was a big difference between the type of "mahogany" starter kits are made of and the way companies like DW make their higher end drum shells out of several plies of DIFFERENT kinds of wood all working together.

This book explores anything and everything you could possibly think of as far as the basic drum kit goes. If you are looking for a place to start as far as learning about drums, this book is a must have, but even if you've been playing for a decade this book is still great to have on the shelf. 

I'm not finished with it yet, but half way through I am more than pleased that I gave this book a chance. It's been a big help and it's showed me exactly what I've missed by not paying attention to the details of drums.
