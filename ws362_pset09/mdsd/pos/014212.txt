I've been long familiar with Lesy's Wisconsin Death Trip. It clearly demonstrated how the work of utilitarian photographers often has more to say about an age and the human world around us then do  the products of those with a more "artistic" bent. Angel's World nicely  complements that mold with often startling realism. Lesy's introduction is a grand addition to the topic of a  lone and arguably mad picture taker of New York City scenes and people. It deserves a careful reading and the photos deserve careful thought.
