Binnie Kirshenbaum is one of my favorite authors because she's honest and  incredibly funny.  Her characters are real and never fail to remind me of  someone I know. I think there's a part of Lila, the heroine of PURE POETRY,  in all of us. As Lila struggles with her own identity and getting past her  failed marriage, she exposes insecurities that all of us have -- and oh so  many idiosyncrasies. If only we all had such a sense of humor!   Kirshenbaum's wit is subtle and enduring, and this time around demonstrates  a new level of maturity. I loved the friendly ghosts in Lila's apartment  and I'm truly sorry I can't get an appointment with her crossdressing  therapist. I thought the author couldn't write anything better than her  last novel, A DISTURBANCE IN ONE PLACE.  Now I can't wait for her next work  to be published. If you've never read a work by Binnie Kirshenbaum before,  you'll be delighted to discover her
