Michael Goldman's Imperial Nature searches for answers to questions such as "Why is the World Bank so successful?" and "Why has the World Bank become the central target for anti-globalization movements worldwide?" For anyone looking to find out more about the World Bank and its prowess, this is a great and explanatory book for you. Not only does it discuss in depth the increase in poverty in poor countries, but covers the ins and outs of the World Bank and the process in making its decisions. Surprisingly, yet not surprisingly enough, any major decisions are based on the economic gain or profit the bank will receive. Let us never forget, the World Bank is still a Bank. When you read this book, questions will arise such as "What are the Bank's true motives", "Are there ever zero casualties in a reform or rebuilding project" and "In the future should we as a people look forward to corruption or green neoliberalism?" What do we have to look forward to in the future regarding economic neoliberalism, safety-net welfareism, good governance, free trade, global integration, and investments in "civil society"? Goldman reflects deeply on most of these questions and allows the reader to formulate his or her own opinions regarding the World Bank. It was definitely a worth while read and I closed the book feeling both angry and understanding of the World Bank.
