By far, the most impressive, knowledgeable and useful guide to everything from the decision to start your own design business to handling the press, buyers and everything else. 

It's not a book that sugarcoats the truth about how hard it is to succeed in this business and how few succeed at all. Even established designers who didn't lay the right foundations, had it come back to bite them. It starts you off in the right mindset and helps you learn from the mistakes and experiences of others, so that you don't waste time and money screwing up by yourself!

A must have book
