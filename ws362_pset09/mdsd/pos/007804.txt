still missed some ingredients of a great novel should have. the blue nowhere or the big nowhere, either way, this is just a not-too-bad novel. 
hacker or kracker, phreaking out or what, appz, warez, downloadz, dllz, http or ftp, anti virus softwarez....
did anybody ever realize that norton anti-virus by itself somehow is actually a trojan horse virus that always tries to rewriting your registris and continuously sending in a lot of cookies in your o/s and hard drives? nortons and microsoft's warez have always got your computer backdoor wide open for them to look into your files and sending mucho cookies to send out your private infoz to them. did anybody ever suspect those viruses might be just churned out from the dark backrooms of these big anti-virus products companies? without virus, how could they made money out of your pockets? why all these things supposed to last long now all with short lifespans? why all these goods now being tagged as 'consumer goods'? you tell me. if you don't consume them fast enough or let them turn bad, how could them continuously make money out of you? 
did anybody realized that norton internet security program just  blocks so many supposed-to-be good softwarez, even browsers such as netscape and mozilla's firefox, treated them as trojan horse virus and won't allow them to be installed and work properly? why nortons only allowed microsoft's internet explorer functional normally? is there any secret deals or conspiracy behind these? 
yes, the blue nowhere indeed put a new understanding to these canny possibilities into my mind when i read this novel. but until i completely uninstalled nortons anti-virus and internet security programz, those browsers never worked, and i have to get into windows registries to completely delete anything related to nortons, nothing seemed to work properly, and lot of legally good websites were totally blocked. i rest my case
