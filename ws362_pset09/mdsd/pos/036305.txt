Ho, Ho, Ho. Merry Christmas! The ladies from "the Hot Flash Club" are making a return visit for the holidays. They are getting together at Shirley's Haven (a spa for women of "a certain age.") All is merry while trimming the tree, and then life happens.

Polly, the newest member of the group almost burns down her daughter-in-law's house; Faye takes a fall while at the airport for a family reunion; Marilyn is caring for her mother, with all that puts on one's plate, and receives a surprise from her boyfriend; Alice's family is having their own issues; and Marilyn gives money to her younger boyfriend and thinks he's going to pop the question. 

There are misunderstandings, miscommunications, big and small disasters and challenges to friendships just like real life. And that's what I like about Thayer's books. She's writing about life. Sometimes it feels like it's my own. 

Thayer's books have numerous characters and storylines, and it helps if you've read all the books. I have and it makes following the characters and storylines easier. This is my favorite of the three books. It will make you smile, tug at your heartstrings, and you'll be happy you took the time to read Hot Flash Holidays. 

Armchair Interviews says: Gift yourself a gift this Christmas. Read and enjoy Hot Flash Holidays. It's a hoot!
