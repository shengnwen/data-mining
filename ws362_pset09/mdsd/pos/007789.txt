Nathan McCall is now 2 for 2.  After the classic "Makes me Wanna Holler,"  he gives us this insightful read.  Some might think he harps on racial issues too much, but even in 2002, these issues are still relevant to so many.  His chapter on gangster rap is right on the money, and I would even add, as an educator, that rap music has become a bad influence on all races (suburban whites buy more hardcore rap than anyone else).  His chapter on Muhammad Ali is one of the most poignant pieces I have ever read, and left me in tears.  So often while reading this, you find yourself nodding your head, agreeing with what he's saying.  We're lucky to have his perceptive books, and I like many am wondering when his next one is coming (it's been 5 years!).  Hopefully soon Mr. McCall
