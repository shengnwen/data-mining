This was a story so full of twists I feel I have to be careful not to give anything away here. Several seemingly unrelated stories follow each other: in 1970, in Cambridge, a mathematician and his wife have a terrible marriage, but keep on having children. Things come to a head when the youngest child disappears one hot summer night and is not found. The second chapter is about a solicitor whose younger daughter is murdered in a horribly violent scene while working at her father's office. Her murderer is not found. The third chapter involves another unhappy marriage in which the wife appears to be suffering from post-partum depression. She is also an uber-perfectionist who came from a ghastly family background. The husband is murdered with an axe and the wife is found guilty and serves time in prison. Each of the families contacts a detective who is a former Cambridge police inspector. This all happens at the beginning of the book. The stories become interwoven and each is eventually solved, but don't expect to be able to guess who did what. I had trouble putting this book down. The author claims she didn't base the novel on actual events, but then she has some imagination. You'll want to read it right through to the end.
