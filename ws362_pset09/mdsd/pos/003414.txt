Looking for Alaska was a revetting and touching story. It show what every child or young adult goes through in a stage of his/her life. Miles story of his life at boarding schools is both funny and emotional. My favorite feature in this book is that most of the adults that appear in the book are more like real people then those who just want to make a teens life miserable. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy a good book about a teen facing tragedies and gaining friendship from unexpected places, you won't want to put it down until you have read the whole thing. This is a good read and was well written, a must read for all teens.
