It does not matter if this book is statistically flawed or not. The merit in this book is the candid and revealing responses men made regarding everything that they think and feel about sex, sexual acts, women, women's bodies, their own bodies, their sexuality, etc. Reading it at a young age made me a more understanding, communicative, patient and confident lover. As much as sexuality pervades our culture, there is not a lot of honesty around sex. This book is very honest. I cannot vouch for levels of statistical significance, but I can tell you this was a very important book in my understanding of the male and sexual universe, and statistics had nothing to do with that.
