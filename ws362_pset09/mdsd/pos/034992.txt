This is a nice scholarly approach to the theme of love between members of the same sex. it could be brothers, sisters, mothers/daughters and friends. It should not be mistaken for a book on homosexuality although that theme is one element. it is sensitive to the deep feelings felt by members of the same sex. nice easy ready with a personel touch
