I searched out this set because my teacher of Chinese medicine had told me that it was her favorite book as a teenager and that she still had the fondest memories of it - yet, she had never read it in English.

When I saw her later she told me that her daughter was upset that she hadn't thought of this book for her mom as it brought her so much happiness
