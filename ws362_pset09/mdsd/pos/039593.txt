This book seems, to me, an excellent expanded followup to the concepts intitially presented in Wilsons' Prometheus Rising. In tandem, the two books really do help one to gain knowledge of the brain software that interprets the information that forms our varying tunnels of reality. The personal gains one percieves from the knowledge presented in these books will be just that, very personal, depending on ones' experience. So further explanations of the fruits contained within this work and its predecessor will be fairly useless. That being said, I highly recommend this book for the potential fruits one could reap.
 As for the review from Mike the Physicist from CA. Haha..hehe..A perfect example of the narrowness of perception about which Wilson teaches. Apparently, being a &quot;professional physicist&quot; could not evaluate the content on anything else but the presentation of the physics concepts. However, this is not a physics book. It is a psychology/philosophy book with proofs that reach into concepts of modern physics. And in this regard, the book succeeds perfectly. I have read the works of Neils Bohr(a physicist and primary reference for Wilson) as well as many of the books that &quot;mike from CA&quot; has referenced. And no where does Wilson falter in his presentation of the concepts. Nor does the book venture into concepts beyond the grasp of the laymen, thus succeeding in its mission. However, maybe failing for Mike who needed a dissertation to satisfy his professionally induced ego. geez.
