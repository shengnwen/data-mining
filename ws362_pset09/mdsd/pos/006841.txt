I absolutely love this book!  I'm actually 19 and getting ready to get married but didn't want to put my e-mail or anything in.  I have been freaking out over how to make my own veil and decorations.  This book is definately great if you are on a tight budget but still want a beautiful wedding.  You can make everything from decorations, centerpieces, veils, garters, ringbearer pillows and a whole lot more.  I just got the book yesterday and am EXTREMELY pleased with it.  I've already started on my veil.  :
