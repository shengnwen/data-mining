The Lighthouse

If you have read P.D. James before, there is no need to read any further for this is another of her gripping mysteries that will keep you up late into the night reading it. How does a nice lady like her come up with the most vile forms of murder for Adam Dalgliesh and his team to solve?

This mystery could be called an "English Manor-House Mystery" since all of the characters, innocent, guilty, victims and investigators are all sequestered leaving us to decide who-dun-it

If you have a good map of the southwest of England, look for the island of Combe with its famous lighthouse off of the coast of Cornwall on the edge of the Bristol Channel. You will have a hard time finding it even on the best and latest of the Ordnance Survey charts. Why is that? In the book, P.D. James explains that the island is owned by a private trust. That trust has been sucessful in keeping the existence of this island unknowns to those who are not islanders. This book may change that.
