Cannell manages in his Shane Scully novels to combine interesting and almost plausible plots with three-dimensional characters who talk and behave like real people.  The dialogue is often brilliant, with terrific one liners and sarcasm to keep the reader's interest.  My favorite characters with Cannell are the antagonists, in this case the contradictory Dennis Valentine and the squirmy, hilarious Nicky Marcela.  The plot is entertaining enough, but I love the book for the interactions between the characters.  Yes, everyone is uniformly handsome/gorgeous.  Yes, there are shallow LA stereotypes on every page.  The two main complaints I had were with the extraneous gang plot and the incredibly annoying character of Chooch, Shane's obnoxious and stupid son.  I think Cannell writes the kind of books Stuart Woods attempts (but SW seems to lack the creativity and lively dialogue to be mentioned in the same breath)
