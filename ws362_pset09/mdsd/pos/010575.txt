I disagree with a number of the previous reviewers.  I think Acker uses her style effectively to drive a point home.  She is rewriting the canon from a perspective of pain and oppression and her way of doing this is by attacking the very language that aids in her oppression.  Janie must relearn language in her own way, hence we watch this process begin through drawings and a relaearning of the alphabet and finally a reconstruction and retelling of well known tales (e.g. The Scarlet Letter).  Rather than being only dark and painful, I found the end to be somewhat uplifting by offering a glimmer of hope through the banding together of society's castoffs.  It's a difficult book, but I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing what happens when an author attempts to rewrite a personal history and in doing so urges us all to deconstruct our own narratives
