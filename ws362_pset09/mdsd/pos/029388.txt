I had been immersed in the psychoanalytic process for over three years when I came across this book.  Having experienced, first hand, the soulful aspects of analysis, both pleasant and painful, I connected instantly to Dr. Frattaroli's accounts of his work with patients.  I am convinced that the only sane and solid path to emotional well being is the long, introspective one described so eloquently in this book.  If you have ever considered beginning psychoanalysis (or you are simply interested in learning more about what it means to be fully human) then I strongly recommend that you read this book
