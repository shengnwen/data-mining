to me, the atmosphere is what made this book great.  to just imagine living in a place called the "Black Middens" eating chocolates and corned beef with a little girl called heaven eyes whose 'grandpa' scribbles in a big book by day and digs for treasure in the middens by night is just awesome.  You'll find yourself thinking about this book and the black Black Middens a lot.  There's something creepy in this book, but its sort of happy and peaceful at the same time.  Just read it and you'll see
