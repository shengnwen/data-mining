Words really fail to describe how breathtaking this book is. Not mainly because of the author, but because of the subject - God himself. I can't think of any book I've read that has left me more stunned and awed by God and his majesty. Charnock was a Puritan, so this book may be cumbersome to those unaccustomed to Elizabethan English. But if you can handle the KJV, you can handle this. It is also a comprehensive book - long, despite the fact that the chapters are really just lengthy meditations put in a sermonic form. Characteristically Puritan, Charnock begins each chapter with the exposition of a text, then develops its "doctrine," bridging into a lengthy theological study on one of God's attributes, finally ending on the "use" or application. The application sections are especially helpful and heart-searching, but really all of it is good. Though, I must confess I've not read it all (this book must be 1200 pages long!), I've benefited from the hours I've spent in these pages. No human author will ever write an exhaustive study on the character of God, but I can't imagine anyone coming closer to it than Charnock. This is a powerful, powerful book
