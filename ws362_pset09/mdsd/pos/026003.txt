I think the recent reviews of this book have been unfair.  I have looked at the beginning chapters of this recent (6th)revision and I think the book has remained a great quality Cell Biology book.  As stated in other reviews, the book is detailed, but most good schools will require you to know at least the level of detail presented in this book and likely more.  I found this book to be an excellent preparation for more advanced classes in Cell Biology (which used Alberts) and Biochemistry.  The book is organized to make sure the students have the underlying knowledge to successfully understand more complex concepts later.  The only major drawback of this book is that Alberts exists and the eloquence and sophistication in Alberts is lacking in Becker's World of the Cell.  That said, I still recommend this book for people needing to know and understand all the basics of Cell biology/biochemistry
