Remarkably candid and insightful book into the  life and incredible World War II military experiences of this belated black Medal of Honor  winner. Story of combat is absolutely rivoting, and the degree of courage unimagineable. -The author remains, throughout, fully human, immensely patient and aware of his own strengths and limitations.  -His description of racial discrimination is balanced and, ultimately, heroic. He is not bitter, and he continues to work for true integration. -If you want a hero to admire, READ THIS BOOK
