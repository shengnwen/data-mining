Thomas Morton's life and influence on early America is under appreciated.In a very entertaining section of the book Dempsey reveals how Morton has been received during the course of our history.Dempsey brings to  life the ebullient,prickly,roguish character that Morton was.I learned a  great deal about the politics of colonial religious life especially as it  effected Native Americans. Of course this influence is still with us today  and Dempsey's exegesis on this subject is powerful and persuasive.This book  is scholarly but also lots of naughty fun
