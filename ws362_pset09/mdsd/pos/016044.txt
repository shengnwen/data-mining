If you know nothing about programming and you are curious about it then you should buy this book.
Although it doesn't cover much of the fundamentals in programming with Visual Basic, it is very well written and the pictures very helpful in guiding you through your first steps, creating applications from the first pages.

BUT, if you like what you see int his book and want to learn more, then you need to buy more books and spend much much more time.

In general, if you want to have a hobby, and it's programming then this is your very first choice.
