VINTAGE RESTAURANT: HANDCRAFTED CUISINE FROM A SUN VALLEY FAVORITE comes from one who began his culinary career over thirty years ago, working in many restaurants before his Vintage Restaurant developed a blend of French cuisine and Western influence. VINTAGE RESTAURANT gathers these innovations for home cooks, offering up dishes that excel in unusual blends from a Szechwan Carrot Soup to Asian Mahogany Chicken Bowl and more. Color photos throughout add the finishing touch and flair to a title that home chefs will welcome for its original dishes.
