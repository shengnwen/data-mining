It amazes me the amount of venom spewed by the negative reviewers of this book.  Many of them are from countries outside the U.S. who simply hate this country as much as Mr. Moore does.  Why would a book - which I might add is clearly true - generate so much animosity?  Mr. Moore should have guessed - being the brilliant, self-righteous man of the people that he is - that a truth-seeker somewhere might actually call him on his fact bending, Republican loathing, products of BS?  i.e., F911, Bowling, Stupid White Men, etc.
This is a very good book.  It's a very entertaining read.  Enough said.  Pick it up and enjoy!
