This book may not help you find a life-long satisfying career, but IT WILL help you understand yourself much better.  I found the exercises easy to complete, helpful and quite informative.

The book will take you through a thorough self-assessment, and I like that you can get through the book quickly, but still put it down and pick it back up later when needed. When compared to similar books, this one is easier to navigate and is not at all painful.

The author helps you categorize yourself into one (or several) of the following work situations: Where's the meaning, Been There Done that, Bruised and gun-shy (recently downsized), Bored and plateaued, Yearning to be on your own and One toe in the retirement pool.

I have already recommended this book to two friends in the last week.  While I simply checked a copy out of the library, I recommend this as a book worth purchasing
