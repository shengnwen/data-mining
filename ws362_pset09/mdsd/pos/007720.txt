I liked this book.  It provides a decent overview of emergent properties in general, and particularly the notion of "intelligence" as an emergent property (e.g., one ant is dumb, many ants togther are smart).

However, this book will disappoint any reader who expects a rigorous or mathematical explanation of these phenomena.  All of the various anecdotes are interesting, but they appear held together by only their loose similarity of concept (i.e., they all somehow or other manifest this notion "emergence").

Although this book reads like a collection of similarly themed magazine articles, this is part and parcel with its appeal.  Although it may have skimped on the "research" into the fascinating field of emergent properties, it was nevertheless well-written, readable, and interesting. 

Although the notion of "Emergent Intelligence" has already been siezed upon by popular culture (e.g., Matrix, video games, internet, and on and on), the diversity and importance of this topic is far from its peak.  Therefore, the more people with an understanding of it the better -- even if that understanding falls somewhere short of the Ph.d. level
