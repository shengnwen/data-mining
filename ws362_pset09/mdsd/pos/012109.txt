  Chopra has several great insights in this book. If you use his "unitary-world" approach, you accept whatever happens as what you need at the time: less conflict, strife, and alienation. Also, he has an intriguing notion about the on-switch and the off-switch of the universe: when it is in "off," one can reimagine the world to be the way you want it to be, and achieve much with little effort: sort of like using leverage in the physical plane. Much here that will improve your life. His central metaphor of the butterfly, transformed from the caterpillar, underscores the mysterious, unpredictable nature of transformation, which will work in your life too, if you carefully apply Chopra's precepts
