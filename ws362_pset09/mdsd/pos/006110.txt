I've been tearing through Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon mysteries ever since I discovered them.  The tighest and best story in my opinion is Firestorm - this one was a little harder to follow and I'm not sure I ever totally understood the denouement of the mystery.  But like with all the Pigeon novels, the characters and physical setting were interesting and well-drawn, and the story arcs that continue from book to book are intriguing, such as the relationship between Anna and her sister, and the relationship between Anna and Frederick the FBI agent (be prepared to be surprised!)  I don't think I'm going to read anything else until I've finished all the Anna Pigeon books out there - on to Blind Descent!
