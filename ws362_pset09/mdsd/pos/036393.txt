Aaron Lansky has devoted his adult life to rescuing, collecting, cataloging, and re-distributing hundreds of thousand of books written in Yiddish.  They rescued the books from abandoned libraries, dumpsters, and taken publishers' complete collection when the publisher closed their business doors. They also accepted the private libraries of elderly people who wanted the story of each book preserved as well as serving Lansky and his cadre of volunteers kugel.  

The book is funny, erudite, heartwarming, and heartbreaking.  Lansky's style is very easy to read, and he draws you into his obsession one book at a time.
