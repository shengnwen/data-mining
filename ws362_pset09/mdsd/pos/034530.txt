On Value and Values is a great book on how to actionably get out of the mindset of Us versus Them; Value to the negation of Values.  It's akin to the Lakota &quot;All My Relations&quot; in that it asks us to rethink how we think of ourselves.  We are not one citizen/employee of one country/company, but part of an enormous web of relationships.  Our actions affect and are affected by everything that we do, even if it seems insignificantly local, place-based, or otherwise.  Using real-life examples and with some real prescriptions for how to escape dangerous myopic perspectives, Smith weaves a path out of Us versus Them.  Terrific
