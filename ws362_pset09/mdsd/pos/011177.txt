I REALLY enjoyed this book.  And the last page was like "OH MY GOSH".  So I guess we will be getting book II.  This was a very quick read.  The only thing I did not like about it was when she introduced a person it would be awhile before you saw them again and you had to remember back or look back to get an idea.  Loved this book and I will read it again.  As far as the Sylvia Brwon issue goes.......Who Cares.
