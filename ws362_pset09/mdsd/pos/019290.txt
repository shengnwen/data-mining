MOUNTAIN MAN continues to be a classic in American Western literature.  The major foundation for the movie, Jeremiah Johnson, MOUNTAIN MAN tells the story of Samuel John Minard, a mountain man known for his physical prowess and for his quick and educated intellect. A renaissance man who has chosen the life of the great American West.  

In his adventures Sam meets up with Indians of various tribes, other mountain men and a crazy pilgrim woman.  HIs marriage to an Indian maiden leads him into a one-man war with sweeping consequences for himself and for his enemies.

MOUNTAIN MAN, as is the case with most books upon which movies are based, considerably outshines JEREMIAH JOHNSON in its story and characterizations.  But, hey, I love the movie as well.  I guess that says a lot about what I think of the book.
