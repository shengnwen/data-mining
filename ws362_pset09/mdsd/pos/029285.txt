&quot;Acting for Animators&quot; is a real must-have book for any serious character animator. I agree that sometimes it needs a bit of digging around to find the information you are searching for because they are embedded into the chapters but hey: Isn't it the same with &quot;Illusion of Life&quot; for example - you have to study it in-depth and not just read it. But as soon as you have really taken the time to get a hold of the informations in the book your animation quality will rise. Also look out for any of Mr. Hooks &quot;Acting for Animators&quot; - Classes in your area. This is really the best acting education you can get in the world being an animator
