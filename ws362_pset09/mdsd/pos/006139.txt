I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Balch who relies on natural therapies and preventative remedies to avoid surgery or to stop using pharmaceutical medications, adding conventional treatment if needed depending on the severity and the response of the patient.  This latest reference book (724 pages) is also presented in an easy-to-understand, knowledgeable, informative way revealing many alternative means to resolve the various human conditions which if followed result in a real blessing.  A great book for an informed approach to healthful living
