Dr. Desoto is a humorous well illustrated story of a mouse dentist and how he solved a problem in an unexpected way. I have read this book to several children 5-8 yr. age range and they all loved it and wanted to borrow it. Parents will appreciate Dr, Desoto's desire to maintain his professional integrity
