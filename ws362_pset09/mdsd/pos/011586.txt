After reading The Pact I promised not to read another Jodi Picoult. Two days later I purchased Salem Falls after reading the blurb. The opening sentence caught me and I literally didn't put the book down until I finished it. 

This book is very cleverly structured and I am sure that only a handful of very astute readers didn't have to back to previous chapters to re-read the blatant clues that they had missed. 

My sympathies were with Jack until he found himself outside the school giving advice to another young girl - why would put himself in such a vulnerable position after the trauma he had just been through having to plead guilty to statutory rape when he was innocent? In the end I was only praying that he wasn't convicted because I wanted Addie to be happy.
