So I found out this book was being released by complete accident. I loved the first 3 and was anxious to see how this one wrapped everything up. I didn't like Kaede at all in this book. She annoyed me to no end. I was also not completely thrilled with the ending, although I do believe it finished off the series and didn't leave any more questions. Overall it was a good read.
