This book made me look at people (men and women) in a different way. Now I always wonder what people really do behind closed doors. You really have to have an open and curious mind to enjoy this book. I loved the book, though some of the stories seem a bit redundant. Also the author tends to express her opinions alot. If she was so judgemental she shouldn't have written the book
