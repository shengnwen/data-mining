This anthology adds to a growing literature about the multiple aspects of cyberspace. I found several of the chapters particularly helpful in the examination of the intersections of race and gender in cyberspace. While there are many books that deal with gender and cyberspace, there are not as many that deal with race or racism for that matter. If you read and enjoyed _Cyberghetto or Cybertopia? Race, Class and Gender on the Internet_, you will appreciate this book
