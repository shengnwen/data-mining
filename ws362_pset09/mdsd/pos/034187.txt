I read this book on a trans-Atlantic flight and was trying not to burst out laughing the entire trip.  But the other passengers around me were intrigued by my constant giggling and the cover of the book.  

While this book is very funny, I especially like the overall messages of self-esteem and self-reliance wrapped up in southern manners and traditions, such as the advice on those majorette boots you wanted all those years ago
