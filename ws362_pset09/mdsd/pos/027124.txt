Dr. Kirshiner spins a good yarn.  The focus of the book is mostly on the story and history of the accelerating universe theory, presented in a very readable style.  I would only fault the book in that after reading it, while I'm now comfortable with the idea of the accelerating universe, I would have liked to see more of the science and math involved.  It's a great overview, though; recommended
