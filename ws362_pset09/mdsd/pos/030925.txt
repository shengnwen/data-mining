I admired Senator Obama, but I wanted to know more about him.  Now I can only hope that someone with his integrity, values, intellect, honesty, modesty and motivation can lead this country in the future.  I really feel like I know "Barry" and hope I am fortunate enough to hear Senator Obama speak in the near future.  The book has so many story lines 1) Growing up inter-racial, 2) Learning about his African family 3) The influence of grandparents 3) Becoming focused as a young adult after a confusing childhood 4) the life of a community organizer and much more!  I was only sorry it ended when it did
