Any fan of Melville's writing who has not read this seminal and still unequaled critical study and biography has sheer pleasure in store. Arvin's  intelligence and immense knowledge are seamlessly matched by a writing  style that is measured and seductive. Anybody reading this study without  knowing jack about Melville would probably be so excited that s/he would  have to rush out to buy the complete works. This book is worth whatever  effort you have to invest to find a copy. The question is: why is this TRUE  classic out-of-print
