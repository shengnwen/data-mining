Michener's vast novel about the men and women who have lived in the Lone Star state (or the land that would one day become it) over the last almost 500 years is a heavy, thorough reading experience. The story of our nation's most famous state is here in all its gritty glory. From the first days of the Spanish explorers, through the era of foreign domination, the missionaries, the Indians, the coming of the whites and the war for Texican independence, the days of the cowboys and cattle barons, the discovery of oil, the 20th century boom all the way to the state's 150th anniversary in 1986. Literally thousands of characters populate this gigantic (I'm resisting saying "Texas-sized") book. Everything's here in the great story of Texas
