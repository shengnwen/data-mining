Of all the poker authorities out there, I'll put Phil Gordon in the top three, along with Brunson & Sklansky. Without being arrogant or aloof, he explains the history and techniques of the game. He explains the odds and math in very simple terms that anyone can understand and benifit from. Phil walks you through the stages of learning the game. You learn how to play on line and setting up your own home game. He then walks you through moving from low to middle limit games. "The Real Deal" will definitely step your game up a few levels. This is a great addition to anyone's poker library.
