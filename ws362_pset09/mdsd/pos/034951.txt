This book is a good introduction to what happened in guatemala.  I do agree with another reviewer who felt that the author was a bit biased but by reading her story it is easy to understand why.  It would be good to also read some other accounts to get a better overview.  But some of the  first-person accounts were so eye-opening.  There is a great variety of  experiences shared
