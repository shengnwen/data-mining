I know a lot of people found this book quite tedious and sanctimonious but I actually liked it! It was sparkling, often witty, and it had some excitement thrown in for good measure.

What you have to remember that this is a book of its times, and in some places it is a book out of time in that it allows a girl of low birth to rise to the heady heights of being a gentleman's wife.

Okay, so she has to endure the aforesaid gentlemen abusing her at first because of her desire to remain chaste and a good virtuous daughter to her poor but honest parents whom she regularly writes too.

This book is a series of letters and a narrative when necessary that follows Pamela (the heroine) from the time of her good Lady Mistresses death to her marriage to Mr B and in between that, she is kidnapped, held prisoner, almost tricked into a false marriage and tormented by her husband to be snobbish sister.

The book is comic in parts and the two protagonists are incredibly bumptious but you meet a plethora of characters who only add to this delightful story of a young girl holding onto her virtue which she has put a value on, (something no common working girl would ever do in the time this book was written) and getting her just rewards, a wealthy husband who dotes on her and gives her all that she desires.

I wouldn't call this a social commentary in the way that Jane Austen's books were, in a way it is a bit of a fairytale but it is a delightful fairytale all the same and is well worth the effort to get around the awkward old English that it is written in
