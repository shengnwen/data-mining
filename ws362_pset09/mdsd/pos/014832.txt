This is a thoroughly enjoyable novel that is both heartbreaking and hilarious.  Cadence Roth is a dwarf living in Hollywood under the shadow of a famous character she onced played.  She just wants to be an actress, but as you can imagine roles for dwarves are few and far between. Although it would be easy to feel sorry for Cadence we don't, she's just too resourceful, witty and strong for pity. Cadence's story is not always a happy one, but it is ultimately uplifting.  A highly recommended novel
