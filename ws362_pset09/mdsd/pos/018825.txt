This book really ministered to me. At the time I was reading "Boy Meets Girl" it helped me to realize that I was in a relationship that wasn't what God wanted for my life. I thank God for Joshua and Shannon Harris and for the work that they've accomplished for the kingdom. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about or involved in a relationship. Seriously, this book will revolutionize your outlook on dating.
