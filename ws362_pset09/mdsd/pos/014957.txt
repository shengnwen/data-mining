This was the first novel by Ms Gregory that I've read and I did enjoy it.
There were some flaws. First, I question some historical accuracy....that brother George was [...] for example. In truth many historians portray him as quite a womanizer. Secondly, how could Mary, sister to Anne Boleyn and Henry's first mistress, be so utterly unaware of what life at court was all about? Her sister was so astute...as was her brother, father and mother.  Mary is portrayed as almost witless at times and she could not possibly have been such a dimwit and survived a week in that hot-bed of intrigue and deceit that was Henry's court. At this time, woman were merely chattel so the high ideals of woman's rights espoused by many characters didn't quite work.  On the other hand,  I do think Ms. Gregory's prose moves right along, and she  was accurate on major political details. In addition, she captured wonderfully the ambiance of court life, the beauty of the gowns, the lavish feasts and celebrations, and the totally decadent lifestyle.   She also  captured the character of Henry the VIII, a man so deluded by his own place in life he thought he could usurp God. How could he not see himself as an abolute ruler with all the fawning and false admiration from his courtiers? I saw him as a sad man, facing old age and diminished physical strength without an honest and loving companion, without a single person he could truly trust. He had everything and nothing. 
This book held my interest throughout which is saying something for a book of what, 700 pages? and made we want to read non-fiction books about this time.
