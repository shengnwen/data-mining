This book is about an assassin named Carl which is kept in a mercenary compound.  But this compound is all he knows he usually never gets outside this compound except for training. He is frequently brainwashed so that he can be programed to what the X group wants him to be. Later he finds out he was abducted from his hometown and he was a chaplin in the army. His real name is Johnny Drake. The real battle in this book is for him to figure out who he really is. He must chose one or the other or he will die.
This book is filled with nonstop action until the very end. This would be recommended for teenagers or young      s. This has very good Christian applications for everyday stuff like being faithful to something.
