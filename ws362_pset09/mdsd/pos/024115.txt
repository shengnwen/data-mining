I had read Love in a Cold Climate years ago, but hadn't read The Pursuit of Love.  They are both hilarious.  

The Pursuit of Love is the stronger book, but Love in a Cold Climate I found more amusing. I believe these were written in the 1930s, so the style and language can seem a little dated at times, but quaintly so.  If you know anything about the British Upper Class, they are satirically hilarious.  

Enjoy.

As other reviews more than adequately cover the two novels, my review gives you some background on the author and the circumstances that shaped her.

Love in a Cold Climate is loosely based on Mitford's own family. Famous or infamous depending on your point of view, their father did march them around the house.  As a matter of interest two of the sisters were facists Unity shot herself, Diana married Oswald Moseley. Another Decca (Jessica) wrote for articles and books including "The American Way of Dying" and Nancy is the author of numerous books, including these.  Sister Debo (Deborah) is the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire. 

The Mitfords were a wonderfully eccentric minor aristocratic family.  Nancy Mitford wrote the famous "Noblesse Oblige" about U and non-U in 1956. It is a glimpse into how the British could instantly tell if someone is truly an aristocratic/upper class or a pretender.  Upper Classes would, and often still do, say lavatory and not toilet, rich and not wealthy, spectacles and not glasses, looking glass and not mirror, drawing room and not living room or lounge and so forth. Amazing, but true!

Understanding these codes, may help you understand the books and nuances a little better.  Nancy Mitford has considerable insight and sends up her own class relentlessly.

If you want another great book with charming and hilarious antics of a young female relative forced to live with rustic eccentrics in 1930s England, read Stella Gibbons "Cold Comfort Farm". A true gem.
