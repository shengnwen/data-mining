I'll have to agree with the other reviewer as well.  This is an excellent end to the series.  So boys and girls, don't start here.  Go back to book one first.  Now, if you've read the other two, then this one won't disappoint at all.  It picks up right from the end of book two and goes full speed ahead.

There's something about Charlie Huston's writing style that is unique as well.  You get both the dialog but also a sense of what the character is thinking from a narrative view as well.  And it is not hard to follow as you might think.

I'm a fan.  Read and enjo
