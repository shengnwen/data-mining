I borrowed this book from the library and then I'm here now to buy it for my own.  This book goes through each type of disability, how they are identified and will guide you through the maze of school testing, IEP's,  and how to be your child's advocate to make sure they are getting  everything they should be getting from their education!  Great detail on  emotional growth, planning for the future and assessment measures
