Prince of Fire is a marvelous read.  Reading it after reading the other Silva books about Gabriel Allon provides a deeper experience because it allows the reader to see how the character has developed over time.  But if you haven't read the earlier volumes, don't let that deter you from starting here.  

The book begins with a horrific bombing and Allon (talented art restorer and sometime Israeli secret agent) is assigned to find and kill those responsible.  The reader is invited along as Allon follows leads in Europe and the Middle East.  Silva provides us with his usual mix of excitement and plot twists and he makes the sights and sounds feel real.  In his descriptions of Egypt and Paris, I could see, hear and smell the places I had visited in the past.  Along the way, we watch as his protagonist struggles with both his love for two women and his guilt in his interactions with them.  

Readers will also see in this novel a primer about the complexity of the problems in the Mideast, shown through the eyes of an Israeli spy and the eyes of his Palestinian enemy.  There is plenty of action to move the book along quickly, but the author also helps the reader to see the pain that underlies all of the struggles between Israelis and Palestinians.   Highly recommended!
