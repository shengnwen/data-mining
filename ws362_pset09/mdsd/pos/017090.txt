"Battle Cry" is a book my daughter had bought me for my birthday two years ago.  Regrettably, it took me some time to begin reading it.  I found it a little hard to get into in the early chapters.  There were a lot of characters to keep track of, a la "Dr. Zhivago", and the narrative has slow periods.  I considered setting it aside a time or two.

But I kept with it, and over time it began to hook me.  The character development reminded me of "Lonesome Dove", and soon I became eager to get to the next page.  When I had 100 pages to go, I could not put it down.

I think that I will read it again, so that I can get more out of the slow spots.  This is where Leon Uris imparts a lot of the tedium and monotony of Marine life.  

I would recommend that any reader of historical fiction, action, and/or WWII read this book.  In fact, I should think it an essential for the libraries of any of the above.  In hindsight, I can say that I did thoroughly enjoy it.
