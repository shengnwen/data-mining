Whenever I buy something from Amazon I always check the customer reviews as I have found them very helpful.  That's why I was so surprised to see some of the reviews for this book that were so negative - a waste of time, etc.  What do these readers expect?  This is not Pulitzer Prize winning fiction.  These books are what I call "bodice busters" and they're meant to be fun.  That's exactly what they are.  I've read all the heavy books I want to and still do on occasion.  But mostly, when I read a novel, I want to be entertained and that's exactly what Catherine Coulter does.  So for my money the book was well worth it.  It passed the time, kept me interested and it was total escape.  Bravo Ms. Coulter, keep em coming!
