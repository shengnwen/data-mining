I liked the qualities of the general section of this book.  For those who  are looking for some insight that applies to today's world, you can find  some gems here.  I read The Art of War translated by Griffith and think  that this is much better.  The commentary is easier to follow and is  presented well.  The book gives examples of the principles it talks about  from The Three Kingdoms but doesnt always give the names of the people that  it talks about.  So for readers familiar with the Three Kindoms this can be  a little disappointing.  Otherwise its a good book to read
