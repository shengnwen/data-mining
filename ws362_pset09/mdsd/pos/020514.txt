This book is not bad. It is good for the basics of how to buy and sell on Ebay, if you have never done it, but if you have already been doing business on Ebay, its more of a review than revelation. There are a lot of great little 'tid-bits' of information and the writing style is entertaining, but nothing really eye opening or anything that makes you say hum....It talks about doing your homework and how to to post listings, the rules of ebay but  a lot of this is posted on the Ebay site itself. If you are a total novice by all means pick it up, but if you have done a few deals on Ebay and pretty much know your way around you may want to skip this one
