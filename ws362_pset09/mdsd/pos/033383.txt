While I'm not a Photoshop beginner, I certainly do not consider myself to be advanced. I've been struggling for several years to get my old slides to the point of just being okay.
I've spent a small fortune on DVDs and other tutorials and was beginning to think I'd never improve. Many so-called experts seem to try harder to be funny than to teach.
After working through the first four chapters of this book I can already see great improvement in my pictures. I'd give this book 5 stars.
