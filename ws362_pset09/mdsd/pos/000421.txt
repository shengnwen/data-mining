The Remains of the day is an imaginative, subtle evocation of the fallibilities of the self in its brave attempt to achieve meaning and understanding. It is a book that once you have finished it, you will feel the ambiguous feeling of sadness yet joy for the triumph of the main character. It is a novel full of highly admirable qualities.

The story is simple, Stevens, a butler in search of a familiar replacement for losses in his staff, embarks on a journey through the English countryside. Throughout this journey, as he encounters certain small obstacles and symbolic landscapes, he journeys through his thoughts as well, reflecting on his past, his achievements and and his failures.

The story is full of subtleties that may fly by you if you do not consider carefully during certain junctures of the book. Even though the premise of the novel is simple, the thoughts, ideals of the main character is not. He constantly argues and justifies the actions of his past - as it is interjected throughout his journey - and is vivacious at these, but soon you'll realise that he's not simply revisiting memories, but trying to understand himself. There are areas of his past where we sense deep regret, but it is never explicitly mentioned, or indirectly told.

A novel worthy of reading, this is a book that sensitively portrays how even the most genuine and steadfast of individuals can be prone to his own circumstance. It brims with poignance, understatement as the sad tapestry of a man with a simple life, hardened intellect and at the end of his prime, is painted
