Although lacking in adequate color plates as expressed by a previous reviewer, this text is wonderful in its description of  the history of the mural which took Sargent 30 years and was never completed probably because of the controversy arising out of how religion was viewed in public in 1919, a change from when  Sargent started it in 1890. The book describes the history of the mural in the context of its time of diverse social, cultural and religious matters.  After viewing the actual mural at the Boston Public Library, where it is, unfortunately, covered with dirt but is being restored and cleaned, one will be overwhelmed with this painting and find the book extremely interesting and full of important historical information, as well as understand why this mural is considered one of the most important pieces of public art
