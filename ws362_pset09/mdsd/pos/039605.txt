I enjoyed the fresh, pragmatic approach to applying common sense. Although familiar with many of the stories and examples from similar works, the Merrill's provide useful up-to-date examples for aligning important areas of life: Work, Family, Time, &amp; Money. Each section helps the reader identify what's in it for them along with the author's personal experience relating how they have incoporated their own ideas. Practical advice useful for anyone wishing to further calibrate their &quot;inner radar&quot; while helping to keep up with the balancing act of life itself
