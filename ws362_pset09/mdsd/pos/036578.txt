I enjoyed the book, especially the middle part (the majority of the story) about the first Celia and Stephen the monk.  They had a truly sad ending, my heart especially broke for the fate of Stephen.  Maybe it is just me, but the last part of the book just didn't flow well for me, but I can't put my finger on why.  All in all an enjoyable read, but it definitely isn't Katherine, which all lovers of historical fiction should read -- that one deserves 10 stars at least
