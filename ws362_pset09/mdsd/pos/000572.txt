 There is some who would say that Bill is a right wing gun waving nutcase like one reviewer below. But I just think he/she/it is a liberal dupe. There is also lots and I mean lots of conservative dupes. I'd say Bill is eccentric and some of this book is blather. To dismiss it on the whole because of a couple of space cadet ramblings would be wrong. There is concrete proof that there is a cabal of men in high places mainly the international bankers who are bent on world control and domination. Their arm is the unconstitutional private bank the Federal Reserve who has a strangle hold on the econmy and can cause recessions and depressions with edicts. Do your homework and you'll see the crash of 29' was no accident. The IRS is also illegal so is the income tax which is used to pay the interest on the debt to the international bankers. Now I don't know about the Illuminati  or Skull and Bones stuff but it is a big possibilty that their connected. This book covers it all. Not for establishment liberals or conservatives who wish to believe whats on the surface. This is for people like me who want to dig where the dirt, slime and worms are. As for Bill's death its up in the air there is a possibilty that the cops shot him because he shot first. Theres also the other that the authorites shot him as a undesirable and some say the court records concur with this. Either way this book is a good and informative read.
