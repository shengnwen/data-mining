Akhil Vyas is a freshman in high school, and is scarred and looks weird. The school gossipers, Alana and Kathy, talk harshly about Akhil, like he looks weird, and has been into too many razor blades. The National Institute of Health has been studying him, although he can't say why.

The ending is pretty sad because Akhil gets killed in a bomb that detonated in their school
