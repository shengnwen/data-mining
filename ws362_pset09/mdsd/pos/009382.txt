Although this book was published later in Gemmell's Drenai series, it is more or less a direct prequel to Legend. This book tells the story of how Druss became the legendary figure that we see defending the walls of Dros Delnoch in Legend. This book is a good place to jump into the Drenai series as it stands pretty well on its own. This has all of the action-packed fight scenes that you expect from David Gemmell, as well as characters that you really care about.

The plot of this book is divided into two parts. The first being Druss's quest to regain his young bride, Rowena. In this part of the book Druss is very young and not yet the legend we know. The second part takes place shortly before the events in Legend, Druss is an aging warrior, but still the mighty figure known throughout the land. The first part of the book is the bulk of the story, how Druss became the Legend. The second part serves as a bridge to Gemmell's other works.

One thing to keep in mind is that Druss is an unstoppable, indestructable force (would he be the legend if he wasn't?). At times in this book Druss charges into situations with impossible odds stacked against him and emerges victorious. If anyone is turned off by this superman-syndrome, you may want to give this one a pass.

I highly recommend this novel to anyone who is a fan of David Gemmell, or who loves fast-paced plot-driven fantasy! Gemmell is one of the greats
