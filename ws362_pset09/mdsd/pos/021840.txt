I found this book to be quite interesting but not at all what I had anticipated.  Based on the title, I expected to see an erudite tome analyzing the lives of Ronald Reagan and Winston Churchill culminating in a discussion of how great leaders, such as these, are "made."  I was, of course, being rather naïve, for if anyone knew how great leaders are produced they wouldn't be so rare in human history.  What I found, instead, was a side-by-side comparison of two great men with emphasis on the parallels in their careers; the manner in which they were viewed by their contemporaries and the media in their own times; their visionary natures; the constancy of their actions; and the many connections between them which can be drawn when their characters, actions, writings, speeches, and strangely enough their educations are closely examined.  

This latter point, their educations, may have come the closest to telling us how great leaders are created.  Both men, it would seem, were rather poor students in their early years, but both men spent most of the remainder of their lifetimes reading and writing and, in effect, educating themselves without any presumed experts to tell them that this or that theory or manner of thinking was incorrect.  In their solitude, much like Abraham Lincoln, they were left to decide for themselves what was right and what was wrong.   As a consequence, neither Reagan nor Churchill ended up conforming to the conventional wisdom of his time, with the result that neither one was fully understood nor appreciated during his political lifetime.  

This is an excellent book filled with little known, or at least little remembered, facts, anecdotes, quotes, and excerpts concerning two great statesmen.  The comparisons are many, with surprising similarities that do both men great honor.  Bottom line - This is a book well worth reading.  I highly recommend it, but don't expect what the title offers but the book fails to deliver.
