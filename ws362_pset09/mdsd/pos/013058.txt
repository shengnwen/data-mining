I found this book to be filled with very useful and valuable information about an aspect of my health that I hadn't really thought about, namely how "healthy" bacteria impact our health.  I think most people automatically think that bacteria are "bad."  In fact, "good" bacteria are as essential for our health as vitamins and minerals, maybe more so.  Although this book is filled with scientific information, I as a non-scientist found it very easy to understand and use.  Not only is the information presented very valuable, there is an excellent resource section in the book that helps you find even more information through books, websites, and companies.  I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in improving your health
