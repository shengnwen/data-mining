Hiaasen somehow sucks you into believing the most ridiculous things and being glad to go along for the ride.  Absolute absurdity simply becomes the milieu in which the least likely characters commit the most unreasonable acts, and you watch the parade with suspended logic.  My husband and I read these out loud, which more than doubles the enjoyment.  We laugh so much that it does slow things down.

Be aware that there is a real edge of anger (entirely justified) about corrupt politicians and rapacious land developers.  You also always get a flawed hero and a morally pure, but behaviorally challenged female. One more reason to read these books
