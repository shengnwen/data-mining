I purchased this book as a gift for a friend who lost his copy moving.  He learned to bake bread using this book many years ago and went on to become a professional baker.  I too had put in my time baking bread back in the seventies when my children were young; and looking through this bread book before I gave it away convinced me I need my own copy.  Suffice it to say the receipient had tears in his eyes when he opened his package
