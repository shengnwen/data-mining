I felt moved to add a review of Translations after reading several of the reviews other readers have left.  Brian Friel has  a feel for language that is nothing short of miraculous.  This play in particular is a delicate and wonderful portrait of the universality of human experience.  If you care enough to read these reviews you owe it to yourself to read this play.  I am a long time admirer of Mr. Friel and I saw a remarkable production of this play in London several years ago.  There are times - rare times - when a person leaves a theater and doesn't feel the ground under his feet because of the transport of the experience.  That was one such performance, and this is that fine a play
