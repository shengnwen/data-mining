The previous reviewer was annoyed at the size of this book and dismissed it as a "booklet", which to me sounds like a flimsy little pamphlet.  But I have it right here in front of me and it is a very substantial little "miniature book", something a lot of people enjoy collecting.  It is hardbound and 125+ pages long with lots of pictures and interesting tidbits by knitters about knitting.  It is not an encyclopedia or a textbook, just a nice little book you can carry in your pocket or purse, and flip through while you're riding home on the bus or standing in line at the post office.  And given the good quality of the binding and printing, I'd say $4.95 is a bargain
