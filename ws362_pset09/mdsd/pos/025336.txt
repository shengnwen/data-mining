This book was comforting in that it explains why some children are late talkers.  Often, there's a lack of understanding from parents and relatives on why children talk late.  Parents get blamed in a lot of these cases by people who don't understand that not all children are the same.  Whether your child is bright but talks late or whether your child talks late because of autism, you, the parent, need to find out.  If you want to learn some strategies you can use as a parent to communicate with your child, then I would recommend a book called More Than Words by Fern Sussman.
