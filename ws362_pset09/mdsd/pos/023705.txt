I received a taggie blanket at my baby shower and my daughter loves it, so when I saw this book I bought it.  She loves it, it as well.  I find this works well in the stroller or backback and she likes to chew on all the tabs (tho' mostly the information tag, as it is the biggest).  It cleans easily in the wash.  It isn't really much of a "story" -- this is mostly a book-shaped toy.  But she gives it lots of attention and it is a wonderful distraction for in the car or playpen.  My son, who is two years old, thinks the loops are funny and likes to stick his fingers in them, but this is really an item for a baby.  I don't imagine a toddler interested in real books would get much out of it
