Henry Lumpkin did a superb job detailing the battles leading to the close of the Revolutionary War. One of very few histories to mention/detail the massacre at the 1st Seige of Augusta (Sept 1780), his information clarified old family papers about my 6th great-grandfather's death there. This book is well-researched, easily read, very informative, descriptive, and cannot help but evoke emotion from its readers. Mr Lumpkin was quite successful in his discription of the viewpoints of the non-soldiers, the brother-against-brother, militiamen, Loyalists, Continental Army, the British, the trained officers, the untrained leaders, and the Native American's participation during their desparate fight for victory. This book is just different enough, it draws you into history as if it were happening now
