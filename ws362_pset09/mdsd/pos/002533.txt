When I read this book, the only other works of Elie Wiesel that I read were those from The Night Trilogy.  The Town Beyond the Wall is a bit of a departure from those three stories.  You see more optimism in this work, though this only becomes obvious towards the end.  The language is more poetic and really sucks you into the protagonist's world
