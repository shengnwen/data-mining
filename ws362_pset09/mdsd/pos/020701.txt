Its amazing how many years he struggled financially before he made a more steady income.  It was really cool to read about someone's life that was so incredibly different from anyone's life that I know personally.  All I know is you get a degree, in anything, from anywhere, and you work full time, end of story.  It seems like so many famous actors get their break instantly just by being related to someone else who's a famous actor.  Like Steven Tyler's daughters - that's just NOT fair. 

This book was very entertaining and well written.  The entire thing was quite interesting and really opened my eyes to what real actors have to go through just to do what they love.
