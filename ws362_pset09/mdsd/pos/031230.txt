This book reflects well a great deal of the journey I've travelled and the things that have been taught to me through painful experience, open and honest discussion with spritually focused friends, and oodles of diverse theological and spiritual readings and studies. 

It captures wonderfully many of my sentiments and much wisdom. I highly recommend it.
