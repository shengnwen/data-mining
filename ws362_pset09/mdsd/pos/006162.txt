Obviously the guy who said "real real real real horrendously unspeakably bad" doesn't know Bukowski.I thought the book was hilarious and sometimes it was the only thing that could make me laugh all day.It was the first book I've ever read by Bukowski but it instantly made me a fan.Since then I've read many of his other books and this one is still my favorite
