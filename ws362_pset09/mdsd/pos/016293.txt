This was an excellent series, but this final book (but I hope there are more to come)was the best.  We get tid-bits of Kane and Sherra's relationship in all the previous books (Tempting the Beast, The Man Within, and even Elizabeth's Wolf)and the build-up was fantastic.  This book did not disappoint on emotions and sensuality, promised in the other books.  Even though Elizabeth's Wolf is still my favorite Leigh book (maybe because it was my first), this is a close second.  You must read at least Tempting the Beast before you read this book though.  

Lora Leigh is hot, hot, hot.  This is not for those looking for a vanilla, sweet romance novel (go read a Julie Garwood if you do)
