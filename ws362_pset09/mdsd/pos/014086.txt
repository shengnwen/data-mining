Kubler-Ross shares with us her life's work experiences with death and dying persons and how dealing with our own death parallels with our everyday life choices.  Death comes to us in small ways everyday.  There are many things in life that we have to die to, inner growth depends on  this.  Dying to small things prepares us for the moment of bodily death.   Our ego for one thing is the hardest to die to, how we love to be right   and not give in to someone else's opinion, how we love to be recognized for  our work, our successes,  our education, our money, our home, cars etc.  To  let go of our ego takes a lifetime but it is well worth the effort and  gives you acceptance and peace of soul.  The practice of letting go in  small things prepares you for the bigger decisions of life.  Your life  becomes less petty and more human, less superficial and more realized, less  important and more compassionate.  It is not an easy lesson but one worth  working through the stages of death and dying.  Victor Frankl in his book  "Man's Search for Meaning" also show how finite is our existence.  Anthony  DeMello in his book Sadhana:  Way to God reveals how important it is to  detach ourselves from desire and also the Dalai Lama lives a life full of  compassion although he has been exiled from his own country for over 35  years.  To be or not to be that is the question
