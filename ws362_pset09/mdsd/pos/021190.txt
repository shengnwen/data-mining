As a professor at the State University of New York--Plattsburgh, I'm always looking for new case studies and ideas to share with my undergraduate students.  The book clearly demonstrates what professionals  in various fields are doing to improve structures within different  contexts.  Having worked with various non-profit organizations, this  resource guide is useful both as a practioner and observer of  organizational communication.  Each of the proposed interventions clearly  define, describe and apply techniques that could definitely improve  communication within the workplace. I'm especially fond of the resources  and references included at the end of each intervention
