As a Ph. D in Sexuality and a marriage counselor, I strive to use only the very best advice, research and practices currently available. I am pleased to share that "The secrets of happily married men" is definitely one of the best books so far on achieving and maintaining a blissful marriage or close relationship. 

I liked very much that the approach of this exceptional book is practical. This separates it from several other books that mostly discuss various related topics but are of little practical help. I would like to applaud Haltzman for coming up with 8 specific techniques that as far as I can see from clients' feedback work and help them a lot. 

I also agree that men are biologically, mentally and emotionally quite different compared to women and it is also rare to find an author who does not talk down on men and believes that they have to be "fixed" as if there is something wrong with them. That's why I am sure that men will highly appreciate the tone, expertise and great depth of the provided information. Allow me also to highly recommend as a perfect pair the bestseller "Scientfically guaranteed multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" by scientist Ritz because it delivered great value and results to my marriage and to all of my clients. I dare say that both books will dramatically improve your marriage for better!
