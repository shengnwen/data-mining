There are few novelists as articulate as Ian McEwan. In THE CHILD IN TIME, McEwan frequently uses this great gift to lift the perfect observation from familiar situations so that a reader reacts: "Yes, that is exactly so." Or, his articulateness breaks down a moment--a quick progression of moods, for example--so that a reader can identify the swell, surge, and flood of emotion that initiates, say, honest mourning. With McEwan, this articulateness achieves moments of poetic realism that are on a par with the best writing of John Updike. It's absolutely great!

Even so, the psychology of McEwan's characters can be unfamiliar in THE CHILD IN TIME, sometimes veering into the strange terrains of depression, madness, or extra-dimensional experience. Or, his characters may embody an element of an argument that the articulate McEwan, master of this universe, decides to examine and build into the flow. Then, the articulate and persuasive McEwan crashes against stonewall of my skeptical common sense. 

Regardless, read the spellbinding THE CHILD IN TIME and watch Stephen Lewis take the blow and then heal emotionally after the kidnapping and disappearance of his wee daughter. An excellent read and highly recommended!
