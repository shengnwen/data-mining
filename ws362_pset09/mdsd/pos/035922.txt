Good Faeries Bad Faeries is a book that closely resembles Faeries, the classic book in the field of fantasy art, and is done by Brian Froud, one of the contributors to that fine book. Along with that, Terri Windling did the editing of Good/Bad, and her previous success as an editor surely adds to the power of this book.

Good Faeries Bad Faeries is a flip book that separates itself into two categories, the good and the bad side of faeries, thus the title. Each section has its own atmosphere with creatures lavishly painted to reflect their personalities. Unlike Faeries, though, this book doesn't explore the world of these creatures, only the fantastical pixies, sprites, goblins, and imps that inhabit that world. What it does do though and describe the properties of the faeries in this book, and all of the creatures are based on popular myth, so it's very difficult to find something that isn't at least familiar by name.

Beyond that, Brian Froud's great style was presented gloriously in this book. Though Alan Lee's contribution to the book Faeries was huge, Brian Froud was the better of the two, at least in my opinion, and it was nice to see what Froud could do on his own. Despite that, the book just isn't original anymore. It was done a long time ago and many times since then. Its saving grace was the illustrator and editor involved.

I'd recommend this book to fans of fantastical art or those of you who enjoyed Faeries or any other Brian Froud/Alan Lee compilation. It's a solid work of fantasy art that shouldn't be ignored by fans of such things
