As a Holistic Practitioner, I recently became interested in what some have called &quot;vibrational medicine&quot;. I found Beaulieu's unique observations into the world of sound, music and healing to be thrilling and his views have urged me to continue looking into the realm of sound. I have adopted some of his tenets into my consulting work. Information on voice energetics was most interesting; combining physiology with energy concepts, as was the chapter on tuning forks. A great read
