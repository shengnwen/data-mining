I read and completed the exercises in THE ARTIST WAY about ten years ago--and it changed my life. I'm an admitted self-help junkie, but Julia Cameron goes way, way beyond the typical self-help hype. Her words resonate like a tuning fork against my sternum. 
I read WALKING IN THIS WORLD curled up in a hotel room on a business trip and each night I would read her words and know that this was exactly what I needed, and at the time in my life when I was ready for the next leg of my journey. As a woman, an artist, and a writer, continuing to find my creativity is vital and Julia Cameron delivers yet again.
