The book would be a lot more useful to me if Swain did more showing and less talking about what he does. Its a glaring defect because people learn differently, and I require demonstrations to get it. In fairness, however, few writing teachers do as well as Swain. The book is a good addition to my toolbox; it just isnt excellent or a revelation.
