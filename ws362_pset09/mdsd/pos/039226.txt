This book was well researched, and provides an entertaining and enlightening insight into an era that could not exist since the civil rights movement of the 60's.   It speaks to social justice and inclusion, bias and the ability to transcend existing norms to earn a living at a time when, for black America, second class citizenship and economic hardship were the norm.  Mr. Watkins is the professor and we are his students
