The Stupid Stupid Rat Tails is a excellent comic book. I love the way Jeff Smith draws. I have read all his Bone books and Stupid Stupid Rat Tails and I have never been disapointed or let down. I have become one of his biggest fans. The talking monkey Mr Pip is truthfull, I love his wit. The baby creatures of the forest whos parents were ate by the Rat creature queen are cute and cuddley. I just love this comic book
