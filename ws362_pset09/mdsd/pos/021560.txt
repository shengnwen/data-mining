Back cover reads:
A POWERFUL MAN CAN MAKE A WOMAN STRONGER...
OR BREAK HER HEART.
Nicole Seymour had lost at love before--a first marriage that was such a fiasco she never even had a proper wedding night. The Kane Lombard strolled down a South Carolina beach and into her heart. Here their pasts seemed very far away, and all that mattered was discovering was how much they cared for each other. But both were keeping secrets. "Beach bum" Kane was actually a wealthy Houston oil man, whose family owned the tabloid newspaper that was digging up dirt of Nikki's U.S. Congressman brother. Nikki, the laughing, innocent woman of Kane's dreams, was really the elegant, glittering Charleston socialite sister of his bitterest enemy. All too soon lies and political intrigue made them angry opponents. Their passion would become a two edged sword-a hunger that brought them together and a searing pain that drove them apart. And Nikki Seymour would become a woman in love with the one man she should never trust.
