If I Should Die before I Wake by Han Nolan is a heartbreaking novel about a sixteen-year-old named Hilary. Hilary hates Jews. But, as fate would have it, after a terrifying motorcycle accident with her boyfriend, Hilary lies dying in a Jewish hospital. She starts slipping in and out of reality, and is bombarded by dreams from another place, time and person. She becomes Chana, a Polish Jew during the Holocaust. After her father's death at the hands of the Nazis, she gets caught up in a roundup and is transported to the Lodz ghetto with the rest of her family. Many do not survive there, but those who do get sent to the mass gassings of Auschwitz. The scent of death lingers, and Chana can't run or hide from the looming red sky, while Hilary is flung into memories of her shattered past. I really liked this book because it kept switching between the visions of Hilary and Chana. It was also very descriptive and you can see changes in the characters as the story progresses. It's not a very happy book, and so if you want something that will make you cry, this could be a possible outlet for your tears. This story of two broken lives that somehow intertwine despite their differences will teach you so much about strength of character, and strength of heart
