I spent a week in Boston and this book was great in helping me plan that trip. It offers lots of suggestions by region of the city which was a great way to plan. The restaurant recommendations were excellent and it is always fun to see what they recommend as the regional dishes.  For those looking to soak up the history, culture and fun of Boston this is a great book to use in planning that trip.
