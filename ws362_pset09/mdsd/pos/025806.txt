Perhaps the best book on James Bond in the cinema since Steven Jay Rubin's excellent 1983 long-out-of-print work THE JAMES BOND FILMS: A BEHIND THE SCENES HISTORY (any true fans Bible), this large format book covers the James Bond movies up until 2002's DIE ANOTHER DAY choosing to concentrate on some of the cultural and current events that helped shape the transformation of the character over his 40-year cinematic career.
With many rare and previously unseen photo's the authors show the depth of their research through the comprehensive coverage not only of the influences on the movies, but also coverage of the influence the movies (especially those of the 1960s) had on popular culture. Its an astoundingly comprehensive book and not one that can be lightly flipped through in one sitting. It's large scale makes it somewhat cumbersome but this handsome, elegant edition is so brimming with artwork and illustrations that its scale becomes a blessing, that can for the most part be forgiven.
It's in its different approach to THE JAMES BOND FILMS that LEGACY really makes an excellent companion piece. Whereas the previous work concentrated on the behind the scenes stories for each movie (as its sub-head suggests) this book encompasses influence and the movies in broad strokes. Obviously big fans of Bond themselves they offer few criticisms of the movies themselves and scarce information on the anecdotal information that Rubin supplies.
Overall a sumptuous, elegant edition on the James Bond series that belongs in the bookshelves of every self discerning 007 fans.
Now, here's hoping Rubin updates his book soon
