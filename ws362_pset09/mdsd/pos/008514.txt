I found this series of lectures an insightful and fascinating read. I knew nothing about the subject beforehand, but now I feel I have a solid understanding of the basic ideas of Romanticism, how they were a contrast to the Enlightenment, and how they evolved. I only wish I had been able to hear these lectures when they were presented.
