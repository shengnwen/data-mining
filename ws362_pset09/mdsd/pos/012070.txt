These are my unprofessional impressions of the story:

1) Characters are personable; realistic (flawed). I found myself empathizing with the questionable ones and angered by some of the 'good' ones.
2) The book is divided into 3 slices of the life of Maris, the main character, and contrasts nicely the differences between tradition and (r)evolution without getting moralistic or preachy. There is no final opinion given as to which way of life was better for Windhaven, so you are left to think and decide for yourself.
3) The pace of the book is good, until the last part. It feels a bit redundant at times and takes away some of the momentum that was built from the first parts -- but it accomplishes its purpose to bring the story to a close.
4) The prose is easy to read; the experience is not bogged down with unnecessary verbiage.

You'll never know if you're going to like the story unless you try reading it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes stories set in non-existent worlds and doesn't need constant action or buildup to keep their interest going
