This revised edition of Dr. Owen-Crocker's 1986 book does not disappoint.  It incorporates vast amounts of new research, archaeological material, and reenactor feedback and includes many more illustrations as well as reconstruction sketches and intelligent discussion of the available evidence for Anglo-Saxon costume between the fifth and eleventh centuries.  A must-have reference for any Anglo-Saxon scholar, as well as for anyone with a serious interest in northern European costume during the so-called "Dark Ages.
