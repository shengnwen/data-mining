What a moving account of someone on "the inside" of the world of veterinary medicine. If anyone cannot be touched at the love and compassion of these "angels of mercy" working in the field of animals who are not only ill, but know will never recover, I would hate to believe it. But they have the best kind of love of all - they know the one they love is not going to be around "forever". They are willing to take the chance of being hurt by losing someone they love. And, if we will admit it, that is true of all love. They go into this with their eyes wide open, as should we, knowing that the time we have with those we love is temporary, and we must cherish and make the most of that time.
