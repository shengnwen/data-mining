Sir Arthur Conan Doyle this isn't, but nonetheless the book does manage to entertain the reader for its duration quite well. Although it does follow the standard Sneaky Pie Brown construction, the actual mystery is really little more than a vehicle for the inspired, witty commentary of the animals that inhabit Brown's Crozet, VA. The book is enjoyable for the one-liners, and teasing dialogue between the all the characters, but the mystery is of little challenge, (and should have been more easily resolved by the characters within). Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable read
