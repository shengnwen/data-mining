I think this book was really good.  In this book Mr. Lamb showed the other side of the story about Vietnam.  He showed what they think about the whole war, and what they think about American people.  By Mr. Lamb's words, the book showed that Hanoi is a beautiful city in Vietnam, and that Vietnamese people are not mad at Americans for what happend, they say that they are people just like us.  I do recommend this book, because it's nice to know what the other side thinks about the war
