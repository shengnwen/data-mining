After taking a seminar in Opening a Bed and breakfast, I found this book to be very informative and influential in my decision of opening my own Bed and Breakfast soon.  Realizing it will take a few years to get it up and  running successfully, I know that this will be my goal and I feel I will be  very successful in this endeavor with the help of my husband
