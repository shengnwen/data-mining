For a one-day snapshot in the life of neurosurgeon Henry Perowne, "Saturday" covers a lot of ground.  From an unexpectedly early awakening, to a fiercely competitive game of squash, to a run-in with demented street thugs, to a family get-together gone horribly awry, to a late-night surgical procedure, Mcewan transforms the ordinary into the transcendent in a way that reminds me of Updike's best work. 

Terrorism, evolutionary theory, genetic predeterminism, art, socio-economic strata, parenting, and mortality all take their turns on stage, with Mcewan's brilliant prose teasing universal truths from this utterly realistic microcosm he's created.  Seen through the eyes of a perfectly-drawn character whose profession is known for its God complexes, Perowne's realization that his Saturday is coming to a close and that he, like any mere mortal, had better prepare for the coming Sunday in his life, resonates perfectly.

For me, genre fiction is where much of today's most interesting writing can be found, yet this novel serves as proof that certain literary fiction can both entertain and enlighten.
