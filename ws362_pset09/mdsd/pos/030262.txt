This is a superb work of catholic scholarship and reflection. Catholic religious communities are living traditions, not museums, and the way they experience and understand women now is not what it was 500 or 1,000 years ago. Dr. Johnson repeatedly demonstrates that devotion does not require religious people to be blind to change, development, or maturation. Nor does it mean that they should cling to fantasy instead of reality.

The glory of Catholic theological reflection in the past has been its belief (which I share) that if something is not real, it can't be sacred. This book pursues the reality of what it must have meant to be Mary, and what Mary means now, with reverence and grace. 

It is silly to imagine that true catholic, orthodox, or christian reverence regarding Mary's unique place in the communion of saints requires us to pretend that nothing of any note has happened in human history over the past 500 years. That does not seem to be the sort of thing that Mary herself would recommend or countenance.
