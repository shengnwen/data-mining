I got hooked on this calendar several years ago, and every Christmas I get one for myself and several for certain friends who now expect this each year. The photography is outstanding, and the historical perspective offered on each month is very informative. Something new that was contained in the 2007 calendar is postcards of each of the teapots of the 12 months. These are not just photos of teapots, but are beautiful table settings of foods, flowers, linens, and keepsakes of the era when the particular teapot was produced. The photos conjure up a time when people gathered to talk and eat delectable finger foods and relax in a way that perhaps we do not enjoy today. From that aspect the calendar has a very nurturing quality. The antique teapots are quite amazing and beautiful
