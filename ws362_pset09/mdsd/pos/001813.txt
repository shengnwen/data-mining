Many people feel that this play of Shakespeare's is either unfinished or a poor effort. But I do not think this is accurate or fair. The reality is that many people can never find a middle ground. It is actually (in my opinion) quite common for people to only be able to see things from one  extreme or the other. Despite Apemantus' cynical nature, there is no  denying that whatever his faults are, HE DOES HAVE RIGHT ON HIS SIDE when  he tells Timon: &quot;The middle of humanity thou never knewest,/ but the  extremity of both ends....&quot; (4.3.342-343). Critics also tend to think  Apemantus is unlikable, but are we missing a crucial point? I can not help  but think Shakespeare is commenting on the fact that more people DON'T have  a concept of reality. Apemantus refuses to join in the delight when Timon  thinks highly of his false friends. Apemantus is aware of reality and no  one wants to hear it. In my opinion Timon and Apemantus are VERY TRUE to  life. In addition, the roll of Flavius is very touching. He can not dessert  his master even when he knows (or thinks) Timon has nothing. Finally, I can  not over estimate the mastery of Shakespeare when first Timon has money, he  can not do enough for his so called friends and when he has nothing they  dessert him. When Timon through fate gains a second fortune, he does not  turn back into what he was, but rather he uses his 2nd fortune to destroy  Athens. It is interesting that Shakespeare derived this play on the legend  of 'Timon the Manhater,' and decides to take it a step further and show how  he got there. And how much more realistic could Shakespeare have made this  than by first showing Timon as a 'manlover?' Many people feel Timon should  have somehow found the middle of humanity, but if he had, that would have  defeated the whole purpose of this excellent play
