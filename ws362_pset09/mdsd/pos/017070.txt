The New McGraw Hill Telecom Factbook  2d Edition by Joe Pecar  and Dave Garbin is one of the best reference books I have ever used.It is long overdue and a must have reference on your shelf. It addresses subjects that other  authors  seem to treat only slightly  if at all. The authors ability to explain complex subject s  in a clear easily understandable manner is unique. The many illustrations and diagrams are usable by both lay persons and engineers alike.  This would have been an excellent text to have had available for my college courses. This book is a key reference in my program office and I continually need to add more copies.I recommend the reading and use of this factbook to all professionasl and laymen alike who are serious about understanding the modern complex world of Telecommunications and Information Systems.
