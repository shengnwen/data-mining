The Education of a Bodybuilder is one of the greatest books I've read. Obviously it's in no comparison to say MacBeth or something like that, but it is as entertaining as it is educational. In the first portion of the book Arnold tells his life story of how he got into bodybuilding, his trial and error process, and ultimately leads up to his first Olmpia win. There are many great stories in between that make both for a good laugh, and also serve as motivation. Secondly, there is a section in the middle that has many of his photos from various contests, teen-Olmypia's. The last part of the book is an intro to certain styles of lifting and techniques, followed by some programs/splits to use as you progress. Overall, I'de say it's the best book I've ever read but that may be because I idolize Arnold and respect the work ethnic he had to become in my eyes the greatest bodybuilder of all time. Either way, I think anyone even semi-interested in exercise, bodybuiling or even a good read will thoroughly enjoy it
