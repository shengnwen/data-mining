Donna and her young daugher Cindy are on the run.  The monster pursuing them is Roy, Donna's ex-husband, who was arrested after the horrendous things he did to Cindy.  But in fleeing Roy, Donna finds herself in Malcasa Point, home of Beast House, the legendary site of several murders and now a tourist attraction.  Also in Malcasa Point is Jud, who has come with one of Beast House's two survivors.  He's come to kill the beast that reportedly lives in the house.  Naturally, Jud is skeptical. So is Donna, of course.  But soon she and Jud will be forced to face the fact that Roy is not the only monster on their trail...and that some monsters are definitely NOT human...

"The Cellar" is definitely not Laymon's best, probably because it's an early one.  It is, however, better than the rest of the recent Leisure re-issues (probably because many of the recent re-issues were never meant to be published).  It's gruesome and gory fun; there's not much substance here, as there is to Laymon's latter-day work ("The Traveling Vampire Show" is a fine example of Laymon's great character-development, if you're interested in that).  However, it's still a fast, fun read. Maybe not the best initiation to Laymon; however, if you like your horror raw and gritty, pick this one up
