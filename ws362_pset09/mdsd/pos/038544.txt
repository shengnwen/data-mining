Just based on the title there could be some confusion. This is infact a tool for finding a ministry. Be that as it may, it's a tool more designed for Theology students to pick just which part of the field they're looking to go into. Granted most in ministries who will use this book will be looking for paid positions it doesn't make this book a general career finder.
Going by just the title you'd think this could be a book to help anyone find their career in anything. It's not. It's more specific then that. But hey, that's why us avid book readers read the books description, right!?
All in all it's a fairly helpful book if you need clarification on the path of ministry you are choosing. However, if you're trying to decide between computer science and teaching, well, a better book would be 'What Color is your Parachute'
