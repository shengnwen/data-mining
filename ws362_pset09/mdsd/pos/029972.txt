From my personal days of retail, our motto was increase sales everything else will follow.  Honestly, this is a short sided method of trying to increase profits.  Slywotzky has one evaluate where is the market going, who should your customers be, where is the value migrating towards, so you can be more effective in business.  Slywotzky presents a very well thought out method of looking at your business or a potential business and asking those probing questions that seperate you from your competitors.
He offers a variety of business models as well as profit models.  All are valid, and hybirds are suggested, but the point is to know what you are driving towards, and develop your strategy after this.  I have read many different business books, and this one has to be one of my favorite.  If you enjoyed Built to Last or from Good to Great, you will like the depth this book has to offer.
