It is about time that someone has had the courage to stand up and say what he believes about integrity in the world today.  Stephen Carter does a good job of posing questions that provoke thought upon a subject that is generally avoided because people like to fool themselves into thinking that they are living a life of integrity.  Carter points out how often, in everyday situations, people show that they have not sat down and contemplated their actions before they do something that could make them look bad later.  He shows have many people &quot;shoot first and ask questions later&quot;  rather than thinking about what is important enough to stand behind and what isn't.  A word of warning though, don't read this book unless you are prepared to look at your own life of &quot;integrity.&quot
