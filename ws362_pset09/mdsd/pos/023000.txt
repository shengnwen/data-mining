I read this book to children in first grade and they LOVED IT!!  The children thought that this book was so hilarious.  The book did such a great job incorporating money and counting into it.  The illustrations were awesome as well, the pictures kept the children's attention while I was reading the book.  I kept a tally of how much the pigs found and where they found the money.  The children loved helping me keep track and they all participated in naming all the different locations of where the pig family kept the money.  I do recommend this book for a circle or group reading, the children will love it!!
