When reviewing something, I believe it is important to review both the manufacturing quality of the product and the artistic merit (I use this term very loosely because, of course, it is unfair to compare all products to Renaissance masterpieces).

Runaways is manufactured quite well; the product is sturdy, the cover has a nice, glossy finish, and the pages are all of very high quality.

Artistically, the comic is very nice. I enjoyed the volume much, and will be buying more of this series. Other review probably review the material much better than myself, so I will merely say that the comic is accessible to all age groups. It will not be a waste of time by any means if you buy and read this comic
