Bernard Fall's classic on the First Indochina War is useful not only for the excellent historical account it provides of the French experience in the war, but also in its later importance to American commanders in Vietnam. Some reviewers, and even prominent Vietnam vets like Colin Powell have pointed to the failure of American commanders to learn the lessons of the French debacle in Vietnam as being instrumental in the United States's withdrawl from the country in 1973. It is important to understand however, that for the most part this failure was not due to an ignorance of Fall's work. Indeed, the reason Fall's book is still in print today is because Street Without Joy was widely reaad by American military leaders in Vietnam, including LTC Hal Moore, COL Joseph Bellino and many others down to the company level (epsecially infantry and transportation officers). Despite what some reviewers have said, the Americans learned the lessons of Fall's work fairly well: one need only look at the creation and use of hardended convoys(guntrucks, air cav escorts), the wide use of air support, and the employment of helicopter-borne troops to see that American officers benefited greatly from Bernard Fall's work. The US forces in Vietnam did not have any Dien Bien Phu's, Street Without Joys or Groupement Mobile 100's/42's. Indeed as one American general pointed out to a North Vietnamese counterpart during the Paris Peace Negotiations in 1973, the Americans never lost a major battle to the NVA or VC during nearly ten years of war. But, of course, as the Vietnamese general rightly pointed out, that fact it made little difference since the United States lost the war politically both at home and in South Vietnam. This where Fall's work fails to effecively grasp the root problem of the French experience: even if the the French had dominated the battlefield as the Americans were able to after them, they could not overcome the image of being seen as colonial oppressors, and therefore could not succesfully wipe out the  widspread and fanatical political and nationalist insurgency they faced. The US would similarly fail in this manner as well, making their battlefield success moot
