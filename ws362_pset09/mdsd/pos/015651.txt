When I need to search within myself and better understand my relationship with God, I venture to the part of my bookshelf that holds Rabbi Harold Kushner's books. 

We all want to live a life that matters. This is a guide book of suggestions that are helpful in finding purpose in our "every day lives".

Thank You, Rabbi.
