Other reviewers have really given this book a bum rap. True, the layout is a bit confusing--a better world map, along with appropriate cross-references by geographic location, would have been helpful--but it is filled with quite a lot of useful and realistic travel destinations.

You child may not be up to visiting Mount Fuji or the D-Day beaches. Then again, maybe she or he will! I told my child to Verdun (recommended in this book) at age six, and the stark cost and meaning of modern war has stayed with him. Personally, I think the author deserves kudos for urging parents to aim high--to destinations that have genuine cultural and educational value--rather than just spouting the putrid Disneyworld-type destinations that far too many families consider to be appropriate family travel.

That said, unlike Patricia Schultz's 1,000 Places to See Before You Die (which reviewers, for some arcane reason, seem to love), the destinations recommended in this book are almost all within the normal financial range of the average middle-class family. Moreover, for those with less adventurous tastes, it contains plenty of museums and other mainstream kid-friendly destinations. For family travel off the beaten track, I highly recommend this book.
