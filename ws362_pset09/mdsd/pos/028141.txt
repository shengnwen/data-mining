I like how this book easily classifies people into distancers, and pursuers.  It is fairly easy to see where someone falls in terms of being a distancer and a pursuer.  From knowing this, determines how you should better communicate with your partner.  Now while this book does not suggest dramatic change over night, it does suggest making small changes that can make large results.
I also like that she doesn't set the reader up to expect dramatic changes from the other person.  She suggests in how to better communicate with the other person, whether it is your partner, parent, or child.  Then she also teaches you to set some boundaries, and make sure you take good care of yourself first.
I like this realistic approach to relationships.  The knowledge in this book can apply to many different types of relationships, do you don't have to have a significant other to benefit from this book.  Its well worth the read
