I finished "Entries & Exits" (Actually, I read it twice) and enjoyed it on so many levels.  It was a great opportunity for insight into a diverse group of traders and I was especially struck by the unique blend of methods used by this group of successful traders.  What is consistent is the commitment to personal growth, independent thinking, and seeing trading as a business with both fascinating and mundane aspects as with most businesses.  The interviews with Sherry and Diane struck a chord as so few women make it into print in the trading literature.

 

I will admit to previously feeling a little guilty about using Dr. Elder's Impulse system within a shorter time frame.  It felt somehow disloyal to give the weeklies a cursory glance and use 2 or 3 day charts for a longer term context.  After reading the book, I can see that my system must fit my trading goals, account size, personality... and incorporating Dr Elder's systems to give a better result is a compliment to him and his amazing work over many years.
