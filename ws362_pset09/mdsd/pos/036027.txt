Do you like books about young people meeting other people from other countries? Reading Jamie Gilson Hello, My Name Is Scrambled Eggs will help you do just that. The main character, Harvey, and his family had to bring a family from another country in their home.  The family that had to live with Harvey and his family were a family from Vietnam.   He was so happy to  have someone of his own age living with him.  Harvey had to bring him to  his school, and there the boy would have to go to school everyday. The boy  becomes a good friend with Harvey.  Harvey would help the boy speak better  English.  What I enjoyed about the book was when Harvey would teach the boy  about English on the computer.  Another part of the book that I enjoyed was  when Harvey started to become better friends with the boy and his family.   I think someone should read this book if someone was interested in seeing  how it is like to have someone from another country living with him or her  and what they were going through. I also believe that if someone was to  being someone into his or her home, that person should participate in the  family's beliefs. The person should also participate in activities that the  family enjoys. Harvey helped the boy very much to understand the English  language.  The boy would also participate in the activities that the  Harvey's family had done with him.  The boy liked where he lived as well as  Harvey having a new friend living with him.  I would also let someone from  another country live with my family and I do understand what it would be  like to live in a different place
