This is the first of Finder's novels I've read, but it won't be the last. Jason Steadman is a reasonably talented salesman for a high-tech consumer electronics firm in Boston who has risen to mid-level management -- but probably won't be going any farther. He's too easygoing, relatively speaking, lacking the taste for blood that his superiors expect. Also, his wife, who comes from an ex-wealthy background (her father drank away the family fortune), seems to think she's entitled to the lifestyle she used to have. So how far will Jason go in breaking through the promotion ceiling? Then he gets in a one-car accident and becomes acquainted with the ex-Special Forces sergeant who's driving the tow truck. Kurt Semko was bounced out of the service with a Dishonorable Discharge, which is keeping him from being hired for a better job, but Steadman foolishly recommends him for a corporate security position. And Semko intends to return the favor by supporting Jason's career in every way possible, even when that means underhanded tactics and breaking the law. Worse, Semko makes it clear that while he can be a valuable friend, he can also be a dangerous enemy. Finder does a good job setting the scene -- although what he intends as satire of the sales "personality" is often much closer to the truth, in my experience -- and his characters are fully developed. This is another novel with the potential to be a good film
