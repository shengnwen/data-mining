I do not aim with my hand.
He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I aim with my Eye.

I do not shoot with my hand.
He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I shoot with my Mind.

I do not kill with my hand.
He who kills with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I kill with my Heart.

The major thing I don't understand is why in every version of the cover art, Blane is depicted as an old-west style train, when he's a ultramodern monorail in the book?  Five star writing quality, but I have to take something off for the incongruity of the artwork
