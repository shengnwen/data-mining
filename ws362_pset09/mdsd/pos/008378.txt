What does 'evolutionism' have to do with the science of evolution? Not much -- no more than alchemy has to do with the science of chemistry, or astrology has to do with the science of astronomy. In each case, one is a valid science, while the other is a set of value-laden extrapolations and interpolations.

This book sketches the history of both -- evolutionary science and evolutionism -- and how they do and do not interrelate. Ruse is careful not to elide the distinction as he draws it out with his usual clarity, but as at least one reviewer has noted, the anti-science crowd will find ways to construe Ruse as saying evolutionary science is just another creed
