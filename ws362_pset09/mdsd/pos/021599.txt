A lot of information to digest for the new homeschooler.  One area that I either missed or it was not covered was how to transistion a child from public school to homeschooling (mid-year).  Homeschooling was not really an option at the beginning of the school year, but circumstances arose that lead to the decision not quite half way through the year (6th grade).  

I skipped around the book from section to section as I had questions and needed answers.  

I can't compare this book to any other on the subject because it is the only one I have read.  I have also used on-line sources to answer questions, but all-in-all, it's a pretty good reference to getting started.
