 This fiery red-headed tomboy has many adventures during her eleven-year-old life. She is afraid of nothing and plays all day with her brothers Tom and Warren. Caddie is always being pestered by her mother to become and lady. Caddie loves being able to run free and wild but she discovers a little longing to be like her sisters, who sew and cook all day. Her father just encourages and loves her being a tomboy. This story is set in Wisconsin in 1864 where many things happen. The little steamer comes in with the news, the circuit rider comes about once a year, cousin Annabelle visits, and a letter with a foreign letter comes for Caddie's father. 
  My favorite part in this book is when cousin Annabelle comes to visit and they play many tricks on her, but every time  Annabelle just picks herself right back up like a lady. Only one time did Annabelle get bent out of shape was when something "squishy" was put down her dress. 
  I think the theme of this book is to just be yourself and don't let others try to influence you. Caddie is a tomboy and she will always be one no matter how hard people try to change her.
  I think this book was very good. It was well written and had a good vocabulary. Caddie Woodlawn intrigued you and kept you reading because you want to know what happens. This book is all about Caddie Woodlawn and her adventures and they sure are interesting.
  I recommend this book to young to middle age teenage girls. They will enjoy this book because it is about a girl. But, it is also about a young girl being who she wants to be. It is a very fun book to read
