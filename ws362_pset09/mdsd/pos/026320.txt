 I recommend this book, Joey Pigza. Loses control. It is funny and at times touching. It's the kind of book that makes you turn the page because it is so interesting. The story is about a 12 year-old boy, named Joey, who goes to his father's house over summer vacation. Joey and his dog, Pablo, join his father's baseball team. He becomes the pitcher and discovers his unknown talent. Read the book to see what happens next...
