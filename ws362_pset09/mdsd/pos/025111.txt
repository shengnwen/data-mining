Berger's To the Wedding magically extends the author's critical vision which he has elaborated in both Ways of Seeing and On Looking.  In those essay collections, Berger establishes himself as a champion of creative looking - looking as a way of gleaning knowledge, beauty and understanding.  To the Wedding is narrated by a blind peddler of tamata, stamped metal charms, who is tied to two of his customers, a father and daughter, by a gift of intimate vision.  He is the omniscient narrator, a blind man who has a keen cinematic sense, and his focus is on the unfolding life of the daughter, Ninon and her lover Gino.  They are shown navigating a landscape of love and loneliness, confronting the tragic nearness of death, learning to trust and retain hope, and experiencing the great festive release of the titular celebration.  The story is told with so much love and respect for the characters that it is impossible not to be greatly affected in reading.  There is this side to Berger's work, where he compels his readers to turn away from his books and back towards the world with a new capacity for compassionate engagement.  We are invited to see the beauty and suffering that is all around us.  Berger's storytelling is a timeless art that nonetheless bears the imprint of a modern world that consistently brings new challenges to our attempt to live consciously and happily.
