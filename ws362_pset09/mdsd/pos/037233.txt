This book is the 4th in the chronicles series.  For those wanting to read the Weis/Hickman in chron. order it would be the first chronicle trilogy, legends trilogy, the second generation book, this book, which then leads into the War of Souls.  I enjoyed the story and the Weis/Hickman writing always makes me want to read into the night.  The books does have its flaws, and doesn't rate as high as the original chronicles and legends, but it is a good read and a worthy addition to the Dragonlance saga
