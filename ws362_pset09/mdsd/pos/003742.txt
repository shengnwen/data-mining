As a self-proclaimed student of how the media impacts decision-making, particularly in political and military matters, I found this book worthwhile and interesting.  Although the perspective it offers isn't particularly new, the historical examples offer many insights into the crises America has faced over the past decades and the important role the media has played in them.  There are many examples in this book that I haven't seen addressed anywhere else.  It really expanded my interest a variety of historical events from our recent past that illuminate how media has impacted political decisions and, at times, been manipulated to assert foreign policy.  This is a book you might find a bit dry at the beginning, but by the third chapter, I was thoroughly enjoying it.  Great book for anybody who's interested in government and needs a better understanding of its complex relationship with the media
