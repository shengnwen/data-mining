Keeping in mind the audience for this book, which is mainline churches, the authors do an excellent job of challenging us to rethink how we do church. Society is not what it once was, so should the church remain the same in order to communicate effectively the Gospel story? Though one reviewer did not find the book useful, he was already of the postmodern generation and not necessarily the key audience. My seminary president led a class with this book as one of our main resources. We all found it both thought provoking and well worth reading.
