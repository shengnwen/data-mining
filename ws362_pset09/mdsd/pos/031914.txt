When I bought this book I had no idea what classical mythology was. I was writing a novel about Hercules though, and needed some mythological help, so I bought the book. Luckily for me, Classical mythology is the myths of ancient Greece and Rome. 

This book has perfect, easy to read break-downs of even the most complicated myths. Often funny and always a pleasure to study, I found myself reading this at bedtime instead of a novel. It's almost a perfect work on the Greek Myths.

I had two problems with this book. One, I had no idea of the time line of the myths. Like, Hercules married Creon's daughter, but Creon's sister was married to Oedipus-so did Hercules grow up in a Thebes ruled by Oedipus or was that later on? I had no idea at all. Also a more complete family tree for the gods, sprites, titans and nymphs would have been good, but probably would have had to come in a form like a fold out map.

In short, fabulous book to get started on Greek and Roman myths, though more detailed study may be needed later on for clarification.
