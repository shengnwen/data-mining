Many books have had the word "classic" hung upon them for many reasons.  Few though deliver the goods on as many levels as does this novel.  This book is funny, alarming, exciting, sad, and thought-provoking.  The three buddies are sort of seventeenth-century drunken brats with swords whose hearts are nevertheless in the right place and win through at the end to save an empire. There are places in the book that are simply funny, something that Hollywood has keyed on.  There is a ridiculous aspect to the whole thing that is veiled only thinly in the book.  The book has some really sad twists and the ending will make anyone think.  At the end, though, most readers will agree that this book stands by itself and richly deserves the appellation "classic."  The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the outdated language.
