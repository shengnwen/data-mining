The Nancy Drew books are okay if you like a good mystery. But it's very unrealistic. How Nancy Drew always wins in the end, and how she's always lucky - even when it gets really close. All the charectors are also interesting. They're either really, really nice, or else very mean. And in real life it's not like that!
But, hey, don't get me wrong. This is a good book if you like mysteries. Just keep in mind that this is in a different world that's completely "perfect". Also, another good mystery book series is The Boxcar Children - and (surprise, surprise) they're perfect, too! Have fun reading
