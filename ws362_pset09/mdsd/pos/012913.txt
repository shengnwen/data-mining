I'm sure many will draw comparisons between this book and Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, which I liked less.  Vreeland cleverly tells her story from present to past and makes the captivating girl in the painting the central character in her tale.  I also loved her evocative descriptions of the Dutch landscape
