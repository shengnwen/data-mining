As soon as I found out I was pregnant with a boy, I checked this book out of our local library.  I found it so easy to read and such a great resource that I had to buy a copy for my own.  It offers clear insight to the various stages of a boy's life into manhood.  The metaphors for the various types of discipline can get to be a little much but the point is well made.  Although I grew up with a younger brother, this book has already given me so much more sensitivity to the needs of a young boy that I look forward to raising my 11-week old son into manhood.  I've quoted it incessantly to friends and can't help but shake my head at the parents of unruly teenage boys on talk shows, thinking they should have read the book again and again while their sons were growing up.  An invaluable resource for any woman faced with the daunting task of raising a child to be a man, especially if she has never been able to understand men
