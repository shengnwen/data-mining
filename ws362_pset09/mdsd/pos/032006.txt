I just finished reading Jimmy Moore's "Livin' La Vida Low-Carb" book and must say it's an incredible and inspirational story of his journey where he lost over 180 pounds, following the Atkins lifestyle, in one year. He shares, in a candid way, his "ups and downs" during this weight loss journey, and also give us tips on ways he overcame difficulties that came up along the way.  He writes in a manner where you feel like he's sitting in your living room telling you this story in person, including his wonderful sense of humor.

A very quick read, I highly recommend his book if you're struggling to lose weight and wonder what low carb is all about.  Keep in mind that it's not a "how to" guide ... for that you'll need to get the Atkins New Diet Revolution book.

Thanks for all of your inspiration and words of wisdom, Jimmy!  You have inspired me to return to my low-carb lifestyle, where I know, with persistence, I'll finally shed all of my extra weight
