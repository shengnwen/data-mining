I really enjoyed reading about Seth and his life. This book added so much humor to make the situations a bit more fun, especially since Seth is still young. Reading about him as a man was far better than hearing about him when he was a boy. However, a wonderful ending to a series....


Also recommended: SEASWEPT/RISING TIDES/INNER HARBOR/VILLA/BIRTHRIGHT---- WERE ALL A GOOD READ
