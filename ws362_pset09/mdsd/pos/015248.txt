This book is an exceptionally written work covering the life of Private Eddie Slovik.  It covers his disadvantaged childhood leading to brushes with the law, mostly of the petty theft variety.  The picture that develops is of a fundamentally weak man who would get by just fine if he had a crutch to lean on.  He was lucky enough to have a strong wife who guided him and provided the emotional support he needed.  Slovik appears to have been a bit stupider than most, but a decent guy.  He, along with many others, did not have the spine to be fired at by enemy soldiers, although by all accounts, he was very poised at his own execution.  His case seems to have been arbitrarily picked for execution.  Multitudes of GI's were sentenced to death for desertion, Slovik's admitted crime, but only Private Eddie Slovik was actually killed.  Another reviewer has referred to the "whining" which makes up part of the letters to his wife.  The terror and uncertainty prevalent in wartime is certain to affect even stronger characters.  The effect of war on Eddie Slovik was such that he could not bear it.  Although I believe that no human is fit to be a soldier, we are made for far better things, the drafting of a man like Eddie Slovik shows that arbitrariness of the draft of WWII that lead to the militarization of thousands of men who would not be stable under combat circumstances.  Huie writes this in a style that makes you forget there is an author.  About as objective as one could really hope to be, the facts of the case are still so moving as to bring sobs.  A compelling, tragic read
