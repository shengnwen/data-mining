This novel is not as chilling as its reputation suggests, but it is a pretty thought-provoking look into the nature of genius. Here, the standard evil government/corporate conspirators have created a drug that increases intelligence and is testing it on prisoners. However, the drug has been developed from a virus that causes venereal disease, and thus behaves in that fashion. So genius has become contagious and then leads to an awful death. In a rather refreshing way, Disch avoids dwelling too much on the doomsday scenario inherent in the story, and instead ruminates on the fine line between genius and madness, or between knowledge and death. This is especially true for the narrator Sacchetti, a writer who has been subjected to the drug testing and soon finds that genius isn't all it's cracked up to be. These are useful deep thoughts for the reader, except for some of Disch's methods of putting them across - especially through horrifically long-winded speeches by the characters, which are way beyond the scope of believable dialogue. This in turn makes some of the characters implausible in themselves, especially an unethical bureaucrat named Skilliman. There is also a little nastiness in Disch's writing style, especially toward the book's token female and black characters. However, there is a marvelous twist at the end of the story that saves human genius from such a cruel death, if not necessarily madness. [~doomsdayer520~
