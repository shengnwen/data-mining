Greene's easy-to-comprehend summary of physics up to now (2005) is a great read for everyone who is interested in what goes on behind the scenes of our everyday world. It's also a must-read for people who liked to be in awe of the knowledge that modern physicists are uncovering and how much more there is to know. If you thought you had a pretty good understanding of how the world and universe works (outside of physics), this book will boggle your mind.

Greene's style is to bring some very far-out theories in physics down to Earth with analogies to X-Files situations and Bart Simpson adventures. These can be entertaining and very helpful to the scientifically untrained mind. Still there are parts that require the reader to concentrate and try to follow some very intense concepts.

I liken this to a modern-day 'Cosmos,' which was astronomer Carl Sagan's monumental book and television series. It's important for everyone to read books like these if not for the direct impact quantum physics and string theory has on us, but for the imagination and inspiration it can stir in the reader. We are learning so much, especially the fact that we have everything to learn
