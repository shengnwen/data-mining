Lana Wood's tribute to her sister Natalie is a poignant, heart-wrenching and engrossing book that sums up the love/hate, resentment and longing often applied to siblings, but in this case, the older sister was a Hollywood superstar and the little sister was a wallflower continually in her shadow.  Their mother, Maria, was an overbearing, fanciful and sometimes downright cold parent who wanted fame and fortune for herself and pushed Natalie into show business, forever relegating her husband and other two daughters into the background, to the point where she considered them virtual non-entities.  Lana recounts the years of her family's life in Tinsletown, penning both her love and admiration for her famous sibling as well as her resentment and frustration.  Although they had their disputes in later years, their sisterly bond brought them back together, fortunately, before Natalie's tragic death.  It amazes me that Lana is still increasingly loyal to her mother, who ignored her and compared her to Natalie, and who inflicted such pain on her children.  It can't be easy to have your mother neglect you, your father so distant and an alcoholic, and have to try to measure up to a sister who is a major Hollywood talent.  As much as they feuded, Lana clearly loved her sister dearly, a loss that she undoubtly feels to this day.  Her estrangment from Natalie's husband Robert Wagner (who seems to delight in slamming her), and her nieces continues to the present, no doubt causing her a great deal of anguish.

"I cry for her often.  I expect I always will.
