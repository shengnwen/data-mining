I must say that I was amazed when I saw that a novel such as To the Lighthouse has averaged only four out of five stars. That a classic of excellent literature that has proven the test of time would score only four stars, when many poorly written contemporary novels receive five stars is truly an irony of our age. As I looked over the reviews, I noted that there were some that gave the novel only one star! Usually these were the individuals that had a difficult time comprehending the book and could not make a distinction between that lack of comprehension and a piece of world class literature. Although one reviewer did acknowledge that she knew this was a piece of fine twentieth century work, she still went on to give it one star. I think that this type of review is necessary in order to let other readers know that it will be a difficult reading; however, I also think that it misleads in implying that the book is worth very little, and this might discourage others from making the effort and perhaps getting much more out of the novel than its one-star reviewers.

To the Lighthouse is worth the difficulty it takes to read and comprehend. It would be my recommendation to serious readers to go to outside sources - either through Amazon,online resources, or at the library - that would help in understanding the book. In this way a profound novel would get its due and readers would have the benefit of an enriching experience.
