This book is about the Vietnam war. But it is not just about Vietnam.

This is a book about the US political system and how it can be highjacked by a President wanting to do so. It shows how McCarthy made Washington scared of truth. And so started the delusions about China and then Vietnam. And the President could take the nation to war without sharing it with the Congress, Senate, and the people. This book is about how fragile the US presidential form of Government is, and how few checks and balance actually work.

This is also a book about careerists, blinded by success in the 'system', devoid of moral compasses. There are many in that era who had doubts. But they refused to sacrifice their careers for the sake of their doubts. This book shows how dangerous rationalists like McNamara and Bundy, the 'best and brightest' can be, if devoid of an anchor of values and ethics. 

This is also a book about how narrow the US Government perspective was. Narrow in space where Vietnam was 'no match' to the superiority of American soldiers and technology. Narrow also in time where lessons from history were brushed aside. 

This is also a book about lack of humility. It is full of 'can-do' characters full of optimism. And anyone who wants to think of contingencies is considered soft at best, at worst a traitor. Halberstam shows how lack of humility leads to final humiliation.

And finally, this book is about today, about another country in Asia. While reading this I almost felt that I was reading about the Iraq war. Doubtful basis for entry. Faith in limited, short term war, and then a tiger that is easy to mount but tough to get off. If we do not learn from History, we are doomed to repeat it. And we are doing it
