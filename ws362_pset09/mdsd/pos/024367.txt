Like all of the Jodi Picoult novels I've read to date, this one slides down as easily as ice cream. She is a masterful storyteller, with the ability to pull you into a time and place, and an extraordinary family situation. Plain Truth tells the story of an Amish girl by the name of Katie Fisher and the lawyer, Ellie Hathaway, who defends her in a murder trial. Katie is accused of neonaticide, killing a baby she refuses to admit she delivered even though it is a medically indisputable fact that she has just given birth.

The plot unfolds around the psychological treatment of Katie and Ellie's immersion into the Fisher family and the Amish (or Plain) way of life. It held my interest from the start, until what at first appears to be a tidy (and disappointing) ending. But to my delight, it offers an unexpected twist. I read the last page with complete satisfaction.

Certainly a must for Picoult fans, but for readers unfamiliar with her work, if you like well-written stories, with emphasis on both character AND plot, this one's for you. Additionally, if you have any interest in the Amish culture, this book is interesting and enlightening. Picoult has certainly done her research.
