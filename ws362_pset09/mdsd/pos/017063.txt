Newspapers and magazines take glee in deriding academics.  It has become a spectator sport.  But calling an academic pedantic hardly seems sporting -- or particularly original.

Reading this book reminded me of why i went to college -- to explore ideas in ways that I hadn't before.  It's true that the authors in this volume take rather similar positions; however, it's also true that it's a much-needed explanation of why new ideas sometimes sound new.  

It also shows how writing needs to be read in context -- not only do individual sentences often need the paragraphs around them to make sense, but individual publications often need the context of other writings to make sense.  Each writer shouldn't need to review or rewrite all of philosophical history at the beginning of every article or book!  Authors should, in certain times and places, be able to start from the assumption that their writings speak to a particular tradition, one that not every reader is immediately familiar with.  

So asking if individual sentences can be rephrased to be clearer is sometimes beside the point.  Asking if Judith Butler's writings make a contribution to a philosophical tradition dating back to the pre-Socratics is the real question.  After all, Plato and Aristotle wrote some texts that were meant to instruct a wider studentship and others that seemed too difficult to the novice scholar.  They needed both kinds of writing.  So do we.
