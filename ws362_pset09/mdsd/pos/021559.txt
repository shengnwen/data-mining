As a friend of the author's I had an early chance to read and look at the support materials associated with, &quot;I got Here. You can too!&quot;.  I have been down the many paths of wins and losses this book talks about.  I am on the plus side and I know what it takes to be there.  Purchasing any business guidance book thinking, &quot;reading this will make me a millionaire&quot;, is the wrong approach.  Wealth and/or financial freedom come with knowledge, work and a faith in the chosen plan and goal.  &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; can be panned and will be a waste of your time if no continued effort to follow the guidelines is put forth.  Read this book, follow the guidelines to make your plan, do the work and then judge its value
