Sue Grafton does a great job keeping this series fresh and interesting. Four books in and I still can't wait to read more! And she gets better with each book. In this book (and to a smaller degree in 'C') there were many times where I couldn't fathom how Kinsey would keep on the trail and solve the case. But she always manages to plausibley get back on the trail without causing the reader to lose interest. Kinsey's development as a character is also very well done. She is a very real, likeable person with amazing depth
