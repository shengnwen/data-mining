The Scratch of a Pen is certainly a worthwhile read.  Short, only 171 pages of text, Scratch of a Pen does a great job of laying out how the events of 1763 had far reaching consequences that no one alive at the time could have predicted.  Britain was the big winner at the end of the French and Indian War, but ended up ruining future control of the continent by over taxing the inhabitants.  In the end the native Americans that fought with Britain ended up doing no better than did those who opposed the English.
The whole period serves as an example of "unintended consequences"...how even the smallest outcome can snowball in the future.

Calloway does a masterful job at relating the events of 1763 and much more.  Researched by someone who loves to do research but is also a good writer, Calloway manages to convey the full impact of 1763.

I can't criticize because of the brevity of the work.  It does what its supposed to do.
