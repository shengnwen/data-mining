I liked "A Tour of the Calculus" a lot.  This book was not as good and it was fairly difficult to get through, but there are some gems in it; things I would like to remember so that I can comfort myself with when I'm troubled because I don't understand how exactly a computer works.  I remember in particular his attempt to describe what logic is.  As human beings, our understanding of things is unavoidably subjective, and I appreciate Berlinski because he provides subjective explanations, whereas you will probably never find such in textbooks or most other books
