Katherine Mansfield is one of those writers you come across that make you notice their writing.  In &quot;The Garden Party&quot; she not only turns your attention to her style, but maintains it.  Her writing is near perfect in form.  While I find other writers who wrote during her time to be obstruse, she strikes me as clear and honest.  She is not forceful, she is not powerful, but somethings in life require finesse.  Mansfield takes finesse to the next level and turns it from an art into a science--though she would probably prefer her work described as an excercise in art.  She is worth the read.  Pity she didn't have enought time on this world to grace us with more of what I call real literature
