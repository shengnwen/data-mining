I got the chance to meet Erik Weihenmeyer last spring when he visited the gym where I climb and gave a talk.  While he is a tiny bit on the arrogant side (honestly though who wouldn't be if they were blind and climbed the 7 summits)he also has a unique approach to being blind.  A friend of mine was directing him up a route and said "reach for the big yellow hold", Erik responded "yellow huh?"  I was a bit dissapointed with the book (I've only read the edition that does not include the Everest summit) I felt like it dwelled too much on being blind and other people's inability to get past the fact that he was blind.  It did seem a bit like the book was written because that's what everyone does gets all famous and writes their life story.  I would have liked the book better if it had focussed on the fantastic climbing that he has done and less on the fact that he couldn't see it.  I think it is interesting that one of his climbing partners said upon summiting Everest "look at the view" that says to me that Erik Weihenmeyer is just another climber, I think he needs to realize that
