The stories were languid yet wry.  Very enjoyable.  However, I don't believe I've ever encountered such careless errors.  In addition to numerous spelling errors, the chapter heading was wrong in TWO cases!  The introduction was lacking as well.  Read George MacDonald, but get a different edition of his works
