There are lots of books out there about converting to judaism, however many of them cover the history, basic rituals and traditions and whatnot, but very few detail the more indepth things such as what the conversion ceremony will entail, the idea and how-to's of the mikvah etc.  This book was great in that respect.  I highly recommend any book by Anita Diamant her writing style is easy and motivates you to want to keep reading
