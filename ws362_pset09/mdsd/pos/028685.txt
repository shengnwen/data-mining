Sybil's tale, not to imply that what she experienced was not real, is told simply by Flora Rheta Schreiber.  Through exhaustive research of Sybil's case using psychiatrists notes, extended interview with both Sybil and her therapist, and background interviews with people who remember Sybil as a child, Schreiber creates a masterful description of the intense suffering of Sybil.  It is worthy to note that through her work on this book, Schreiber and Sybil became life-long friends.  Sybil is a testament to anyone suffering from severe, long-term mental illness that healing and a pretty doggone normal life are possible
