The laundry in this expedition gets aired in this book.  This seems to be the book that the movie K2 was based on. A lot of the characters and events are similar. Rowell gives a lot of historical background from other  expeditions to K2. Rowell writes this novel from his perspective, but he  also uses the diaries from the other expedition members to tell the story.  He also gives the perspective from the porters point of view, however, it  seems like he is mostly guessing what the porters feel and think and I've  never like that from a ethnographic point of view. Considering the trouble  the expedition had, it's a wonder that any of them wanted to return.  Some  of the best photographs of the region are shown.  Galen is great  photographer
