I'm not an astrological fanatic, however it's really intriguing to me how  accuarte this book was.  My brother was the initial owner of the previous  addition which was wonderful- My family was so intrigues that after eleven  signs testes with people in our family-  at the end, we all agreed that all  were virtually accurate.        Recently, I went to the bookstore to buy  the new edition- which was essentially the same. Naturally, I thought that  maybe the yearly advice for each animal would be different since the change  in years- this was not true however.  The book, if you do not own it - is  probably the most accurate thing out there, however- it does not pay to get  both editions.  -enjoy
