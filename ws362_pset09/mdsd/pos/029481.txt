Funny, but people seem to believe all show business folks know each other (they don't). Same for sales trainers (we don't either!). So Stephan Schiffman and I, both successful sales trainers/authors/speakers/consultants, somehow managed to avoid each other out on the road for almost 40 years - before finally doing a sales training seminar together just a few months ago. As for me, I was impressed! He had the audience in stiches, while teaching them some very solid sales information.

Understand, "The 25 Sales Habits of Highly Successful Salespeople" is not one of Steve's deeper works (he has plenty of those!). But it a wonderful tool for new salespeople who must first learn the basics of selling, and for any established salesperson who needs to get "re-threaded" (as we all do from time-to-time).

And don't get distracted by some of the negative reviews I saw about Steve's book. Those people are, in my humble opinion, missing the point. Even my material ("The Closers" series of books/audios/videos/newsletters/seminars) gets rapped on occasion. But as does Steve, I find solace in knowing how many salespeople have gotten rich using my material!

Note: You may have noticed that all of my book reviews carry "5 Star" ratings (*****). But that's not the sign of a "soft reviewer." I only review books to which I can honestly give a "5 Star" rating. You may assume, therefore, that any sales training/self-improvement book without my "5 Star" rating is either something less than "5 Star," or I simply haven't gotten to it yet . . . and there are certainly plenty of those!
