A real sleeper - I'm surprised after reading it that the book isn't more well known. Very well written and compelling. The author juxtaposes the war and it's history with the daily life of the people living it. She's a keen observer of both history and human nature. She does, I think, leave out some history that seems important now but maybe they weren't to her at the time. Highly recomended.
