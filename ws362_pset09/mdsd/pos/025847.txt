This book is a wonderful contribution to the world.  It has become required reading for many of my female friends and their husbands/boyfriends.  It has helped spark internal and external discussions that many of us know we need to have, but haven't known where to begin.  As I reached the end of the book, I found myself wanting more -- I'd love to read the full transcripts of some of the interviews with the women I identified most with.  I've become an evangelist for this book, and I'm recommending that all of the women I know (including my mom, sister-in-law, friends) read it as soon as possible
