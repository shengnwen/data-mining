This book seems to have been completely rewritten by the new author, only keeping the outline of the original, and it's for the better. The writing is as careful as the original, and as economical, so you have to master the early chapters or the rest is hopeless, as things start off slowly but quickly become difficult. It begins by considering the error in a single measurement, and proceeds to estimating errors derived from curve fitting. A few nuclear decay experiments provide examples throughout, and the author insists on calculating many quantities manually, even though in practice it would never be done that way. Some background topics like matrix algebra appear in the appendix too
