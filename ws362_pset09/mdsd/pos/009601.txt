I was looking for a detailed account of the sacrifices and bravery of individual soldiers fighting in the front lines during the six day war. What I got instead was a full account of the overall events, starting with 169 tedious pages of the step by step of the political communications and misunderstandings between the parties that were involved directly or indirectly on the events leading to the war, followed by a chronological description of the overall battle, and closing with and again political process that brought the war to the end.

Not what I was looking for, but I do not regret reading the book, because the author does a great job of putting the whole chain of events of the six days war in a comprehensible manner
