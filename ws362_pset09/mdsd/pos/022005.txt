This historical novel is the third and final part of a trilogy that began with Gettysburg, and as the title suggests, this volume chronicles the final stages of the Civil War.  The trilogy begins during the Battle of Gettysburg, and describes how the course of the war might have changed had General Lee taken General Longstreet's advice at the end of the second day of battle.  What follows is a riveting account of the rest of the "alternate Civil War".  The authors describe strategy, tactics, and battle scenes with great realism, and all the developments were easier to follow than the "real thing".  Character development was very thorough and added a great deal to the over all understanding of the events (I hope not too much "fictional license" was taken).

Overall, this book was an excellent read, as was the entire trilogy.  I think they would be worthwhile to the most casual student of the Civil War
