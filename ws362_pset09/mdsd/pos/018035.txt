Robert Graves is known for his eccentricities and eclectic readings of the classic Greek myths.  But this is the definitive edition because it gives the literary sources, from Homer to Pausanias and many others.  I also own the Folio Society's slipcased, handsomely illustrated edition of the same work.  For reasons that I cannot even guess at, its editors decided to omit the sources, an omission that I believe destroys its value.  The only problem with the paperback edition is that it wears out sooner rather than later, but the price is such that replacing it is affordable
