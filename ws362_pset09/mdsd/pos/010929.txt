I read this book many years ago and if I had a copy I would reread a lot of it.  It is entertaining to read about the less discussed details of the lives of some of these monoliths of intellectual endeavours.  If you disagree with my enthusiasm just realize I spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars in college to be introduced to these guys discussed in this book.  I was relieved to findout that they were not perfect.  Read about Hemmingway's drinking problem, and I particularly like the discussion about how some intellectuals like Chomsky can move from one field to another (linguistics to politics) and carry authority with them.  As a fan of Chomsky this critique was an epiphany! Look inside the book and if you find a thinker or writer you want to learn more about get the book
