I found this book really useful and could not stop wondering how could so much common sense escape my understanding before? Ms Ryan's advice is pretty obvious, however, here we are doing it wrong once and again. I can't say this book is responsible for me getting or not getting interviews so far, but at least I now feel confident enough to think I'm sending a decent cover letter. If you think that this book is going to make the process of cover letter writing faster and easier, you'll get disappointed since it is rather the opposite. But what has to be done has to be done and at least now you know. I didn't give it 5 stars because it gets too repetitive, full of examples that are great, but as usual, there may be one in twenty (if any) that even resembles one's own situation.
