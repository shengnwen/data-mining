After doing my own research, I ended up purchasing this book. I agree completely with the other reviews - its the best book, its the only book you need, and I congratulate the author on making this a flexible yet thorough resource that guides you pictorally through every step of the process. Just plain awesome, and I just finished my deck and I love it - it exceeds my expectations and its due to the advice in these pages
