This book is probably the most enlightening book that I have encountered with regards to 9/11. He gives the events of what happened that day in the White House and what he did during that time. It was amazing to see that Presidents have their own agenda and in some cases, like this one, it really doesn't matter what others have to say. (Of course, most people realize that already.) He also gives information regarding what the U.S. did do as well as what they should have done to possibly prevent the events of 9/11 from ever happening. I believe that every American must read this book, whether you are republican, democrat or independent or just don't care about politics. This book puts things in a perspective that many Americans don't think of!
