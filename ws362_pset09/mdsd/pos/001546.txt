I am so glad Raven wrote this book and addresses the errors in Mr.Hutton's book (Triumph of the Moon),maybe Ms. Curott(WitchCraft) should read this book too! Raven gives facts &amp; references about the history of Witchcraft and proves from his historical references that the Craft &amp; Witches has been around for centuries and not just something Garner &amp; Valiente made up.Every Witch that does not have access to a High Priestess or Coven should read this book to learn why they are doing what &amp; why the tools of the Craft are so important, and the tenets etc.In the past,probably starting with S.Cunningham,the books on Wicca have said to do &quot;this or that&quot; or &quot;use this and that&quot; but if &quot;this or that&quot; does not feel right or you don't want to &quot;use this or that&quot; to discard it! In this book you'll read that tenets ,ways of thinking and basic elements of the Craft  are there &amp; used for a reason &amp; to dicard them is throwing out well-worn paths our ancestors of the Craft have used for centuries.They are there for a reason!! This book gives the mentality a Witch should have,inner mechanism etc. I haven't finished the book yet but I know I'll go back &amp; re-read it as soon as I am done.It has that much information in it!! Every Witch should have this book in their library along with &quot;Wiccan Mysteries&quot; and you'll  have all the books that you will ever need
