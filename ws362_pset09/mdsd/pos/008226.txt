James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man takes the reader on an historic and intellectual journey. Through the eyes of young Stephen Daedelus do the readers see Joyce's life and the challenges that he encountered. The intentional naming of his characters enables Joyce to relate more closely to his story and be more expressive in his writing. Ireland at the time was in another battle of Catholicism versus Protestantism. This is exemplified at the dinner table scene, where young Daedelus tells of his family discussions and his budding interest in religion. Initially he was a `free thinker,' not willing to be part of the `group.' However, as he grew older and wiser, he saw the good in religion-the moral compass it provides followers with.
	Stephen's journey is one of a young boy trying to cope with his binary society. In Ireland of the late 19th century, one was Catholic or Protestant, family man or individualistic, or `in' the group or not. As Stephen ages, he learns to cope with these trends in his life; he grasps religion to the extent of almost being zealous. The unique part about Portrait is that it enables the reader to peer into the life of James Joyce, an acclaimed literary mastermind. Like Stephen, Joyce was a Catholic trying to cope with his society, eventually pursuing the arts (in the form of writing). This unique style of writing makes Portrait not only classic literature, but a masterpiece capturing the life of a genius
