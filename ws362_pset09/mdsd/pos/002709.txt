I am not really a romance/mystery reader, but I was bored and thought I'd give it a whirl.  I usually like the drama-filled stories.  I can now say that I have been inducted into the reading world of romance/mystery with thanks to Sandra Brown.  This was the most exciting, well-written suspense novel I have ever read.  I thought I had it figured out well before the middle of the book.  But as I neared the end, all of my instincts were snuffed out, considering how I'm a pretty good judge of character.  If you're looking for a good suspense, this will satisfy your search
