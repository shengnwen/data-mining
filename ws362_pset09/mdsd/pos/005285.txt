A good guide to understand who is meat in Wall St. No one could explain me up to the moment I read this book why guys like Mr Byron Wien, Ms Meeker, Mr Grubman, Mr Blodget, Mr Quattrone et al climbed the corporate ladder while others succeeded running out of that grinding process. Now, can someone explain me why guys like Mr Byron Wien are still invited as key speakers to so called "important, can't miss" hedge funds events??
