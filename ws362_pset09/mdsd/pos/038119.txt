Jen Lancaster is living the good life in Chicago with Prada purses, great job and live in boyfriend Fletch.  Then September 11, 2001 comes around and within a month Jen loses her job and the good life that she has always enjoyed.  Now she finds herself sending out hundreds of resumes, watching "The Price is Right" and going to the umemployment office with her Prada bag. When things can't get any worse they, her now husband Fletch loses his job and these two now find themshelves in some serious trouble.
I loved "Bitter is the New Black" Jen gives a voice to so many people who can't speak for themshelves.  She shows in clear detail whats like to make hard choices each day. Such what bill to pay and can we afford food this week.  I was so pleased that Jen was able to learn what happen to her and as someone who is working there way out debt I completely understood where she was coming from. Can't wait for her next boo
