This book is comprehensive and easy to use.  I had no idea how many options there could be for a ceremony or how to put one together.  Metrick, has provided a step by step guide with wonderful examples.  I've seen reviews of her work as an officiant on the Knot, and apparently she's draws from many traditions with ease and is great to work with.  I loved the excerpts of ceremonies that she includes in the book.  What a good way to see possibilities
