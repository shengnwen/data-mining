There must be a thousand and one ways to read "Invisible Man" by Ralph Ellison but in my preferred and personal reading it is the secret drama of the true America; not the America worshipped in high politics, big business, and celebrated in the major media.  Below the shimmering shards of official American optimism and narcissistic posturing is the unnamed protagonist suffering what is given him to suffer, knowing the unbearable secrets of what he must know, doing the terrible deeds that are given him to do.
Ellison has taken the central story of the black descendants of slaves and shown that it is a universal story - the tale of whoever you are out there living on the fringes of prestige and power in the True America - despised, rejected, and outcast. 
It is its centricity to the occult human spirit whereever it suffers that makes "Invisible Man" one of the top three or four great novels of the American century that is now past
