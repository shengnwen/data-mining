Although I'm not an expert in Arab history per se, I am something of a student of Islamic religious sciences- which is incidentally a huge chunk of the Arab intellectual tradition (along with philosophy). Hourani masterfully covers the three basic disciplines- sharia (law, jurisprudence), kalam (theology), and Sufism (mysticism, spirituality)- and traces their development historically, frequently quoting primary sources. It is certainly one of the best, most comprehensive treatments I have come across. In regards to some reviewers faulting Hourani for not devoting enough space to Prophet Muhammad- I believe Hourani made a wise choice; he basically limited his treatment to what everyone can agree on, which I think is appropriate since this is a book on Arab and not Islamic history. However, it is indeed sometimes difficult to separate Arab from Islamic history; Imam al Ghazali, a key figure in this book and a towering figure in Islamic scholasticism, was actually a Persian, while Saladin, the most famous Muslim leader during the Crusades, was of Kurdish background. Indeed, one could even argue that the Arabs had a relatively limited political/economic role in Islamic history after 900 AD. compared to the Persians and Turks.
