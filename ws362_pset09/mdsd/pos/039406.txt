I went into a bookstore in search of a different book but purchased this one instead after browsing through the chapter I identified as my 2 year old daughter, a highly sensitive child.  I agreed with everything the author described in regard to this character, and I even found myself in the book.  As a teacher and parent, I believe this is the best book I have seen in recognizing and nurturing the five different "challenging" children.  Even my husband, who is always a bit skeptical with parenting books, was amazed at how on-target this one is.  I highly recommend this book for anyone not only wishing to identify with a "challenging" child but also desiring to assist that child as he/she deals with the daily struggles that face that particular temperment
