I loved Dale Hope's new book, The Aloha Shirt: Spirit of the Islands, so much that I bought three copies! Everything about the book: research, text, layout, photography and binding is absolutely first class. This book documents the evolution of the aloha shirt--and the evolution of Hawaii as a tourism mecca--through oral history and pictoral artifacts, carefully assembled by the author during his 10-year quest.  If you've ever been to Hawaii (or dreamed of it), ever worn or admired an aloha shirt, or can appreciate a true work of art --BUY THIS BOOK
