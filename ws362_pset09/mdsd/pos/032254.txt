This is the textbook for a course offered in CS at the University of Chicago.  As a chemist, I found the introduction and Chapter 3 to be a an excellent introduction to the ideas from classical computation theory needed to understand quantum computation.  I also found Chapter 2 to be one of the better introductions to quantum mechanics I have seen.  Qubits are an excellent basis (unintended joke) for learning quantum mechanics on.  I've checked out a few books on the subject and have found no finer book for anyone-chemist, physicist, mathematician, computer scientist-to learn quantum computing
