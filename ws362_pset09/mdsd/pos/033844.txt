Hari Kunzru's debut is reminiscent of John Irving's "Son of the Circus" with its "East meets West" main character and his many comic escapades.  There's a little "Poisonwood Bible" thrown in as the same character, in one his guises, ends up with a demented missionary in "darkest Africa."  The writing shifts from the ridiculous to the sublime--overall an entertaining read bringing promise of more to come from a talented young (30-year old) author
