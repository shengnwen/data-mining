Unlike most art books, this small volume has been in print continuously since 1978 &amp; when you read it, it isn't hard to see why: superb reproductions and an extremely elegant design (plus its small size - very  unusual in art publishing) offer the reader a wonderful experience  wandering in Monet's vision of a carefully constructed alternate reality.   In Monet's Giverny, natural forms respond instantly to light.  The images  produce a peculiar sense of floating in the viewer - many of the pictures  lack a horizon line or any indication of where the viewer is in relation to  the picture.  As a result, we seem to hover in flight, poised above a  constantly shifting panorama of woods, water, fields, and lilies.   Interestingly, no human figures are visible in these works (Monet was never  really a figure painter) producing a peculiar sensation of isolation and  contemplation in the spectator - we wander through this magical land alone,  or with whatever companion we desire.  A superlative achievement which has  found few imitators in the world of art publishing
