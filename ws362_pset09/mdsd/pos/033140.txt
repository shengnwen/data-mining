I was struggling with my short game.  Pitch over the green, followed by another pitch over the green and maybe even a third for good measure.  I was so frustrated I decided I had to do something. I sat down and started reading this book.  The next day I golfed and my pitching improved dramatically.  Simple instruction on stance, swing and grip helped tremendously.  It is the first and only thing I have found to be a quick fix in over ten years of playing this maddening sport.  If your pitching game is already good maybe you don't need this but if your drives you crazy like mine did, get this and read it
