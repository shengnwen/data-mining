This book is a must have for managers in theater. It covers most of the typical contractual issues managers face. This book's biggest asset is the CD. The CD allows you to download and modify virtually all the documents included in the book.
You need to have a bit more than a cursory understanding of the legal principles behind some of the language in the agreements, but if you have that knowledge you will refer to this book time and again
