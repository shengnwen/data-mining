This book is second to none in the area of personal development/life success.  I have read the &quot;classics&quot; in this area from authors such as  Napolean Hill, Dale Carnegie, Og Mandino, Earl Nightingale, and  Norman Vincent Peale to the leaders of today such as Anthony Robbins,  Stephen Covey, Zig Ziglar, and Brian Tracy.  They are all great but Wallace  D. Wattles has them all beat with this masterpiece.  This is not just a way  of thought but in actual blueprint for wealth. There are certain laws to  acquiring riches and once obeyed and followed getting rich is reduced to an  exact science. Do exactly what this book tells you to do and you will get  rich with mathematical certainty. Once the word gets out on this book it  will go down in history as one of the &quot;classics.&quot; I read one  chapter every night of my life and I'm now on my 20th reading of this book.  Don't even think twice about not getting this book. Read it, learn it,  memorize it, live it, and apply it. Best of luck and may an abundant life  be yours.                                      &quot;Dr. Harry&quot
