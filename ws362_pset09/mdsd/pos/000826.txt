This is one of my favorite novels by Dumas.  Spellbinding to the end, it follows young Margot and her power-hungry family from the St. Bartholemew's Day Massacre to King Louis' death.  Dumas is at his finest, rivaling The Count of Monte Cristo with his provoking prose and poetic descriptions.   The characters and plot, based loosely on real figures and events in French  history, evoke a variety of emotions in the reader and the final chapters  leave one breathless.  If you plan on reading any book by Dumas (besides  the Count), read THIS one
