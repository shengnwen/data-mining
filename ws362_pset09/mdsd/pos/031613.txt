I love the work of Ethan Mordden, and have read, years go, BUDDIES, EVERYONE LOVE YOU, and  I'VE A FEELING WERE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE.  They were wonderful, chummy, literate, and thought provoking.  The same can be said for SOME MEN ARE LOOKERS.  I bought this book probably in 1998 when it first came out, and it became lost among the other books I bought at the same time.  Not until just last week, (September, 2005) did I dig the book out to read.  I knew I had to read it in order to be able to read the last of the CYCLE, that I had ordered via Amazon a month ago.

Mordden had me hooked with the first book in the cycle, and the 4th installment is equally engaging.  The story looks at the somewhat complicated and established lives of  Bud, Daniel Savage, Little Kiwi, (Virgil), Cosgrove (don't ask), and Carlo.  The intimacy of their relationships, as well as the alienations that develop in the relationships, is the crux of the story.  Humor, pathos, anger, resentment, reflection, ageism, lust, passion, hurt, desolation, depression, frustration, resignation...all these human emotions and more are presented to the reader in this wonderful simple story of a rather eclectic "family".  As with his other "Buddies Books", in feasted on the story and drama, and eagerly awaited each plot twist and turn.  

Honestly, when I finished the book, I felt unfulfilled, but, I knew that the next and last of the Cycle, HOW'S YOUR ROMANCE?, would allay all of my concerns and provide me with some closure.  Read the entire series...you will be enthralled.
