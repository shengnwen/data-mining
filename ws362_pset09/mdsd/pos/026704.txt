Throughout the years the White Sox till this day have not won a World Series.  Their last appearance was in 1959 and never sniffed a postseason berth until 1993. Anyway, this book was articulately written to the tee.  Arsinoff describes the ups and downs of a franchise that was on a brink of running away with the world title against the underdog Cincinnati Reds and yet they folded and laid an egg, losing the series 5 games to 3.  On and off the field and in the courtroom, Asinoff gives stunning detail of every aspect of a sad situation that eight men gambled to throw away the world series.  Even though they were not found guilty of any crime in federal court they were all found guilty by Commisioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis and banned from the sport.  This book to me is considered as well written and fully detailed book of a team that underachieved because thier owner was a bit cheap in the pockets so they decided to take a chance that almost cost the integrity and credibility of the game itself
