The author certainly has done what he simply inspires others to do through this book and that is to 1) don't let a thing stand in your way 2) embrace your passion 3) you've got to work diligently towards your goals 4) produce something to be proud of! That, indeed, will motivate you in the direction of your next goal &quot;road&quot;. I've read many books and attended powerful seminars. By purchasing the book, I have invested in my simple reminder to never let a thing stand in my way
