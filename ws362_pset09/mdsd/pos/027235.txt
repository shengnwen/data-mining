Matthew Reilly has hit a home run his first time out of the box.  This is an adrenaline junkies dream book, I loved it!!!  Please do not read this book if you are looking for something cerebral or even believable.  That is not the intention of the author.  He has written a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, turning pages as rapidly as you can possibly consume the words.  It is exciting, entertaining and above all, fun.  So kick back, take the phone off the hook, grab a coke and some chips and LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!
