I cannot add very much that hasn't already been stated in these spaces.  The reader, however, must remain aware that this book is very self-serving to Mr. Ames.  Like John Walker, he finds excuses for his abominable actions  by blaming others: the CIA, the federal bureaucracy, our &quot;consuming  society,&quot; his wife, his mother-in-law, etc.  The book, however,  is  very well written and informative.  It is well worth reading
