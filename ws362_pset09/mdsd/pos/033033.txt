Jessica Allodola, a senior at Ramsa High School, is not your average teenager.  Under the pen name Ash Night, Jessica has already published a vampire novel entitled TIGER, TIGER.  She also has a pretty mean spirit, goes mostly ignored by her fellow students, and acts mostly indignantly towards her adopted mother.

The problem is that with the arrival of two new students in school, Caryn and Alex, her book seems to be coming to life.  Caryn claims to be a witch, descended from the Smoke line that Jessica wrote about in her book.  Alex, a spitting image for her anti-hero, Aubrey, might very well be a vampire.  And suddenly life starts to get a whole lot more confusing.

DEMON IN MY VIEW is an entertaining vampire story, but it never gains the potential it might have if the story was fleshed out a bit more.  Although Jessica's fiction begins to merge with real life, the chapters of the book are short, and the characters, though interesting, aren't as well-rounded as they could have been.  What really irritated me about the book was the ending.

--SPOILER--SPOILER--SPOILER--
Aubrey turns Jessica into a vampire to save her life, but there's no resolution after that.  Wham..she's a vampire..the end.  I would have liked to have seen how the story progressed.

Overall, DEMON IN MY VIEW is a quick, fun read, but it's definitely not the best young adult vampire story out there.
