this book never gets old.  i've had it for so long and now i'm off to college and i still enjoy reading it cover to cover.  anne is a great character, one who is easy to love and who explains herself well.  the other characters are also quirky.  something about this book is very universal, which i think explains why even in this century i still find myself being able to relate to Anne.  the plot, while essentially a love story, is not overly sappy.  and while most people would probably expect the ending, the twists and turns throughout the novel keep you entertained and engaged
