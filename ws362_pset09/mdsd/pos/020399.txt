I happen to know Ann Dugan and I reviewed her orginal book published in 1987 not 1989 as the previous reviewer wrote. The orginal book was written by Ms Dugan alone and did not include the co-authors of this book. All co-authors were given recognition throughout the book. The orginal book was  published locally and not widely distributed. Some of the material of the  original book is included in Franchising 101 but has been updated. As a  consultant in this field I have recommended this book to many potential  franchisees as it is the only guide that provides a one stop overview of  the entire process from selection to purchase to actual running of a  franchise unit.. It is easy to read in a format that makes it highly useful  for those entering the franchising proces
