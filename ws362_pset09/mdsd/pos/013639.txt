...and I love women who curse so this is a winning combination all the way around for me. I'm not sure even the author understands the power "Fear of Flying" had on males as well as females. I read it when I was 18 years old and I still consider it one of the best books I've ever read. As for this memoir of sorts...well, it is disjointed, as critics have charged, but I loved reading the interesting story of Erica's life even though it's piecemeal and in one anecdote after another. It's all connected in the author's mind but not enough for the casual reader. Still, you've got to give her major points for honesty and admitting regret. Loved it but probably only for diehard Erica fans.
