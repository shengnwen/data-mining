This is a story that creates a world of its own, a special town where the senses drive the story, where details jump off the mage and lodge in memory. The author writes about layers of loss the characters soldier through with freshness and determination, taking us on a journey of hope as the characters bond in moving forward.

The novel has no predictable strokes of description or emotional cliches-- and for that alone it is a masterpiece.
