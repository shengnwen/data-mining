Seife's prose can be rather florid, especially in the opening chapter, which is very appropriately numbered 0. He walks you through the efforts by the Old Greeks and Romans to grasp the concept of zero. Hampered by a miserable non-positional numbering system.

En route, he reminds us that the Common Era year numbering system we use skips a zero year between 1 BC and 1 CE. All due to a priest called Bede in the Dark Ages, who was ignorant of zero.

Labouriously and slowly, the idea of zero jelled in maths. But Seife also manages to corral in discussion of other ideas that gave similar problems. Like imaginary numbers, which struggled for centuries for a correct resolution. Physics is also dragged in, over the concept of an absolute zero temperature. Here, perhaps, the book's argument is more of an analogy
