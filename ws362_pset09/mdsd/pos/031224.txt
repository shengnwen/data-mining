This book is fun to read. Seemingly, it is very light reading as it is packed with lists, quotes and aphorisms.  This book spoke directly to me because it is the product of Dirda's life of learning. With more and more people retreating further into escapism they are missing the joys and challenges that are possible through self improvement and life long learning. Dirda is right- who knows what book will speak to whom- so keep reading a healthy variety of books and you will be amazed. Dirda provides endless recommendations for reading.

This was my first experience with Dirda- a Washington Post book editor. I have been very pleased so far. I took more notes in this book than the books I used in college.  Dirda's insights, gentle instruction and recommendation make this a memorable book (and one that I will always keep on my desk). This book will make a great gift for all readers and bibliophiles. It will also be good for those that have allowed their literary pursuits to diminish as the work is an effective call to the book life and all pleasures therein
