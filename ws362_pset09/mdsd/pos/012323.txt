Okay, say what you will about Bill O'Reilly, he certainly won't be at my funeral, but the message of this book is very insightful.  Keep politics in perspective and this book is valuable for the overall message it carries, like the title says, it is really an analysis of your life.  Are the important people in your life taking you into consideration?  
Review every book you read- authors deserve your opinions, not just elitist critics
