Usually available only in expensive private editions and nineteenth century complilations, the New York Review Books paperback edition of Robert Burton's "The Anatomy of Melancholy" is handy and relatively cheap.  It reprints the sixth and final edition that Burton issued, each edition expanding with afterthoughts by the author.  The original in 1621 was one-half the size of the last edition.
Burton was an Oxford scholar who had spent much of his life in Christ Church College of that institution accumulating quotes, ideas, and general collectible wisdom from the classics.  His self-styled anatomy of the causes of melancholy is both ponderous and witty--quite in tune with Burton's styling himself as "Democritus Junior."  Democritus, you will recall, was a Greek philosopher of the 5th century BC who developed the idea of atoms forming the basis of the universe.  He was also sometimes called the "laughing philosopher" because of his wit.
Burton himself has a good time with this kind of humor, and his book is not at all a gloomy analysis of melancholy.  What it is is a compendium of every kind of thought on the subject, and is replete with Latin quotations and Greek philosophy.  It is a museum of myth, ignorance, and insight.  Written in a uniquely antiquarian style, it is a  treat for the modern reader.  Like Sir Thomas Browne's gothic prose, Burton's is unique as well as intriguing.  His book is meant to be dipped into, not to be read straight through.  The wonderful thing is that it's not just a classic but a readable classic.  It is, yes, antiquarian, but happily antiquarian.
