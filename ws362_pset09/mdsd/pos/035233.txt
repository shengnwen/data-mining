I am a student of economics from Brazil, currently studying at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) and this is the fundamental book of our graduation course of Game Theory. I found it not exceptionally didactic, but that's what I should've waited of a ten-year-old book. Some improvements should be done, with a frendlier layout and a more graphical approach
