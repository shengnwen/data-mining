This book gives a great insight into the excitement of the late 60's, and their less pleasant aftermath.  It's written by David Harris, the famous SDS leader from Stamford who was one of the few to actually go to prison for draft resistance-- in the midst of which he married Joan Baez.  Two other people are described in fascinating detail: Allard Lowenstein, an anti-war Congressman elected in the late 60's, and speaker at my Harvard commencement in 1969; and Dennis Sweeney, activist and Lowenstein protege-- who later murdered Lowenstein.

This is a terrifically writen, hard to put down, account of the hopes and disappointments of the sixties
