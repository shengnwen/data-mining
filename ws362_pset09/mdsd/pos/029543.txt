I am in my late 50's and can't remember the last time I bought a book as it is released.  I always wait for the paperback.  However, after reading the New York Times review of "The Lost," I bought it.  It interested me both as a book about the Holocaust and genealogy.  After finishing the book, I am so thankful that I didn't wait for the paperback.

I admit, Mr. Mendelsohn is quite wordy.  But, his style is that of a man telling his story in a conversation.  As a result, the narrative it quite moving.  I kept finding myself flipping back through the book to re-read passages that moved me.  Finally, I began to dog-ear pages so that my searches would be easier.  While reading some passages, I would walk up to my wife and read them out loud.  I just had to share them with someone.  Memories of my own grandmothers and great-grandmother came flooding back to me as I read what Mr. Mendelsohn wrote about his mother's mother:  "...whom at one point I loved more than anyone else."

Generally, I don't read a book a second time.  I pass it along to others to read.  However, this book is different.  I have talked to several people about how much I enjoyed the book.  But, I didn't offer my copy.  I want to read it again.

I know this review didn't go into the story line.  But many of the other reviews go into quite a bit of detail.  In my review, I wanted to let the reader know how much "The Lost" touched me and hopefully will encourage others to read the book.
