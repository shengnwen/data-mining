This book took me awhile to read because on almost every page I stopped and thought, "That's amazing" or said to my husband "Listen to this.".  The illustrations are beautiful, the writing is clear with careful explanatons of complicated inter-relationships of plants, people, birds, and insects of the tropics.

If you want to be amazed, read this book.

"In many parts of tropical America, Indians have found a remarkable use for these soldier ants as practical first aid.  The ants are picked up by the body and the jaws are placed over an open cut.  The soldier will clamp her mandibles shut, and the Indian promptly twists her head from her body, making an efficient  and readily available emergency suture."

" I was once in a rubber plantation in the lowlands of western Ecuador on a rare day when the sun made regular excursions out from behind the clouds.  Every time the sun appeared, I heard what sounded like shots ringing out from the trees overhead.  The sun was warming up the seed pods, which explosively propelled the walnut-sized seeds as far as thirty feet off. "

"Francis Putz, a botanist who has studied lianas in Panama, has suggested that it may be advantageous for trees to sway out of phase from their neighbors because this would tend to snap vine connections.  Swaying out of phase is best accomplished by evolving different architectures, which in turn result in different flexibilies.  The need for out-of-phase swaying might thus promote an increase in diversity of rain forest trees.....

There is an alternative to swaying.  If swaying fails to shed hangers-on, a tree can prune itself, sending a liana tumbling down into obscurity at little cost to itself by dropping branches and entangled leaves, particularly if these branches and leaves are shaded.
