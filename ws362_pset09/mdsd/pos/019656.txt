I am not normally a reader of ghost stories, or horror.  I have never finished a Stephen King book, because they have not held my interest.  Somehow, though, this ghost story grabbed me, and several times through the course of the book, it really did give me shivers.  

I disagree with the reviewers who didn't like the characters.  I found them satisfyingly likable and felt real, three-dimensional.

Another excellent thing about the book is that the author does seem to really know a lot about music, and what it is like to make music.  Too often, movies or books about musicians ring false, because the process of music-making is portrayed as being all about having a vague sense of "feeling it," or being "carried away." There's some of that here, but this book also has a satisfying sprinkling of things that make me believe that the author has some familiarity with the nitty-gritty details of what musicians actually think about. Time-signatures, chords, bass-lines, scales. I appreciated that.

It wasn't a perfect book.  Shivers aside, the book did not provide a huge amount of fear or suspense.  That said, I still recommend it, and believe I will soon be reading other books by this author
