I definitely see why Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in the world! This is a step-by-step guide on how to create a successful business. Anyone can do it as long as he/she is motivated, dedicated, selfless, flexible, passionate  and a lifetime learner. (Easier said then done, right?!)

I enjoyed the writing style. He wrote personally and I enjoyed the comments provided by the people that he was referring to. It added another personal touch making it seem like Sam was not just making stuff up.

REGARDING SAM
Sam Walton was an amazing man. He was always learning and flexible. He is the role model that many business people should follow in order to be successful. 

TAKE AWAY
Another interesting thing that many of today's CEOs can learn from Sam is to learn from their people. If nothing else, all leaders in all types of organizations can learn from this! (This is actually a cornerstone of my company's philosophy.)

This is definitely another book to add to Esenai's corporate library..
