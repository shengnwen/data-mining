From the title and summary of this book I was expecting a girl power, slightly unrealistic "teen-ish" book; it was quite the opposite. Although the story line is entertaining I find the parallel universe, evil-out-to-get-the-world villain out of place. 

Spy Goddess is entertain but it is not a really believable book. I found it to be a let down because the storyline could not seem to decide between girl power teen fluff, and action packed superhero wannabee novel. The story constantly rotates back and forth between the two.  

This novel would be most entertaining to the preteen (10-12) girls crowd, but is a definite no-way for the boys.
