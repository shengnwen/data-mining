In the short time of applying a handful of these rules in my friendships, I have come to realize how easy it is to make even the most long-standing friendships more profound and interesting. What I loved most of The Art of Friendship is appreciating that we can always make room for new and different relationships. Friendship is about making the simplest of efforts. And with 70 of these efforts now easily outlined for everyone, one can only imagine how the world might become a better place thanks to it being filled with better friends!
