I found an original edition of The Red Napoleon at a used bookstore. Very interesting when looked at as an alternative history, but when it was written it was meant as warning of what might happen. Included excellent maps and orders of battle for the American and Red forces. Very rousing and descriptive scenes of war (especially the Battle for New York City) but racial paranoia keeps this from being a classic
