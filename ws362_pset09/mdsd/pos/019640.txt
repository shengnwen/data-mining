I loved this book.  I had ordered three different books on Alaska Vacations, this one was the best hands down.  It gave me all my options, sample vacations, told me the best and worst of Alaska.  I really feel I can now book my vacation and feel very comfortable.  Going to Alaska is a very expensive vacation, I have waited a lifetime for a trip like this so I wanted to make sure of all my options. This book gave you the pros and cons of cruising, driving, renting an RV, railroads.  Once I got through I knew exactly what was the best option for myself
