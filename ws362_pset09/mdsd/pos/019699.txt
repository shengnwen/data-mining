Rainer Maria Rilke' s exquisite stylistic sobriety and his thought's  deepness  makes of him one of the most absorbing and interesting poets of the second half of the XIX Century. His febrile style contrasts with the delicacy of his verses, loaded of penetrating vision and prolific display of visual images that conveys us with the mythic roots. 

The words in Rilke's  poetic have major expression, density and expression; a strong expansiveness and excel significance. 

His reading is an absolute must for any hard reader I any corner of the world.
