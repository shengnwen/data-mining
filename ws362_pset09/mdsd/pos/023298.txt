I found this book very comprehensible which made for a quick read. The authors even have a sense of humor which made the book more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this text for any reader or student who dreads having to read a dry, standard economics textbook. The examples are witty and relatable, making for an easy, enjoyable read
