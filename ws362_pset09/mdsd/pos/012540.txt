It is hard to grasp how difficult it is to produce a sound single-volume study of the Thirty Years' War.  This continent-wide conflagration engulfed most European states, compelled the resolution of many of the era's crucial issues, and actually extended beyond the conventional time frame of 1618-48.  Writing a book of manageable size thus requires choices, and Geoffrey Parker's are eminently reasonable.  He concentrates on the international political and diplomatic aspects, while including more than enough on religion, economy, the impact of war on society, and  other "background" concerns.  Readers looking here for full-blown accounts of military ops may be chagrined, but this is not the goal of Parker (who wrote most of the text) and his colleagues.  They provide perfectly adequate data on battles and campaigns, deftly locating military affairs within a fully comprehensible framework highlighting great-power rivalry and doctrinal conflict.  The prose is consistently readable, another neat achievement in a multiauthored work, and the many illustrations and maps are a definite plus. For more on actual combat, C.V. Wedgwood's standard "Thirty Years' War" is still a fine description, though much less analytical than Parker's contribution. G. Mortimer, "Eyewitness Accounts of the Thirty Years' War" is recent scholarship (with extensive quotes from primary sources) adding nuance to the older view that the TYW was an unmitigated disaster throughout Germany
