I'm a multi sport athlete who trains all year round regardless of what sport I play.   I bought a few of these Ultimate Guide to Weight Training books, and they definitely helped me train specifically for the different sports that I play.   Then about a year later I received an email from amazon that there was a new edition out.  These upgraded editions are even better than the originals, with more articles and a lot more sport-specific information.   I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who plays a lot of sports or wants to specifically focus on training for one sport in particular
