A swirling canvas of art scams, art history, and Australian attitude is just backdrop. This book is really about two brothers, Slow Bones and Butcher Bones aka Hugh and Michael Boone. One is mentally impaired (he thinks in capital letters and likes to sit on metal folding chairs and watch the traffic go by.) The other is an artist. Each, by his nature, must be different from the rest of the world. Slow Bones can't save himself in social situations or manage city thoroughfares. And Butcher, though more adept, is just as likely to tick everyone off by his insatiable needs to gratify His Art. 

Theft deals with the balance between these two brothers as they ride the seesaw of great art thefts, beautiful women and the international art market. I found it charming and amusing. It was the first book I picked out for my book group ahead of time, showing up for the meeting with six copies tucked under my arm. I have to confess, though, that it wasn't so totally beloved by all.  Ah, well.
