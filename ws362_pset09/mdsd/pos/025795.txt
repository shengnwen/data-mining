I've heard Nick Hornby accurately described as exceptional at relating what it means to be a fan of something: for example, Fever Pitch (football), Songbook (music), and Polysyllabic Spree (books).  This is a short collection of articles Hornby wrote for Believer magazine over a period of about 14 months, each of which begins with a list each of books Hornby bought and read during the month.

In the process, The Polysyllabic Spree accomplishes a few things beyond the obvious of adding to the reader's inevitably already-too-long list of must reads (there's no way that those who picked up this book didn't already have a list): it excerpts particularly interesting books, like a literary sample platter; it compares books to other cultural media and explains why and how literature beats movies and film almost every time; and it recounts some amusing anecdotes about Hornby's writing career and first glimpses of associated fame.  Most importantly, the Spree offers great commentary on the compulsive allure of reading- nay, of book purchasing (and then reading)- and of the acceptable snobbishness associated with selectively accepting book recommendations, reading, and literary criticism.  Hornby is both passionate and opinionated on the subject, and reveals his personal literary ethic throughout the Spree: he treats personal book recommendations with suspicion, hates Amazon reviewers, and seeks to avoid too familiar subject matter (e.g., autism (he has an autistic son)) and writing styles (just as he prefers others' cooking style to his own).  

The book suggestions are fantastic, notwithstanding an emphasis on obscure older British authors.  Hornby abided by the Believer's editors' review rules, one of which was emphasizing only the positive in his selected books, so almost every book listed in the Spree comes recommended.  [The book's title comes from Hornby's hilarious send-up of the editorial staff, which he pictures as "twelve rather eerie young men and women, all dressed in white robes and smiling maniacally, like a sort of literary equivalent of the Polyphonic Spree."]  I now have a whole lot of book picks that I wouldn't otherwise be aware of, and if that's not enough, the Spree-recommended "So Many Books" (Gabriel Zaid), might pick up where this one left off.
