     At first I wasn't crazy about the book.  I first read Le Petit Prince in my Grade 12 French class.  I thought it was going to be a little silly story.  Well, I learned 2 lessons--don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a book until you have finished reading it!  I found that this story, with its silly characters and planets, held a deep message that not even a highly philosophical book could express.  The story is a refreshing change--one with characteristics of a children's story and yet one with a serious message for "les grandes personnes"!  It really grew on me!  So I encourage you, when reading the book to: sit back and relax, rediscover your imagination and learn a lesson or two!!
