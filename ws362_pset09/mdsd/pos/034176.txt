As an executive that has successfully led two organizations in the transition to agile development techniques, I think Sanjiv has highlighted the most important ingredient in an agile transition...LEADERSHIP. If you want to understand how to manage agile projects, you will find it in this book. More importantly, if you want to know what is going to be expected of someone leading the transition, you will also find it here. Sanjiv gives a clear description of what an agile project looks like from the perspective of the people working in the environment. From the executive to the individual contributor, he describes the patterns that a good agile environment displays. In my presentations and writing that I've done in the agile community, I constantly stress the need for good leadership in driving the culture changes necessary for a successful move to agile practices. This book describes the leadership behaviors that need to be exercised by the change agent.
