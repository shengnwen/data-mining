There is that silly cult movie about wrestling called "Vision Quest" where Elmo (J.C. Quinn) talks to Louden (Mathew Modine) who is not going to wrestle the meanest (you know what) wrestler in the valley, and J. C. Quinn talks about Pele, scoring an impossible goal, on his back, turned the other way, and he tells Louden that for one moment that effort raised the human spirit. Allright. Granted, kind of silly. And Louden eventually beats Shute which is a turnabout as if George Custer won. But don't forget the picture had a very hot Linda Fiorentino which made up for a few gaps in the believability quotient.

Well, anyhow, that's why we watch sports. It's not the Michael Jordon or the Emmit Smith or even (I'm trying to think of a baseball player but the sport is in shambles) . . . , it's Jimmy Valvano at the Wolfback never expecting to win. It's the autistic high school boy who plays in the last game of his senior year and scores more than 20 points in 8 minutes. It's the beauty of the sport, the tension, the pressure, the sadness. Hate to say it, but it really is the joy of victory and the agony of defeat.

I think Feinstein delivers. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
