This book is a hybrid, essentially a compilation of some of Marsden's shorter writings.  The opening sections are concise narratives of the development of the fundamentalist movement from the post-Civil War period to the recent past.  This is essentially a distillation of Marsden's more extensive narration presented in some of his other books.  Marsden covers the shock of the Civil War, the impact of rapid urbanization, industrialization, and the influx of non-Protestant immigrants.  This is followed by the debate over liberalization or modernization of the Protestant churches with the hiving off of more conservative, fundamentalist oriented movements.  Marsden has a nice intermixture of theological, social, and political history in these chapters.  The second half of the book is a series of topical essays on issues related to the history of the modern evangelical movement.  These include the political involvement  of evangelicals, the relationship between evangelical movements and modern science, and an insightful essay on the maverick theologian, J. Gresham Machen. Like all of Marsden's work, this book is written well and quite thoughtful.  For individuals interested in a good precis of the relevant history of the modern evangelical movement and the shifting relationships of evangelicals to political activity, this is an excellent book.
