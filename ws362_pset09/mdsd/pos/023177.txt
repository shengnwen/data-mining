M.C. is looking for a new job and is also trying to get away from a boyfriend who had been abusive in the past.  M.C. is pursued relentlessly by a stalker in the story, and quickly several murder victims are found, all from the Houston area.  Fearing that M.C. is in danger, Dr. Lamerino is anxious to find the murderer and put him or her behind bars
