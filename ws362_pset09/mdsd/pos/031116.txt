This is the first novel by Mr. Doolittle I've read -- an impressive,
first-rate read. His characterization (including a romance) and
setting (rural Nebraska) are dead on. The title concerns an
ex-reporter from Chicago returning home to run his late
grandfather's canoe/outdoor expedition camp. Our hero runs into
local nasties including a vicious deputy sheriff. The pacing is
smart and the dialogue is seamless. The narrative stays on
course and doesn't drift. IMO, one of the best books I've read
this year.
