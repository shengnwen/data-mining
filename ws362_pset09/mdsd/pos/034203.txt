I thought this book was amazing. The author gives you a lot of random information during the beginning half of the novel, but once 
you have reached towards the end of the book all of this information falls into place. I loved the ending. It was terrific. The last sentence of the novel even somes up the whole book, and really connects to the very beginning of the novel. I loved this book so much that if I was introduced to it out of my english class 
I would still have read it
