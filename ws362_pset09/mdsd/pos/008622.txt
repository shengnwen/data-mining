I needed to use this for a graduate level course. For that, I thought it was less than suitable. But this is a solid history, that gives some depth on a popular level. It's aimed at a general audience, and has little citation of direct sources. Still, Johnson is a solid historian, and I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in the history of the Christian faith and church
