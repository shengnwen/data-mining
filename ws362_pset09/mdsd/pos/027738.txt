"The Wild Girl" is a beautiful tale of the clash between two cultures.

An orphaned youth with a talent for photography goes west to join an expedition being set up to recover the son of a wealthy landowner, kidnapped by the Apache. That the story takes place in 1932 rather than earlier in time immediately sets it apart from your standard western. But, it is a historical fact a band of Apache did jump their reservation in Arizona and survived into the 20th century in the Sierra Madre.

Fergus deftly portrays the divisions (and similarities) between the hunters and the Indians. The line between heroes and villains is a thin one given all have the same human motivations.

To be successful, a historical novel must transport the reader to another time and place. Fergus succeeds in doing so. In an author's note, he reveals the seed for the novel was planted when an elderly Mexican told him about a young Apache girl who was captured in the mountains and brought to his village in the 1930s. The old man expressed shame over the treatment of the girl and didn't tell what became of her. Imagination provided Fergus with an answer to that question.

Another writer might have provided a different answer. Fergus gives one that is primarily satisfactory. An experienced outdoorsman, he is able to adequately convey the landscape in which the story takes place. There are a few places where coincidence does threaten acceptance, particularly in the budding relationship between Ned and the girl. But, on the whole, imagination, research and experience have combined to provide an acceptable reality and a thumping good read.
