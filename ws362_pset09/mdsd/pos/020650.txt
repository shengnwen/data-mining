A great night table book, it is arranged in short, alphabetical entries that can be read quickly.  The authors seem uniquely suited to their subject-matter and obviously know their stuff.  But, while they try to cite passages from the books as much as possible, most of the material just doesn't apply.  JK Rowling seems to have skimmed a volume like this, then put it into a blender and extracted her own take on it all.  It's liable to make purists a tad angry.  It's all very interesting in its own right, though.  I would have liked a lot more info on the "real" stuff, and less of a stretch to make it applicable
