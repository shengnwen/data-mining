Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! by George Rable is an excellent overview of an often overlooked campaign. Mr Rable's book, while not a military history, is a wonderfully writeen and easy to read book on the Fredericksburg Campaign. It starts off with Burnside replacing McClellan and ends with Burnside's dismissal after the infamous Mud March. If you want a great overall read on the entire campaign this book is for you. If you want a miltary history of the campaign then I would suggest Francis O'Reilly's Fredericksburg Campaign: Winter War on the Rappahannock. O'Reilly's book is almost a minute by minute, blow by blow of the battle, while Rable's is a remarkable overview of the entire campaign from beginning to bitter end. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the campaign and I would suggest O'Reilly's with this one by Mr Rable
