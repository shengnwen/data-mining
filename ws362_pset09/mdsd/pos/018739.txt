After reading The Secret History, Donna Tartt's amazing debut novel that I remember devouring in nearly one sitting, I was thrilled to find that after a decade, the author had published a second novel, The Little Friend. I bought The Little Friend shortly after its publication, but before reading it, I ended up loaning the book out to a good friend. After the book came back to me, it continued to sit on my bookshelf unread for a few more years. In the meantime, I read reviews of The Little Friend on (...) and was sad to read a number of reviewers panned the novel, and ripped Ms. Tartt a new colon because they felt the book had a weak ending and was light on plot. In contrast, somewhere along the way I recall reading, perhaps in Entertainment Weekly, that Stephen King thought that The Little Friend was even better written than the author's first novel.  

Anyway, I finally got around to reading The Little Friend at the beginning of this year. I found the novel to be very dense with description, causing the action scenes to move rather slowly and to lose some suspensefulness, making this a slow read for me (it took me over a month to finish the 555-page novel). I was, however, BLOWN AWAY by Ms. Tartt's writing style! She really is a gifted writer! Her development of her characters, as well as the setting descriptions were nothing short of CINEMATIC in their intensity. I LOVED this novel! I think with a little tweaking, The Little Friend could make a fantastic screenplay for a movie. I look forward to Ms. Tartt's next novel, and I fervently hope that it will not be much longer of a wait.

P.S. I did not dislike the ending at all! This was a character-driven literary-styled Southern Gothic novel. To be honest with you, I thought this book was much better written than The DaVinci Code, which I thought was a boring read with two-dimensional characters. But that's just me. Obviously I'm in the minority on that one.
