I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book.
She's done an excellent job portraying the life of a military wife, with all its ups and downs, in a way that can't help but make you laugh. She mentioned so many things I miss about being surrounded by military in the "fishbowl" of a military community. Every story reminded me of my own experience--the "raisin on the butt, the hairstylist, the chickpea and okra quiche." They were all too funny because they are so real. Thanks for writing this so I could always be reminded of such treasured memories.
