This is a fantastic novel... it is so well written. You are transported to a village during the bubonic plague. 

The descriptions are fantastic, the drama, the pain, the fear, tenderness, caring, worries, and above it all, the confusion of the bubonic plague in England. 

Some parts are a bit crude and the end is too abrupt and simplistic for the depth and richness of the novel. A 5 star rating without the last 15 pages.

Great reading it along with Galileo's daughter -about the same time, but in Italy.
