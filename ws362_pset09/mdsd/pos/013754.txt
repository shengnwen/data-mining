i think that this book is a great book because it can put kids to sleep and let them try to read on there own.When kids try to read on there own it can let them have a felling for themselfs that they are doing something great and it's all by themselfs.Sometimes when i read this book to people in my family it seems to make there faces light up with joy whenever i pull this book out.I hope that you love this book and so does your child
