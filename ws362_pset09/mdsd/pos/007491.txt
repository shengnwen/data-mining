This is the classical translation. It has no commentary and has aged rather well with the language has good flow and clear albeit older english.

IF you only have one translation of Holy quran this is the one. Other common one is Abdullah Yusuf Ali's translation.  I would stay away from Rev Arberry's (a racist orientalist missionary) translation.
