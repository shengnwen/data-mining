I like the exam notes series of books. I read the MCSE 4.0 and this one for the CCNP 2.0 and liked both. I don't like that Sybex makes it difficult to save their PDF file to your hard drive for easier access. With this one you must have the CDROM in the drive to use the online form of the book. That bugs! The material was good. I did like the electronic flash cards on the CD. They weren't too in depth but they did make you think about specific critical subjects. I thought the routing section was as good as their routing study guide book. 4 Stars
