This book made me listen. It says we may be facing another energy crisis like that of the 1970s, but more severe. We didn't work toward an intelligent solution when we had time, despite Jimmy Carter's moral equivalent of war (MEOW) message, we haven't made a smooth and safe transition to other forms of energy, and are now letting world economics control our destiny. The required, unpleasant changes will be forced on us rather than us managing them. Government only knows to keep the old, unworkable solutions alive. Individuals can try to scale down their living habits or flee to the mountains, but there are now six billion of us rather than the 1 billion that were around when people could survive on the land. People who think ethanol, wind, solar and firewood will save the day for us, should share what they're smoking. (Maybe nuclear will save us if we embrace it now). Of course angry prophets, like Shakespeare's fools, are half-crazy. They always have been. We need them. Otherwise, nobody listens
