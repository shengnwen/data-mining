Okay -- having read every single one of Barry's books, I'd agree that this is not his absolute funniest, but I still laughed out loud every other page or so.  I consider Barry the most hilarious writer alive, bar none.  This  may not be his funniest book, but it's still funnier than 99% of the other  books out there
