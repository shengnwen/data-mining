Travel Team is written by Mike Lupica. This story is about a boy named Danny Walker. He is very short, but an extremely good basketball player. He tries out for the Vikings, a travel team, which he has been on previously. But this year, he gets cut because of his small size. His dad, an alcoholic who led the same team to the national championships when he was a kid, visits and puts together a team, the Warriors, of kids that didn't make the Vikings. They start out as a horrible team, but eventually an athletic girl joins. This helps the team in various ways. To make the situation better, Danny's friend also decides to join, quitting the travel team. The Warriors End up beating the Vikings in the play-offs.
The story takes place in present day. The settings of are at Danny's house and at St. Pat's gym. Danny practices on his basketball hoop outside, chats with his friends online, or talks directly with his friends and family about upcoming basketball games. At the gym, Danny and his team play in either a game or a practice. Sometimes Danny goes there to think or to watch other practices from a small sliding window on the stage in the gym.
The theme of the story is that if you put your mind to it, you can do anything. Danny, a 55 inch seventh grader, was cut from a travel team, but he focused on his game and was placed on a team that his father put together and beating the travel team. If you believe it, you can achieve it.
I would give this book a four star rating, because overall, it was a great story. Although in a few chapters, I was bored because there were too many details. The story made it fairly easy to paint a mental picture, and I usually knew what was happening in the book. It was an enjoyable book and I would recommend it to others.
