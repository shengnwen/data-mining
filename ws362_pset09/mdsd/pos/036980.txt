I read this book when my son was 17, I was a single Mom going through alot of pain, Barbara helped me to have faith and look to God for all of my trials. He was very rebellious but reading this book helped me to hang on, sometimes only by a thread. I must say, being at the brink of suicide, Barbara was my life-saver and best friend. I would read it over and over and a wave of peace would come over me, the book was written under the teaching of the Holy Spirit and I have read many of her other books and combined works, all of her writings have helped me immensely. They have helped me to see that I am not alone in my pain. God bless you Barbara. I even laughed when I thought I could not laugh, and alot of tears were shed, liquid prayers to God. You will love this book, especially if you are a Mother of teens who are rebellious
