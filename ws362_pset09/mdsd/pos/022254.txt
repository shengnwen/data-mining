I thought this was an enjoyable story.  It was an easy read and the characters were very likeable and had good chemistry.  However, it is very reminicent of "Paradise", following almost the exact same storyline.  I loved "Paradise", reading it for the 3rd time just before reading this one.  But reading this I had the feeling that I was reading a copy-cat of "Paradise".  I did feel like the story wrapped up a little too quickly, like the ending was written hastily.  I don't think that it is classic, brilliant McNaught, but I enjoyed it anyway and do recommend it!  I am looking forward to Holly Braxton's story, "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" and hope that McNaught lets us know how Kate and Mitchell are doing
