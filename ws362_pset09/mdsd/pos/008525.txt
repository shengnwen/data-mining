I have enjoyed this book, it is an extremely fast reading book.  While there are not super revalations in this book, Paula Froelich will remind you of many things that we already know.  She starts off with 10 basic rules of fame:
1.  Find out what your good at, and do it.
2.  Don't try to fake a talent you really don't have.
3.  Don't know what your good at?  Ask someone to help figure that out.
4.  Learn to enjoy the spotlight: Be the star of your own stage.
5.  Educate yourself.  Knowledge is power.
6.  Formulate a plan of attack and stick to it.
7.  If you want it enough, you an get it - but don't sell yourself short.
8.  Never be mean to waiters - what comes around goes around.
9.  People are going to hate you, so have a hide like a rhino - and above all, don't give them a reason to bring you down.
10.  If you aren't going to do something - stop complaining and stay home.  
After these 10 rules, she goes over the 9 secrets of the rich and famous.  She places everything together in an easy to read, and very fast paced style.    This really makes for a great afternoon read!  Its definately worth picking up and refreshing ourselves on what our real goals and asprirations are, and giving us all a little insight in how behave in the world of people.
