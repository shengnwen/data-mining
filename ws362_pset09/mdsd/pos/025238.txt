First of all, "The Wonder Spot" is NOT "chick lit," a phrase I find very demeaning, and that appears on the professional reviews of this book. It is a well-written, thoughtful and thought-provoking look at one woman's life from childhood to mid-thirties, from her own perspective.

I had the good fortune of hearing Sophie Applebaum's adventures read aloud by the author herself, in the audio version. Banks' strangely flat intonation and unaccountable pauses fit the heroine's affect perfectly, I thought, and this added to my enjoyment of the book. There were so many hilarious episodes with which I could relate: most especially Sophie stuck in Hebrew School without an ounce of "correct" Jewish sensibility in her soul, and a fervent wish to escape at any cost. Been there, done that! Her many dead-end jobs in publishing also rang a very true bell for me; ALSO been there done that.

The book is really a loosely tied-together series of short stories, or vignettes, that take us very convincingly through Sophie's life, not always necessarily in chronological order. We meet her brothers and her mother and her father the judge; we get to know her quintissential jewish grandmothers (rang VERY true) and her friends and many boyfriends.

What I did NOT like about the character, and what was never adequately explained, at least to me, was Sophie's obdurate dumbness. I kept waiting for her to wake up and accept her own intelligence and be a "mensch"--she never did. She was as dumb about herself at 35 as she was at 13, and it simply didn't ring true. It was terribly annoying because it was never sufficiently explained.

That having been said, however, I would highly recommend this book as a fine written work, not a fluffy "chick lit" throwaway
