The main character of this book, Dr. John Berry, seems a heck of a lot like Robin Cook's Jack Stapleton.  In fact, this book is a lot like a Cook novel except the conspirators that are usually after the hero as he methodically pieces together the clues, are noticeably missing from this book.  

Berry is investigating the death of a rich college co-ed who died from an apparent botched abortion.  Berry's friend who clandestinely does abortions (this is the pre-Roe vs. Wade era) is the main suspect.  Berry uses his medical credentials and general ability to intimidate people to interview everyone that might have known the co-ed or who could be a lead to where she went to have her procedure done.

The author gives a lot of explanation to many medical terms and the book is a fairly quick read.  I would have rated it higher but I felt that the lack of the suspense that normally exists in a Robin Cook novel where the main character has to fight the bad guys, slightly detracted from the book.
