I've read about 10 of Stephen King's novels, and this one is my favorite. This riveting story of survival is scarier than most of his books dealing with the supernatural. The main character, a 9 year-old girl, comes alive in this great little novel. I strongly recommend this to both teens and adults, even those who would never think of reading a Stephen King novel because of his normal genre. If you like scary novels, or books about wilderness survival, you'll love this one. If you have some interest in baseball, it makes this even better
