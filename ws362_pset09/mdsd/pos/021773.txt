As a R.N. with 30 years experience, I look forward to Echo Heron's books because they depict the profession of nursing truthfully and with humor.  I was not at all disappointed with this current release.  Ms. Heron has put together a book of interviews with nurses that is fast-paced, gives such an interesting history of the profession, and aptly depicts nursing as the part of medicine that still focuses on advocacy and compassion.  I am proud to be a nurse, and even more proud that there are people like Echo Heron who continue to speak out in favor of good patient care and bringing caring back to the practice of medicine.  This is a book that is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone in the medical field, while &quot;lay&quot; people will also find it totallly absorbing and impossible to put down
