Those who begin this book hoping for another untold adventure of Sherlock Holmes may be puzzled or disappointed at first. But I hope they'll stay with it, because it's a deeply moving story, a meditation on age, memory, and identity. The three storylines interweave & fade into one another, just as Holmes' waning faculties drift & wander. His own awareness of his decline is heartbreaking, yet he handles it with grace & dignity. Whether his defenses against that decline demand too heavy a personal price is for the reader to decide.

Still, this isn't just a tale of old age & its inexorable erosion, however beautifully told -- it's an investigation into the mysteries that not even a mind as keen & brilliant as that of Sherlock Holmes can hope to solve. The mystery of meaning, the mystery of loneliness, and the final mystery of death -- these are the mysteries Holmes faces, only to find himself as baffled by their impenetrability as any of us. When you reach the final page, you'll be left with a feeling of thoughtful melancholy, as well as an urge to confront those mysteries yourself. A rich, memorable novel, most highly recommended
