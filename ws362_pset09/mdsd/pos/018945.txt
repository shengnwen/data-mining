C IS FOR CORPSE is an interesting diversion from the normal mystery outline. Usually the client dies somewhere during the investigation instead of at the beginning. Leave it up to Sue Grafton to make a u-turn away from the norm, and the readers love it!

In C IS FOR CORPSE Kinsey meets a guy at a gym who is trying to rehabilitate himself after a life threatening car accident in which his Porsche was forced over a cliff. Standard criteria applies to this story: He has no memory of the accident, doesn't know why someone would want to kill him, and he feels like someone is watching him and will try again. Kinsey agrees to help, and then he is killed. 

This is the first time we get a glimpse at the loyalty that is synonymous with Kinsey Millhone. Even though her client is dead, she's determined to find his killer, after all she had agreed to do the job and that's her goal. Grafton takes us on the journey and the pace is excellent. She keeps you intrigued until the last page and you understand that these mysteries are something that you will continue to read
