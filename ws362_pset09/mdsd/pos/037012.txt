There have been so many excellent reviews of this book that I will not exhaust the subject. My complaints are two. First, the comprehensiveness of the book seems to require a better organizing principle. MacCulloch sweeps us from one end of Europe to another over a period of several hundred years, attempting to interweave all the related events, with the result that if you're not a historian and haven't prepared yourself with visual aids, you will want to tear out your hair. It was impossible for me to keep track of all the rulers, dynasties, popes, wars, battles, doctrines, pronouncements, and sects--no matter how many times the author repeated them, which he did, often. A series of chronologies concentrating on particular geographical areas would probably have been easier for me to absorb.

My second quibbhle is exactly that. My paperback edition has a quote on the cover from Karen Armstrong praising the book's impartiality. It's not impartial, though. MacCulloch is quite obviously a partisan of the reformed Protestant cause and has little patience for Roman Catholic display, hierarchy, and theology. (I won't go into specifics here; suffice it to say that if an author can prefer one religion's style of BELL RINGING, for goodness sakes, I think we can safely assume he's partisan.) I don't care; he has a right to his opinion and he's not hiding it. I just wish the publisher had omitted the Armstrong quote, as it really does misrepresent the book's perspective
