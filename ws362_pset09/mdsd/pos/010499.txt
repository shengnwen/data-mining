When I see my actions within the scope of the five thousand year pattern of Empire's advantaged position in human affairs, I recognize a strange new sense of optimism (like a child finds upon climbing an especially old and gnarly but obviously healthy tree): I dare dream that my neighbors and I may one day work together to decide our mutual fate, and grow to forget the times when we allowed a parade of wealthy charlatans to play us for fools.  Thank you, David Korten, for your wonderful synthesis of your own important work along with that of Joanna Macy, Riane Eisler, and many others.  I think you're right: the long view is our only reliable map forward.   May others share your vision
