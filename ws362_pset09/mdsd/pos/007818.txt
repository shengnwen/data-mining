Good Hair gives a new prospective that I think a lot of people will be able to relate to.  I could relate to Alice's background and how she grew up, the way people looked at her and who they expected her to be.  Good Hair was like a breath of fresh air for me because I have and am going through the same things.  I understand what it's like to be so completely caught up in what people expect and want you to be that you totally forget who you are and sometimes question if you ever knew.  I like the fact that it came from a middle and upper-middle class background.  I feel like that characteristic sets it apart from a lot of other novels.  Believe it or not, their are black people like these characters in America, even though we don't read about them too often.  I thought it was a great read and I recommend it to EVERYBODY!!
