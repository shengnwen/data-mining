Henry Veatch's RATIONAL MAN is both an introduction to ethics and an introduction to Aristotelian ethics.  Although published in 1962, the book remains one of the best introductions to ethics.  It's written in non-technical language and contains plenty of examples from literature and life.

Following Aristotle, Veatch develops a theory of ethics broadly within the natural law tradition.  Contrary to the skeptical or relativistic approach, man can have ethical knowledge.  Ethics is based on human nature and the goal ("end") of man's life determines what is right.  For man, that end is "intelligent living" or the "examined life."  Veatch disagrees with Aristotle, however, in arguing that a life of contemplation is not ethically superior to intelligence applied to the problems of everyday life.

Along the way, Veatch discusses a number of questions and counterarguments, such as the "is/ought" problem, utilitarianism, whether a belief in moral absolutes leads to intolerance, and the possibility of ethics without God.  In a few places I thought Veatch skimmed over objections too lightly (for example, the obvious counterargument that crooks like Goebbels and Stalin were intelligent in their own way), but this is a minor complaint.

The Liberty Fund edition contains a useful introduction by Douglas Rasmussen.  Veatch (1911-1999) was an important voice in the twentieth century Aristotelian renaissance and those who know him only through this book will be impressed with his list of publications in most areas of philosophy
