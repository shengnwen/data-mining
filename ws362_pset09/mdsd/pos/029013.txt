With Spielberg's new film adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS in theatres, more attention is being paid to both the original Wells novel, and the infamous 1938 Welles radio broadcast.  If you're interested in both, why not treat yourself to the best presentation of either version available today?  

THE COMPLETE WAR OF THE WORLDS is an excellent book.  It reprint the complete, unedited novel; prints the entire script to the radio play; and comes with a CD containing the entire radio play broadcast, plus archival materials such as the only interview Wells and Welles did together on the topic.  [The recording sound quality is the best I've ever discovered for this play, BTW.]  In addition, the book has lots of great historical and biographical material, including articles looking at the lives of both Wells and Welles; the story of the radio broadcast and the panic it caused; and a survey of the many incarnations of WotW in literature, film, and television.   

If you have any curiosity about the book or the radio play, do yourself a favor and buy this book.  It's worth it
