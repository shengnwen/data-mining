It's true that Laurie King has never quite equaled The Beekeeper's Apprentice, but I don't really hold that against her. How could she equal that original book of the series? What's is important is that she's consistently entertaining, and that she is, even if she hasn't quite equaled her greatest moment. I have enjoyed every Mary Russell novel. Each novel has its constant joys, particularly the magnificent (particularly for genre literature) characterizations of Holmes and Russell. Under King's pen, Holmes becomes more human. With the development of the relationship between him and Russell, Holmes becomes much more than a rational machine. There's some actual character growth here. Of course, Mary Russell is quite the character as well. Laurie King also has the ability to throw in large plot twists that drive the Sherlock Holmes mystery to new places. In O Jerusalem, it is setting of the story in the post-World War I Middle East that makes this original. The clash of cultures, ample dose of history, the harsh living conditions all add to the adventure. In particular, O Jerusalem is made strong by the introduction of two characters, Mahmoud and Ali, who are compelling in their own ways. My one problem with the novel is that there is an enormous buildup and a somewhat weaker ending than is expected. Overall though, it is still an excellent read. The historical setting and the strong characters keep this series strong.
