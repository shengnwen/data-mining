To get full benefit of this resource I recommend perusing a copy of Ben Yagoda's About Town: The New Yorker and the World it Made. It highlights all the worthwhile authors and articles that appeared during this period.  It also provides a lot of context that would not otherwise be available.  For example, the famous one story issue of John Hersey's Hiroshima sold out at the newsstands and the entire piece was broadcast on ABC and BBC radio!  But then there's also the info that Hersey wrote an earlier piece on John Kennedy's war adventure's that helped make him famous.  (The tale was later told as PT-109).  It's little tidbits like that that make this book so valuable as a companion volume
