My wife and I love it, but more importantly our kid.  This is a fantastic story about a family with 7 children who are all picky eaters.  It's told in rhyme as a large poem, and the rhythm seems to help sustain interest in the story, which can seem a little long at bedtime, but is great nonetheless.  Highly recommended
