As I was reading some of these reviews I have noticed that many- teachers, kids, parents are saying that this book is way too "mature", "fake", "absurd".  But no this is not true.  I'm sure Spinelli's intention in writing this book was to not make 9th grade guys sound like pigs only thinking about breasts, hickeys, sex, smoking, beer, and other things that we have gone through with in our childhood.  I feel that Spinelli tried to relate, doing something a great author can only do, to the troubles and worries that a 9th grader goes through.  It is a great book and I would reccommend it to guys maybe 13-15 that maybe dont pick up too many books.  I do not think though, that it is geared towards girls for the fact that it tooks about boobs, and Jason's troubles in not being able to get his tounge through the "Berlin Wall" of Marceline's teeth
