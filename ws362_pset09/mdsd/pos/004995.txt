Always love the way she writes and was not disappointed!  Although it is a continuation of a series, you do not have to read previous ones to understand the characters.  In fact, I was able to find an older book in the series AFTER reading this and was STILL engaged in the plot! Enjoy her banter and descriptions of people and old items.  Looking forward to reading another Mary Kay Andrews book soon.  Keep 'em coming
