Considering the unbelievably wide range of the material in this book there is a very surprising lapse in it. Professor Wilson quotes the great mathematician Hilbert as saying "We must know, we will know" as if the statement is still viable. This is precisely the quote often used when describing G�del's discovery of incompleteness in mathematics that demolished Hilbert's prediction. Wilson never mentions G�del in this book. I don't know how widespread the effort is, but I do know that people in the University of Vienna are very interested in extending G�del's result to other fields of knowledge. Imagine a future in which Wilson's dream of the complete unity of knowledge is achieved, but it is a unity of components each of which will be shown to be permanently incomplete.
