 The main theme of this book is a series of arguments that we should conduct our business dealings more like interpersonal rather than adversarial relationships. In our interpersonal relations, we tend to damp down our disagreements, as we never know what will happen in the future. We rarely burn our interpersonal bridges, for the person that you cheat, call a name or make an obscene gesture to may be the one who interviews you for a job sometime in the future. 
 Most of us have taken a course in basic business, and the first thing you are told is to write and sign a contract. This is of course true, but it also overstates the value of a written contract relative to other aspects of the relationship. While a contract documents the responsibilities and expectations of both parties, there is a great deal of flexibility, even when they are lengthy and rigid. Furthermore, this principle says nothing about how to earn the trust needed to get someone to agree to a contract or how to negotiate a viable contract.
 There are four introspective skills that the authors put forward to help you learn how to have more of a collaborative mindset. They are:

*) Collaborative intention.
*) Truthfulness.
*) Self-accountability.
*) Self-awareness and awareness of others.

 Each of these skills is necessary for a successful collaboration. You first must want to collaborate and be honest with yourself and others regarding what you want and what you are willing to do. After that, you must follow through, making sure that you are holding up your end of the bargain. Finally, you must honestly appraise your performance and also be aware of how you perceive others and how they perceive you. There are many exercises that will allow you to honestly examine how well you perform in collaborative efforts.
 The heart of the book is a theory called Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation (FIRO) and is based on unmet emotional needs. We are all human beings and we take our emotions with us wherever we go and into whatever we do. This test is offered for free on the companion website, and you can obtain a personal relationship profile. It will help you determine if you are willing to give up enough control over events so that you can have effective collaborative relationships. 
 It is our ego and emotions that sustain us in life, motivating us to succeed and strive to do better. No company is an island; everyone must work with others to get what they want. This book will show you how to submerge the aspects of your ego and emotions that can poison your collaborative well and I strongly recommend that everyone in business read it.
