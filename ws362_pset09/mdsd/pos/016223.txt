I like Rebecca's Pocket and have been considering starting my own blog so I purchased this book.  The best thing about this book is that Rebecca is obviously very enthusiastic aboout blogging, especially about what it can do for the confidence and writing abilities of the blogger.  The book gives some practical questions potential bloggers need to ask themselves before starting a blog.  The only reason this book isn't rated higher is that it is a little outdated - but it still has good information.  

Did I end up starting a blog after reading a book?  Not yet.  I still haven't been able to answer for myself the question posed by Rebecca, "If you spend 8 hours + a day in front of the computer for work, are you willing to spend an additional few hours in front of a computer at home writing your blog?
