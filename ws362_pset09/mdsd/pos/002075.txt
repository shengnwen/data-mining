This is my first time to read this author and I thoroughly enjoyed Step Ball Change.  Her characters are believable and recognizable.  Take the time to read this one...you'll recognize your own family members in this story.  I couldn't keep myself from reading parts out loud to my husband as I raced through this book.  I'll definitely read her other books
