8.8 STARS OUT OF 10!!!

I remember getting this book for Christmas about 6 or 7 years ago and reading a good chunk of it with what sounded like WW3 going on in the background.  I quickly finished it a day or two later and I remember liking it.  Unless you are 10 years old right now, or were kidnapped and held in a basement for the last 20 years, I'm sure you have read the book, seen the movie, or at least heard of Cujo.  A big happy 200 pound Saint Bernard gets rabies, turns evil, and terroizes a small Maine town.

On my second read this book had a little more then that. It was more then just a story of a rabid dog.  This book is also the story of a few different small town families dealing with their problems written in a way only Stephen King can.  As usual the character development is great and a handful of Dead Zone characters and mentionings give it a nice touch
