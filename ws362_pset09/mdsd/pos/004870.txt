Gemmell's genius for storytelling is again beautifully demonstrated in this book, the second in this wonderful series. I had become disappointed with modern fantasy and Gemmell came to the rescue! Once again the  characters are so real you believe in them and the story just makes you  feverishly turn the pages to see what comes next. Do yourself a favour and  read this series, which begins with &quot;Ghost King&quot;
