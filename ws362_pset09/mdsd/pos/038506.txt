I differ from the previous reviewer who considers this book too technical. This book isn't technical enough. It lacks the technical information for the serious artist to decide if the cited formulas suit his needs.

For example, the section on the "Drying time of medium, glazes, and varnishes" doesn't tell you how the tested formulas were drying. Were these formulas drying on a hot day or on a cold day? Temperature makes an enormous difference on a formula's drying time. How thickly painted where these formulas? This too makes an enormous difference. Were these formulas tested after being mixed with paints? Or were they tested straight, no chaser?  We might be artists; but we are still smart enough to comprehend, and need, basic and useful "technical" information.

It would also be helpful if the author cited the sources of his formulas. When I read about a formula in the book, I like to know which artists used the forumla so that I can see if their paintings are still intact. As the author didn't cite the sources of his formulas, I have no way of knowing if the formulas are archival or fugitive, and if I should trust them. I mean, the formulas could well have been copied from Francisco Pacheco's once authoritative painting manual - a book that recommends such dubious formulas as using olive oil in gessoes.

You will notice that there aren't many surviving Pachecos in the museums.

With these said, this book is perhaps among the most useful painting formulas books available. A serious and experienced artist can, to some degree, decipher if these formulas are archival based on their ingredients. In contrast, an inexperienced artist would be at a lost as to which formulas to trust.
