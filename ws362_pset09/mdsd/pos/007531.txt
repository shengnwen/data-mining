This is a well-written book that tracks three "cold cases" of disappearance and/or murder on converging tracks. The protagonist is a former policeman who is now a private investigator, and he becomes involved in two of the cases (the third one, about a murdered husband, appears to stand alone). Although the book eventually unravels what happened in each case, I wasn't particularly satisfied in the way everything appeared to work out. There were just too many coincidences: I felt I was reading a poor imitation of a Thomes Hardy novel. The writing is very well done, and the wit and humor comes through quite well, but I do believe this could have been a better book
