Weinstein's _Positive Magic_ would be a great introduction into the occult.  Her explainations of what magick is, how it works, and the individual's role in the cosmos are excellent.  Her gentle demeanor can be taken as "fluffy," but it is meant well.  I did have some disagreement when she said that "witches never go widdershins," and the emphasis on the I Ching was not wholly to my taste. 

For those who have been practicing for awhile, _Positive Magic_ refreshes, her discssion of "the word of truth," and the chapter on "Widening the Circle" are both excellent.  A worthwhile read
