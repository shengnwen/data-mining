I happened to pick up this small volume while on holiday, and although otherwise I would not have read it, I must say that it was a perfect book for a hot June day. 

This is, seemingly, a collection of short stories about the inhabitants of one Manhattan building. They are young, successful, and on the surface look like typical smooth, rich New Yorkers without problems greater than where to go out in the evening. As the book progresses, however, it becomes obvious that they are not so typical (or maybe they are? Because what is typical, in fact?) and all of them have secrets or obsessions, or at least peculiarities, which unassuming neighbors would not think of.

The first few stories introduce the characters more than contribute to the overall plot (and that is why they may seem weaker than the later ones - I was in fact considering putting the book down before I reached half of it, but the farther into it, the more engrossing it became). Because - surprise!- there is a plot and a connection between those stories which makes them more into a novel towards the end. Therefore, it is important to read carefully! The characters make a delightful rainbow of personalities, my favorites being James Branch and Rally (and my favorite story is "The Opals"). I like Thomas Merchant, too. Patrick and his story remind me of "The American Psycho". 

The book ends in a powerful climax and it is worth reading, although it is definitely light literature, but very good in its kind. At the beginning it needs some momentum and definitely gets better as it goes, but the colorful characters and magical atmosphere (Jonathan Carroll, obviously, must have been an inspiration!) make it really interesting. I agree, though, with the critical voices that the Creative Writing classes are obviously visible here - it seems to be a problem of most recent debuts, unfortunately. Luckily, this one does not pretend to be more than it is
