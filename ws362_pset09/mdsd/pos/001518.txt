This companion set to the book, The Inner Temple of Witchcraft is one of the most powerful I have used.  Christopher Penczak is an amazing author and when you listen to his voice on the CD's he doesn't lull you to sleep nore does his voice rake across your nerves.  He gently takes you into a complete state of guided meditation and helps you to explore your own potential as a witch.  I highly recommend every one of his books and CD sets as you will never regret owning them.  They are both useful for beginners who have never performed meditation before and great for those who need a little guidance to get deep enough
