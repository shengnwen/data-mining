I enjoy reading this book to my two year old son.  The illustrations are lovely, and my son enjoys picking out the different trains and train friends in the pictures.  However, the stories themselves, like the Thomas videos, at times, contain sassy and rude language for younger children, words such as "stupid."  Overall, I recommend the purchase of this book given the number of stories included in the text and the beautiful illustrations, but buyer beware: the textual language is not totally appropriate for children under three.
