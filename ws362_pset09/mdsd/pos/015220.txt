Great book but for Dumas standard it could be better. The 4 preceeding books  starting wtih The Three Musketeers , Twenty Years After, The Vicomte De Bragelonne and  Louise De LA Valliere are by far more carefully written. It seems that Dumas wanted to hurriedly end  the saga.   Could be better and the story can be extended a little more...  Pointing blame to La Valliere and abrupt end to Aramis' actions are  too roughly plotted
