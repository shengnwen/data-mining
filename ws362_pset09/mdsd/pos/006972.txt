"The Miernik Dossier," Charles McCarry's debut novel, is absolutely brilliant.  The book is written in the form of a series of reports from field agents concerning a Polish national who may or may not be a spy.  The story is very cerebral and complex with excellent character development and wonderful descriptions of Cold War Europe.  The humor underlying many of the agents' reports adds to the brilliance of the book.  There are very few contemporary spy novels, or books in general, which come close to the excellence of "The Miernik Dossier"
