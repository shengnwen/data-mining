I found 'Boys and Girls Learn Differently" to be a useful and fascinating introduction to the general strengths and weaknesses of males and females in the classroom.

Some reviewers may laugh or poke fun at the relatively old ideas that he is presenting as new in the areas of male/female brain differences. These may be old ideas in the biology lab, but someone needs to walk over to the schools of education across the country because the 'tabla rasa' theory (the mind is a blank slate and gender differences are entirely a product of culture, not nature) is alive and still kicking hard.

The only complaint I have is that Gurian refers a lot to seminars and ongoing experiments in school designs that will be helpful in teaching to the strengths and weaknesses of girls and boys. However, he comes up a bit short in providing concrete examples of how to help both boys and girls.
