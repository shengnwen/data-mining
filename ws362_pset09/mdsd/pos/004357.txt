I recently picked up a copy of the first book in the War of Souls series because a friend brought it into work in a box of other books.  I began to read it and realized I really had to have the original books in this series.  So I put it away and bought the first book in the Dragonlance Chronicles.  I am completely hooked on this series now.  These have got to be the best Fantasy novels I have read in a very long time.  They have action, adventure, humor, romance, horror... everything you can ask for in a fantasy novel.  I would give these way over a 10 if I could but I have to settle for 5 stars.  I have no idea how I missed these books over the years they are fantastic... :
