I was first given this book by my bio-identical howmone replacement health provider; I loved it! It is a comprehensive resource for anyone who has been diagnosed with hormone imbalances; post-menopausal or post-hysterectomy patients can improve their lives vastly by using James Wilson's recommendations. I have. It is fun and easy to read, much like a "Adrenal Fatigue For Idiots". The questionnaire is easily worth the price of admission.
On a cautionary note, however, I believe that medical tests (saliva/blood tests) for hormone imbalance should be conducted for anyone who believes that there may be a problem with hormone production.  Self-diagnosing is never a good idea, as many of the symptoms of adrenal fatigue can also be signs of far more serious, even life-threatening illnesses.  The author of this book does warn against self-diagnosis several times, but some individuals may ignore this advice to their (possible) detriment. By all means read this book, use this book, but use it as a companion with medical recommendations. Saliva test kits can be obtained from any women's health professional or endocrinologist, and the tests are inexpensive.
