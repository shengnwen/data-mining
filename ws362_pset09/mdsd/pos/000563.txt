In Manufacturing Consent, Hermann and Chomsky present a very powerful institutional analysis of the media.  The authors put forth a "propaganda model" which outlines various ways in which the media filter information to serve the interest of the powerful elites.  Although the propaganda model makes sense from a logical and theoretical standpoint (given the economic constraints faced in the news industry), the real power of the book are case studies that provide near bullet-proof support for the model.  In fact, the model is introduced in the first chapter, while the remainder of the book is a series of case studies.  Even the most skeptical reader (as I was) will be pretty hard pressed to poke holes in the model after the gauntlet of case studies it is put through.  Because this book tells us so much about the objectivity of the news we receive from the agenda setting news sources, I honestly believe that Manufacturing Consent is one of the most important books ever written.

I think an enterprising young graduate student may have an interesting research topic should they decide to write a paper that applies the propaganda model to the treatment of slavery by the media in the mid 1800's, or perhaps the media's treatment of animals today.
