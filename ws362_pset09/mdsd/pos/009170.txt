I just started reading this today. 

It is hard for a non-MBA to review the book, being that my only understanding of what goes on in MBA halls is based on my friend's stories and the plethora of business books I've read.

However, I can say that the book covers most of the topics being discussed in classrooms today.

What I find most convinient is the ease with which the authors handle the business language. Furthermore, the book is tightly organized, starting out with a basic review of macro/micro economics.

I think even someone just looking for a basic understanding of business and economic phenomena will take away a lot from this book
