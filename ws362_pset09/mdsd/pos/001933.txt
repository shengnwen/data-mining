This is definitely a good read.  It is a little sad, but very intriguing.  I like the way it was written.  It was not a scary book, a little creepy at times, but you can definitely turn the lights out after reading this one.  It focuses more on seeking the cause behind the haunting.  I really liked the family in the book as well, you did not get the impression that they were dysfunctional and seeking attention.  I would recommend this one.
