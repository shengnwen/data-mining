though it is not the epitome of the series, nor is it the best novel in the series, the big fat kill is a prime example of Frank miller's art style and skill for writting. He stays true to the first two books, and gives us a wonderfull look at the characters who are soon to become key people in further chapters. All in all the book is worth adding to your collection of sin city novels
