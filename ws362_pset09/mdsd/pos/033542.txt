The book is about going digital and not just adding more computers or going on-line but creating a whole digital business design for your company. It takes a look at how several business in different areas have gone digital and at different stages in the digital design of several business. I like that it doesn't preach that everything will work for everybody the same way and it stresses creating a good basic business design as the foundation for creating a good digital design. It sparks ideas and guidelines more than a cookbook approach. Good for the large IBM's to the storefront from dot.coms to mom and pops
