Charles Bukowski had a rare gift.  He could make desperation beautiful.  He could make hate and pain beautiful.  Bukowski had a magic way of twisting emotions into poems of unimaginable shapes.  Each poetic flash serving as a portal into one man's interpretation of life.  And that, I think, impresses me most about Bukowski.  There is no pretension.  His work... simply is.  Mocking Bird came out in 1979 and some readers commented that B. was going soft.  What they fail to realize is that people evolve.  Bukowski was still Bukowski, but perhaps his poet eyes began to see some different shades of gray.  And we certainly can't fault him for that.
