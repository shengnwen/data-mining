The title refers to the members of an underground Native American Church peyote cult whose totem is the mole, &quot;the predator of the nadir.&quot; The mystery involves the attempted murder of a dying man, the disappearance  of his corpse from the hospital morgue, a uranium mine, a fatal oil-well  explosion 30 years earlier, and the theft of a keepsake box filled mostly  with black rocks. This novel has the distinction of featuring the scariest,  most chilling villain of the series: an emotionless, psychopathic,  methodical killer for hire who leaves nothing to chance. The suspense  builds as the point of view alternates between the killer's and Navajo  policeman Jim Chee's. &quot;People of Darkness&quot; is one of the best in  a literate and very entertaining Southwestern series. For other  well-written American Indian-related mysteries, try James D. Doss' Shaman  series and Margaret Coel's Arapaho series
