When I was little, this book sat on my bookshelf for I don't know how long. It was too long, too natural-sy looking and seemed too boring for me to read for a long time. When I did read it, it became part of me but I could never guess at how important it would become to me until some twenty years later.

A couple of years ago I decided to write an honours thesis in my chosen area of English Literature. And what was the most valuable book I'd ever read and that was more worthy of academic study than any other? A Girl of the Limberlost. It is the flagship book for my studies in American nature writing. Although  I'm currently journeying through all the big guns - Thoreau. Whitman, Abbey etc., none as yet hold a candle to the Limberlost, an intriguing mix of swampland and some of the tallest timber in the United States. Admittedly, the plot is trite, the ending disappointing, the characters slightly unbelievable, but there is something that lifts this book above its own flaws and I really think that's the nature writing sequences. And the way people are incorporated into that nature.

It's also the deeply rooted sense of Americana in the story. From the descriptions of food and clothes to the long, unsealed roads, I think this book is the best introduction for young female readers into American ethics, style and enterprise in the early twentieth-century. It certainly gave me, an Australian, a taste of Americana which has proved more useful and comforting than I could have ever imagined. I recommend it without reserve for any reader, but particularly young girls. I just wish I could remember who gave it to me. I'd love to say thanks
