Honestly, this is a must have as far as I am concerned. It is a small book, but it is full of essential information that can help parents and professionals understand how to help individuals with Asperger Syndrome reach their potential. I have recommended this book to many parents and professionals in my work as an educational specialist and find it helpful when working as a member of an IEP team. Busy professionals and parents who advocate for children with Asperger Syndrome will find themselves referring to this book again and again.
