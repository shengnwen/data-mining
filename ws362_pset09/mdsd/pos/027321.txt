I liked this book and found it hard to put down. I appreciated how honest Wickwire was in telling about his obsession with climbing. He didn't get defensive in retrospect and pin the blame on others when things went wrong on the climb. He openly admitted his mistakes and weaknesses, as well as his strengths. I think he realizes his self-absorption and even selfishness in undertaking such risks. 

Although some will disagree, I thought the fact that he openly wrote about his feelings for fellow climber Marty Hoey was refreshing. I don't think that many climbers who become engaged in a "romantic entanglement" while on an expedition would have the guts to tell about it. Who knows though, perhaps he wouldn't have written about his relationship with Marty had she lived.

Although the guy is selfish and egotistical at times, I still came away liking him. He's human with weaknesses like the rest of us.

I only gave this book 4 stars because it's not the best mountaineering book I've read, but I do highly recommend it as one of my favorites
