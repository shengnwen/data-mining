I'm not a big baseball fan these days, but I wanted to read this book and I'm glad I did. Maraniss tells the story of Clemente, warts and all, showing the reader the good man without nominating him for sainthood. He also outlines the events leading up to the plane crash that killed Clemente and 4 others; it's difficult to read that section of the book without a touch of anger. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it
