What a whimisical tale!!
I throughly enjoyed Tony Hawks writing style.
His easy-going approach to writing about his journey through Ireland was written on such a personal level, it made me want to visit the folks he met, while on my journey through Ireland as well!
His insight into the human psyche (esp. the Irish kind!) was right on the money!
How making something out of something that's not (his size of his fridge for example!), the huge involvement by everyone around, just goes to show the great and loving sense of humour the Irish have. Great 'craic', no?! 
It was somewhat daunting to hear of all the partying, everywhere, all the time, but his fall-down-drunk-and-get-up-and-do-it-again tales were comical. 
I also thought he was cute! By the time I got to his photo, I wanted to meet him too!
Great Easy Read!
Take it on the plane over to Ireland, leave it for the next Traveler to read!!
