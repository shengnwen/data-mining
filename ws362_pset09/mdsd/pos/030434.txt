I liked this book. It's very well written, and although the author doesn't want us to see her as a woman, her dessciptions and tale are clearly from a woman's perspective. She keeps an upper hand on her male deckhands and is reluctant to step into the middle of a fight. I found it interesting that there's so much superstition that Greenlaw says goes along with fishing. You'd think such a tough bunch wouldn't be wary of anything. Made me think often of Deadliest Catch on TV, although I'd much prefer a book
