You have to think about love, murder, sex, incest, and self-relinquish.  This is not what one might call the typical lifestyle.  This is an overall excellant book.  Somehow Sophicle's created a story of sex, love, murder,  incest, and guilt.  One might call it a fight for self awareness.  You   must admit, after reading this novel you feel a little remorse for the main  charcter, Odeipus.  I mean, anyone who falls in love with his own mother  and kills his father sub-consciously needs pitty.  I would recommend anyone  to read this book
