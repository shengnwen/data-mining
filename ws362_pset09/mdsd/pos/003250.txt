Mark Clodfelter's "The Limits of Air Power" is an interesting book that explains the development and deployment of strategic air power during the Vietnam War.  The book is based on excellent research and provides a good overview of all of the political and military nuances that guided the application of strategic bombing above the 20th parallel.

Clodfelter falls short in his conclusion that the war as fought by the communists was primarily a guerilla war prior to TET 1968, and that strategic air power would not have provided the same results in 1965-66 as did Operations Linebacker I and II during 1972.  The primary combatants until 1968 were the Viet Cong but they were supplied with arms and material by the North Vietnamese.  Although they did not require food from NVN for their subsistence, they sure needed arms and ammo.  Surprisingly, Clodfelter overlooks this obvious point.

I believe the application of an intense strategic bombing campaign in 1965-66 -- as conducted during Linebacker II might have produced the results that were achieved during December 1972.  Instead of being so certain about his conclusion -- maybe he should simply let the reader decide
