I bought this product when my son was only 3 months old.  Unfortunately, it wasn't until I opened the product that I learned that they recommend you starting at 7 months.  I wish that would have been clear before I bought it.  So I haven't started to use it yet...so I don't have any thoughts on the actual product...YET.  ;-
