Jim Willard spends a final weekend with his friend Bob Ford at a cabin before Bob heads off to sea, like they talked abouts.  They're very close friends, and during this weekend of horseplay and relaxation, Jim and Bob take it to the next level.  Before they leave the cabin, Jim promises to hook up with Bob once he's graduated.  A year later, and with the memory of that weekend at the cabin still floating through his mind, Jim sets off to find the elusive love of his llfe, going to see, becoming ensnared in the glitz of Hollywood, traveling to South America, but clinging to his love for Bob and never letting himself fall completely for any other men.

This novel beautifully tells the story of a young man's search for the ideal person -- or who he thinks is the ideal -- one who is in tune with him in every way.  The characters are all well-written, and you really feel that you are right alongside Jim as he makes his way through the world.

In the introduction, Vidal talks about how he re-wrote the entire book after its initial publication due to public reaction to the original, tragic ending.  The re-written ending, I feel, is much stronger and shows what happens when the ideal becomes tarnished in the idolizer's eyes. It's a remarkable book that discusses homosexuality in a very open way for a novel from 1945.  A thoroughly enjoyable read
