Susan Elizabeth Phillips has a great talent for combining beautifully human characters and incredibly funny situations to produce feel-good stories.  Match Me If You Can is no exception.  I found myself laughing out loud in parts, so be careful if you don't want strange looks when reading this book in public.  I always look forward to Phillips' new publications and she never disappoints.
