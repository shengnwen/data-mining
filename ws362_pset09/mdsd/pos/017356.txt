I think one of the greatest parts of this book is that Bok did not just state her ideas and opinions on the issues being discussed. If you think you are pretty honest person, read this book and see just how honest you really are.  After reading this book, I thought a whole lot about my own actions.  I realized just how many times in my life I am not completely honest.  I am a college student and in the week I was reading this book, I had two roommates ask me to lie for them.  The first one asked me to tell someone on the phone who was not there.  The guy was an ex-boyfriend who just didn't get the point that she didn't want to talk to him, so I justified that I was helping out my friend by lying for her.  Before I read this book, I probably wouldn't have felt that bad lying to guy, but this book made me rethink what I was doing.  In the other instance, one of my other roommates asked me to pretend to be her mom so she could change her cell phone plan.  Her mother knew she was chaning to plan, so I justified it by thinking that, but it was hard when the person on the other end asked me if I really was who I claimed to be.  

My advice is that if you don't want to know how dishonest or unethical you are in your life, don't read this book, but if you want to see where you are going wrong or you think you are really ethical, read this book to see just how ethical and honest you are in your life.  I think you will be amazed at the results.

Another thing I can say about this book is that I am currently in a media ethics and mroal reasoning class, and I have read a few books in this class, but I personally think this is the best one I have read in the class.
