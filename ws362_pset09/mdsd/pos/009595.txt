In reading this one might wonder if the United States and perhaps the whole world is vastly polluted beyond public pronouncement. Was the premise of the "Lost in Space" television series ahead of its time in denoting a dying planet?

A reader might also question what any employee and specifically a person in an environmental,health and safety role might do if confronted with a company dumping knowingly harmful chemicals in the backlot. If such an employee went to OSHA or EPA for example, would such agencies protect them and would they be able to get employment as a result of trying to stop it? Don't goverment officials often have to pursue a private career and could a conflict of interest ensue if they are put in a position to enforce against prospective employers? And if former high level government officials are serving on the Boards of such companies, what retaliation might occur if an employee takes action after all internal efforts have failed?

Perhaps the most important aspect of this case is that it shows a group of families, following suit of those previously led by attorney Michael Gatta, trying to establish what happened,why and who was responsible
