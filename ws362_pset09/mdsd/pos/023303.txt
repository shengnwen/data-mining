Last year's &quot;Best American Travel Writing&quot; was a very, very satisfying collection; I have read it twice, have placed it on my &quot;permanent&quot; bookshelf, and constantly recommend it to friends who are ardent nonfiction readers and/or travelers. This 2001 volume is enjoyable but not as well balanced. The 2000 edition had its share of serious and sometimes even searing and terrifying articles, but those entries were leavened by a few sidesplittingly funny ones. Since my favorite travel experiences have been guffaw-worthy (usually at my expense), I appreciated the inclusion of the humor. I'm a HUGE fan of Paul Theroux's fiction (especially &quot;My Secret History&quot; and &quot;My Other Life,&quot; and some of his short stories and novellas), but not his travel books; while I would love to sit down with Paul and talk for hours about books, the idea of traveling with him is about as appealing as spending a week on the road with my aged and increasingly whiney Aunt Sally. So perhaps that explains my respect for but RELATIVE lack of enthusiasm for this collection. Taken separately, each article is compelling; but put together, this is a somewhat somber collection. Having said that, I must urge you to buy this book--each entry is worthy of a careful reading and will expand your knowledge of the world
