Dan Slott is one of the most underrated writers in mainstream comics today.  Perhaps best known for his run on the surprisingly good She-Hulk, Slott does Marvel's version of Formerly Known as the Justice League with G.L.A.: Misassembled; a mini-series taking place during the disassembling of the Avengers.  A bunch of D-league superheroes (maybe even lower), known as the Great Lakes Avengers tries to become the real deal with the real Avengers gone, but as they soon find out, that's easier said than done.  Especially when an old Avengers villain comes out of the woodwork with a plan that could destroy, well, everything.  What really makes G.L.A. so good is Slott's hilarious dialogue and story that not only pokes fun at the superhero genre, but comic books in general.  Not to mention the not so subtle jab at Brad Meltzer's Identity Crisis mini-series for DC; G.L.A. features many memorably inefficient heroes (including leader Mr. Immortal, as well as an obese, bulemic heroine by night and supermodel by day).  What G.L.A. really does the best though is remind us in this doom and gloom age of comics is that they can still do the one thing they were meant to do in the first place: be a fun escape.  Paul Pelletier (Exiles) provides solid art to boot.  The only real downside is that G.L.A. is short, too short.  That aside, there's some extra issues thrown in here, including John Byrne's issue of West Coast Avengers which introduces the heroes featured here.  All in all, though it doesn't get a 5-star rating, G.L.A. is still worth picking up, and is one of the more fun comics to come out in quite some time
