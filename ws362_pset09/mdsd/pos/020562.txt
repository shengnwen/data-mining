The book includes explanations of why the photographer went with the approach they did (including the dead-honest "I only had five minutes to set up" in a couple cases).  It shows diagram layouts of what lights were used at what angles, which is excellent for learning what the basic layouts are, and giving you a leg up if you want to shoot a portrait and are thinking about how to approach it.  

And best of all, it's not all HIS photographs.  Most books suffer badly under the weight of a single photographer trying to demonstrate something.  By definition, every photographer has a style, and in any "one photographer" book you're going to get a ton about shooting in THEIR style, but almost no diversity of approaches abd styles.  That diversity is important in learning the principles that let you develop YOUR OWN style.  That's great for booksellers, since you probably have to digest 10-15 books to get enough range to have a sense of what's possible.  (Assuming there are 10-15 books that are good - and my bookshelf suggests there aren't.)

As to "not useful for social photography portraits" - if you're looking to shoot school portraits, or families in front of the same backdrops, that's probably true.  But if you're looking to do creative portraits with some sizzle and style and snap to them, this book has many examples that you could go duplicate right away.  And it'll give you the raw material ideas to come up with 20 other approaches.

The best of the 10 "lighting for..." books on my shelf - more content than all the other 9 put together
