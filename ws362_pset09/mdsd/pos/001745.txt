Book #23 in the In Death Series.
This book had the potential to be the best in the series.  But Eve's ever increasing sensitivity issues made ruined it's perfection.
As the Swisher family is brutally murdered in their sleep, their is a lone survivor and witness, their young daughter Nixie.
In the beginning Eve embraces the child reluctantly when she finds her in the home hiding.  You feel Eve can relate to her terror.  Then when Eve brings the child into her home to protect her, she does everything she can to alienate the kid.  COME ON!  I thought Eve was growing and then she takes a giant leap back.  It was just a little to over the top for me.  Too much lack of compassion.  Thank goodness for Raorke and Sommerset.  The mystery is top notch, and Peabody is back on the job.  
I just wish Eve would take some sensitivity classes.  Other than that another excellent book.
