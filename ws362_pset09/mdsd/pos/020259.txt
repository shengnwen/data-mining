I would like to thank Mr. Venturi for letting us into his very personal life, I found the book to be a down to earth and hart warming. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It made laugh and made me cry. I also found it very informative on the game, written in a way that I could understand it. I can't imagine anyone not liking this book... except maybe someone who purposely tried to hurt Mr. Venturi. I give it a two thumbs up
