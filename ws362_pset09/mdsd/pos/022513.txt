First of all let me state unequivically, I love Architectual Digest, and this book is a dream for those of us who do.  The houses vary, some are opulent, some are modest, most are in between.  You get a feel for the real person behind the star fascade and because Architectural Digest has been in circulation for so long, some of old guard Hollywood is on display here as well as the more current stars.  It's interesting to see the juxisposition of the era's.  Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in this subject
