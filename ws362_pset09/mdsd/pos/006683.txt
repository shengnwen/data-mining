I greatly admire Fairchild's poetry, but I only came across him recently when I read "Old Men Playing Basketball" (from _The Art of the Lathe_) in Billy Collins's anthology _Poetry 180_.  After buying _The Art of the Lathe_, I became a convert to Fairchild's midwestern, blue-collar ethos, strained through one of the most finely balanced poetic lenses I have encountered in a long time.  I went on to buy other works, and my admiration has only increased.  I can find out very little about Fairchild, however.  He seems to have started his poetic career late; at least  the one photo I have seen of him shows him as an older man. 

Fairchild's poetry is reminiscent at some times of Whitman, at others of James Wright, about whom he has written poems. Fairchild is an accessible poet, not one of those who are so anxious to "make it new" that they fall into obscurities that make their poetry more frustrating than enriching. Any work by Fairchild is worth looking into.
