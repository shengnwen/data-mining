My nephew saw this book on Reading Rainbow a decade ago and asked his mom to buy it for me because it reminded him of me (single, in my early 20s, enjoying my life).  The story is fun and the illustrations are fabulous.  Read it with your kids in the tongue-in-cheek manner in which it's presented. It's a children's book and as long as you continue to expose your kids to all kinds of other books, I don't think you need to be concerned about them "internalizing" the message here.  Or, better yet, here are messages you can instill: For girls, if you say you don't want to get married, then it's not nice to tell boys that if they do as you command you'll marry them and then pull a dirty trick on the one who actually does everything you say; For boys, if you want to get married and a girl says she doesn't then you should find another girl who shares your views of marriage
