As usual this is another great book by Nevada Barr

Anna gets herself into trouble at least twice but comes out of it brused and bleeding as usual. 

great story & things are starting to look up for her. 

Nevada Barr in  one of the best writers out there. Edge of the seat story lines. 

I have every book she has ever written.
