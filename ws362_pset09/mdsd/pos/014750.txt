Just returned from &quot;Paradise&quot; (Maui)and had a chance to visit the wonderful &quot;Hali'imaile General Store&quot; restaurant-what a experience!! Outstanding meal (didn't get a chance to sample the 'crab dip'-and unfortunately, it's not in the cookbook),amazing artwork, unbelievable floral arrangements and excellent service!!I just had to buy the cookbook and I'm so glad I did-the same wonderful foods, artwork and floral arrangements are in the cookbook-wait until you see the pictures-breathtaking!! It's more than a cookbook (with some wonderful receipes)it's a picture book to enjoy!
