I had the pleasure of meeting Gessner at a bookstore he made an appearance at.  I bought two of his books, &quot;Wild Rank..&quot; and &quot;Return of the Osprey.&quot;  I was almost unable to put down &quot;Wild Rank.&quot;  It was so moving...so touching...so brilliantly honest, I kept the pages open as I did mundane things so I could peek over occassionally and be mesmerized by his essay.  The book is a mix of so many things -- there's a little &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; in his brutal honesty.  Then there's a little Thoreau when he briefs us on what the marshes and the &quot;Suet&quot; mean to him.  This book is a must read for anyone who understands or wants to understand that life on life's terms is the only way we can exist -- and one of life's terms is that we take care of the land.  Another of those terms is that our parents, for whatever faults they have, shape us in ways we can neither forget nor sometimes identify.  David, I'm so glad I met you -- the book has been one of those wonderful surprises in life that change you a little bit when you encounter them.  Kudos
