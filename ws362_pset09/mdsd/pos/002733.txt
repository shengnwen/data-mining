Wow!  I recently purchased this fine book based on the other Amazon reviews.  They are not wrong!  I had never heard of My Father's Dragon, even though it has apparently been in print for 50 years.  All I can say is that bedtime has become adventure-time for my 4-year old.  We have GREATLY enjoyed reading these stories over the last week or so.  We read about 4 chapters every night.  Whenever we get to a new chapter he starts excitedly asking "Can we do it?  Can we do it?  Pleeeeeeeease!".

We will be re-reading this book over and over... I can already tell.  This was a fantastic find!  Avoid chapter books like "Captain Underpants" and "Geronimo Stilton"... they are trash in comparison to MFD
