Back 25 or so years ago when I bought this book, it was among the first Star Trek books I ever got.  Perhaps the first one.  As an adaptation of the original Star Trek episodes &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow is Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot;, &quot;Court Martial&quot;, &quot;Operation - Annihilate!&quot;, &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, and &quot;Space Seed&quot;, it contains some of the most powerful Star Trek stories.  Blish did a good job of adaptation.  I must've read this and the rest of the series umpty zillion times before switching to something else.  I ended up getting all twelve books plus &quot;Mudd's Women&quot;.  Good stuff
