This is a story about a girl who is not beautiful on her outside, but is beautiful on her inside. The story takes place on the shores of Lake Ontario. She and her hard-hearted sisters are three of many women who want to marry an invisible being. But only someone who can see him, can marry him. The lesson is on the importance of having a good heart more than beautiful clothes or looks. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Native American culture and people who need to learn the importance of having a good heart
