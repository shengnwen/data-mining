This 1998 Brad Meltzer thriller although not in the same masterpiece league as The Zero Game and The First Council is still a great read.  It is not as fast paced a read as those novels but an enjoyable thriller non the less. 

Jared is a successful defence attorney but needs to attract new clients to the firm before he can become a partner.  Sara is unemployed but equally talented and finally lands her dream job as a district attorney but on her first day learns that mass layoffs will occur shortly and its highly likely since she is brand new she will be one of the ones to go.  She decides to steal a case because it was requested to one of the most popular district attorney's and she figures it has to be huge and she can show her stuff then won't be fired.  She's disappointed to learn it is just a burglary case prosecuting some low life called Kozlow and now everyone knows she stole it.  Still she must win it to have any chance of not being fired.

Kozlow becomes Jared's client and when he later finds out it's his wife's case tries to pull out.  Kozlow takes Jared to a man named Rafferty who explains they obviously didn't hire Jared for his skill but because he is the husband of the DA.  They also tell him if he doesn't win Sara will be killed and if he tells her they both will.  He has no choice but to defeat his wife who not only is motivated to win to keep her career but also threatened Jared will be killed if she doesn't.
