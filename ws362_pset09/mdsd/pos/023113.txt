Several high-speed instructors I train with have spoken of Paul Howe as one of the finest tactical trainers in the United States.  When I heard he had written a book, I was anxious to read it and I wasn't disappointed. If you are a police officer or in the military, you MUST read this book! Also required reading for anyone interested in self defense or a glimpse into the mindset of the kind of men this country needs to win the war on terrorism.
Paul gives examples of real situations he was involved in and then goes into "lessons learned" and objectives to strive for.  Written in a straightforward style, it conveys its' points better than any other book on this subject that I've read.  Highly recommended!
