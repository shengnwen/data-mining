Although there may be complainants about Dr. Williams not addressing certain forms of slavery throughout history it has to be kept in mind that his thesis was about the hows and whys of African enslavement in the Caribbean.  Williams firmly argues and details how today's culture of racism and capitalism was born. 
This book is extremely well done and a great beginner for anyone interested in the topic of Caribbean history.
