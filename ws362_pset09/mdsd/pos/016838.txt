First the good: This is a well-written, excellently illustrated work. The techniques are well explained and the photos really bring home the author's intent. It is easy to read, follow, and understand. Clearly no book, no matter how well written, is a substitute for competent hands-on training but this will make a great handbook for practitioners to refer back to. Krav Maga evolved from a soldier's art rather than from a civilian's as many traditional karate or kung fu methods. The techniques are straightforward and relatively easy to learn. Many are very practical.

Now the bad: I'm really, really leery of some of what is taught herein. For example, on page 34 a kick to the chin is shown in defense of a straight knife thrust. Sorry folks, but that's an almost certain recipe for disaster. First off, unless you are a superior, lightning fast athlete there is no way you can kick that high without eating steel since the attacker's wrist only has to move a few inches to slice or stab your leg, foot, or ankle while you need to cover several feet to hit his/her chin. Even worse if your timing is off you could be hit in an even more vital area. In 30 years of martial arts I've met and trained hundreds upon hundreds of practitioners. I know perhaps one or two who could pull this off. Perhaps there is some hidden intent that I don't understand or something got lost in translation from Hebrew but I'm just not buying this one...

Overall: Don't get me wrong, there really is a lot of good stuff in here. However, there are techniques you know, techniques you do, techniques you train, and techniques you'd stake your life on. Choose wisely!
