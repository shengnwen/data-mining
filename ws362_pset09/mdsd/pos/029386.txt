This wonderful book about relying on your senses when you are blind demonstrates that blind people can lead a productive life.  Grandpa shares his zest for life with his grandson, John.  At first John does not  understand how his grandpa is able to do all that he does.  Grandpa shares  his secret.  As a preservice teacher I've used this book to talk about  aging and its effects with my students.  We also talk about what we can do  to help others who have disabilities.  This is an excellent book to allow  children to examine their thoughts on older people and disabilities
