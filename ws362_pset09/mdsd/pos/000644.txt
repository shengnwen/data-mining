A good read for coaches but...
There are so few good life lessons out there for young female athletes trying to establish themselves in the world that when one comes along it is best that the gals can access it.  
This book's title portends portentously and so it is likely that most of those who will read it will be coaches, educators and maybe a few parents.  
That is the big problem with this book's title.  
Kathy's lessons are more valuable than that!  
This book should be read by female athletes!  ...those female athletes who are trying to establish themselves as athletes and people in our world.  
& then if the role models, educators and care givers want to talk it over with their young ladies, so be it.
