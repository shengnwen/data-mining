This is a critically acclaimed collection of short stories from a writer many people put near the top of the list of great living writers. It starts off with three Viet Nam stories, then eight other stories. Many of the characters and themes repeat-Viet Nam vets,  boxers, epilepsy, philosophy. The stories are raw and the characters are intense, violent, very flawed heroes. Online, the majority of the criticism about the stories is that they exude a stereotypical machismo. I thought the opposite. I thought the machismo was very unstereotypical. I can't think of anyone I've read about who would break your face and then contemplate Schopenhauer. There was one story, about a woman dying, that I thought was a bit melo-dramatic, but most of the stories were quick, hard-hitting, and insightful.
