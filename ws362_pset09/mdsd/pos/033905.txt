David Suchet is one of the best narrators that I have heard. He give each of the characters their own "voice" and manages to include the nuances and intonations as well. He did not just read the story he "became" the charaters. The packaging was very good with the cds being held together in a sturdy plastic case - which will be good protection over time.
