I studied this book with the author.  It is a masterful work written with intense passion and desire to unearth the real drives behind modern consumer culture.  Anyone who picks it up will, no doubt, look at the little things in his/her life much differently afterwords.  Don't get me wrong, the book is to the extreem left, but the ideals of the left are often true and we are so taken in by the consumer culture that we do not wish to admit them.  If anyone feels as though they are living in a daze, giving in to the false demands the culutre puts upon them,, this book will give hope that these things were created and forged by men.  Read this with an open mind and a critical eye upon your own life
