Jerry Cook puts into words my hearts cry!
He reminds me to hope and dream of what the Body of Christ could be.
I love this book so intensely it's looking rather worn.
After reading it over and over myself, I bought copies for my board and staff.
I even preached a sermon series inspired from its pages and encouraged my entire church to purchase and devour it!
If the people of God knew how to really love, accept and forgive, we would truly be Jesus with skin on.

PS...thank you Jerry Cook and Stanley C. Baldwin for letting the Holy Spirit use you to positively change THE church..
