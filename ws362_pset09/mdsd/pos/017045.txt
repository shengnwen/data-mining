I went in to reading this manga knowing it was confusing but even though I tried to be aware and pay attention closley... certain parts of this manga baffled me to the point of utter frustration but more on that later. First and Foremost for me is the art. It caught my eye like no other manga artwork before had. It's crude almost scribble-esque look is like nothing else and really fits with the chaotic nature of the manga. Second is the creativity of the plot. While the creativity sometimes borders on insanity, I could find no manga cliches here and that is a rare feat.  Like I've said before the plot is confusing. I read this volume multiple times along with volume two and I was still pretty confused. I know it's too deep or whatever but it's just plain incoherent at somne parts which really frustrated me thus I give it a four rather than a five
