What's the best part about the book ? Quite clearly in bold capital letters , its the ATMOSPHERE. Spain at crossroads , barely holding on to its vast empire , with decadence and religious persecution spread all around- ravishing fare. Captain Alacriste is not so much a Zorro , rather more human with many flaws. Reconciled with the may failings of a brutal society , he carries out the role of a hired sword to perfection , with some streaks of strong character and a heart of gold. 
	The novel has multiple perspectives - the protagonist is an apprentice to the Captain who eventually plays a fairly important role in the chain of events. The plot is intricate , with the assignment that the Captain takes up hiding layers and layers of court intrigue. The title hints to the obsession in the Spanish clergy with purging the society of any Jewish influences. The protagonist lands up in prison , facing charges of breaking into an abbey - a charge punishable by death. You can almost hear the drumbeats in the background towards a violent climax. Though expectedly for a series , this does end well. 
	The real treat in the book is the snippets of history that you garner from the thoughts of the protagonist and Captain Alatriste. There is no attempt at moralising - there is evil in society , but that was the norm during the period. For a person with limited knowledge of Spanish History (me) , the book still keeps you rivetted to the end. Highly recommende
