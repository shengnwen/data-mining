Be careful, Mr. Damasio, you don't have a hold of Spinoza yet.  He does know that mind and body are of one substance, but neither is dependent on the other.  They are of two different attributes of substance, and in no way does one cause the other.  Your neuroscience is of the body and can tell us nothing about the mind.  This distinction is one of the great contributions of Spinoza and of philosophy in general
