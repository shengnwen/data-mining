As a single mother and a manager in a Technical Support department, I have quite a bit of stress in my life. I used to take it all with me at the end of the day and often ended up continuing to "work" all through the night. This has been a tremendous help in guiding me to relax at the end of the day and just let go of all the stress and worries. The more I use it, the easier it is to relax - both at the end of the day and when I find myself in stressful moments during the day. I am now trying the Indigo Dreams children's version with my kids to help them calm down and get ready to sleep. I really like the positive nature this takes in empowering the listener to direct herself.
