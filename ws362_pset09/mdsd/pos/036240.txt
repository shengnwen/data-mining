I just read this book after getting it for Christmas yesterday, and I think it's great. After getting nowhere with two doctors, a physical therapist, and conflicting information I've gathered talking to friends and acquaintances over the years, I think this book will give me the insight and exercises I need to make some progress in strengthening my knee so I can participate in activities I had to give up (dancing and biking) and can make a much more informed decision about possible surgery. All different types of knee problems are well explained. Alignment issues (including Q-angle, foot arch, femur to tibia, patella tracking, etc.) and how they can lead to certain types of injury are explained in a way I have not seen done elsewhere. Also included are what movement tests your doctor should take in diagnosing your injury (neither doctor I went to performed those simple tests!).  I wish I had been able to read this book a few years ago when my overuse dance injury occurred, but I had not found a book so specific to the knee out on the market (this book was recently published in 2003). I would recommend this book to anyone starting to experience knee pain, as well as anyone active in sports that are known to lead to knee injury; there are exercises and stretching recommended in this book to help avoid knee injury and to strengthen the knee area to possibly avoid or delay surgery. I'm very glad the doctor/author decided to write this much-needed book
