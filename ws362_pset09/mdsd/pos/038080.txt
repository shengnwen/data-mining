This is quite simply an excellent book on deck building. I have read many, and overall I think it is the best. It is probably best for those of intermediate skill level (those they call "handy" in their 3-level self-rating scale) because my guess is that people with absolutely no construction or design knowledge probably won't find enough information to really understand what the structural issues are. For example, the joist/beam/post spacing tables are rather sparse: enough information to do the calculations if you know what you're doing, but probably difficult to figure out if you don't.

However, for many of us, it's just the thing. One of my favorite parts is all the Work Smart hints scattered throughout the book. These are tips from pro builders giving ideas and information that us non-pro wouldn't know. There are even tips in there about what to do if you make a mistake in building.

The pictures are great too, better than any other deck building book I've used. This is where the book really shines. They give you step-by-step instructions with full pictures of several different decks under construction. The concrete pouring sequence alone is worth the price of the book.

Despite all the tools they list that are mentioned in a previous review, it seems pretty honest to me: for example, they tell you, under mixing your own concrete: Pros don't mix their own concrete, they get trucks to deliver it. Pretty good, considering that Home Depot sells concrete mix and all the tools required to mix it yourself!

The only major thing I can think of that it doesn't cover is composite decking materials. These are all the rage nowadays, of course, but they require some changes in design. It would be nice to have information on these changes, and hopefully future editions will have this information.

Overall, an excellent book, and well worth its price.
