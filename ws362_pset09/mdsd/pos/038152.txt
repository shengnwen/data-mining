This book contains a plethora of legitimate, audit-proof suggestions, many of which are not on the radar of most CPAs, since they are accustomed to dealing with the W2 world.
The author has a very clear - without being condescending - way of delivering the advice. She's kind of the Carl Sagan of tax experts,using humor and common sense to give the reader a series of real-life suggestions to make major changes in both your  record-keeping methods and your business attitude as an indie.
This is the very first book of its kind that I have encountered which is devoted solely to indies and our tax issues, and which honestly succeeds in addressing them in a straightforward, non-technical manner. Suggest it to every independent businessperson you know...and give it to the ones you really love
