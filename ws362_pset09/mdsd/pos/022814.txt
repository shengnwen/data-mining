I felt that, in fairness, I should give this book four stars, because it could be just the ticket for those who are comfortable with using esoteric symbology such as pentagrams and Egyptian crocodile gods.  After all, Jung himself noted the vast amount of symbolism we humans rely on to process reality. Each to his own, then! All the same, this is not a book for readers who, like myself, want a more down-to-earth approach. Trouble is, the term *psychic* is open to a wide range of interpretations.

Certainly, a great deal of mainstream research on the energetics of thought (from scientific giants like William Braud PhD) has confirmed the fact that we affect each other, just by thinking. But this research has not as yet been translated into practical application in everyday life. At least, not by authors like Judy Hall.

If you are interested in the idea of other-world influences, this book could be very useful.  However, if you are simply concerned about human influences in this present world, which surely we encounter far more frequently, this book may not be helpful. I must say I have gleaned a few good ideas from this book, and find that it is possible to develop your own strategies from it if you are willing to be creative
