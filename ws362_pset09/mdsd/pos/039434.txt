I was loaned this book when I was pregnant with our first child and since then have bought it for every person I knew who was pregnant. Other pregnancy books sugarcoat this like "your might feel a little discomfort this month" where Armin Brott's book said: your wife will feel terrible this month. I liked that approach much more than the happy bunnies pregnancy-is-wonderful side. I would reccomend this book to everyone who is pregnant, moms and dad
