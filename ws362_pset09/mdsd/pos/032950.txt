I purchased this book after first reading "The No-Cry Sleep Solution"  by Elizabeth Pantley and "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child" by Dr. Marc Weissbluth.  The no cry book was completely useless.  I hated to hear my 4 month old cry and always carried him about, but I was so exhausted from his night wakings that I needed a real solution.  Dr. Weissbluth's book had some good information but I found the structure a bit disorganized and it was not as helpful as Dr. Ferber's book.  "Solve your Child's Sleep Problems" clearly states how important it is for a child to learn how to fall asleep alone in order to attain good quality, consolidated (non-fragmented) sleep.  My son was waking 5-6 times a night screaming out until his pacifier was replaced.  1-2 times at night I would nurse him when he wouldn't fall back asleep immediately.  So neither he nor I ever got more than 2-3 hours consolidated sleep.  This book gave me the courage to take away my son's pacifier and comfort him briefly every 10 minutes until he fell asleep without it, alone.  I hated to hear him cry but I knew we had to do it for his sleep as well as mine.  By checking on him every 10 minutes he knew I was there for him.  He cried about an hour and finally fell asleep on his own in-between  my visits.  It was the hardest thing I had ever done and in hindsight one of the best things I've done for him.  In about 2 days he was falling asleep on his own without any crying and he was waking up much happier (cooing).  He is now a great sleeper (sleeps 10-12 hours straight) and much more rested with quality sleep.  The book has tons of information for many other common and more sever sleep issues.  This book really was a lifesaver to me.  I am so grateful to get some sleep at night now and I feel like my Self again.
