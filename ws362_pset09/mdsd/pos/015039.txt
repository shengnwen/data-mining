I loved the humor in the book and the way it looked from a child's perspective. My daughter loved it so much that she wouldn't let me read any thing else. She memorized it within a week and then would read it outloud  to herself even though she can't read yet. I can't wait for a sequel!  I  also liked the illustrations. Bravo
