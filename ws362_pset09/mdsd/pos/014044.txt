&quot;Art as Expression&quot; caught my eye because of its different approach to writing about art.  Henry Peacock is obviously a talented and experienced teacher who is able to express his ideas and also demonstrate by illustration, to beginners like myself, the various aspects of structure, color, composition and expression. No doubt this would also be valuable to more experienced artists because of its depth of information. It is a book you would refer to often and seems to capture a void in the market.  Well worth looking at
