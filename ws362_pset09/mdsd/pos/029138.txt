I was attending a Christian writer's convention when I saw Michael Farri's book on the table. Having a five-month-old daughter at home, the title immediately grabbed me. True to its cover, this book is a must-read for every father who has daughters. 

Filled with personal insights, biblical exposition, and practical tips, What a Daughter Needs From Her Dad is a wonderful, insightful, call to fathers to raise good, solid, Christian ladies. 

Michael can talk about raising girls, becuase he has six of them! This is a book that I will keep close to me as I watch Grace grow up, hopefully putting into practice the lessons Michael Farris has given in his book. It is my goal to raise a young lady who yearns for God. 

Fathers, please do our country a favor, and buy this book
