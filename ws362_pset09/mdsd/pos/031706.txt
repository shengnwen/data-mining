'Orange Roofs, Golden Arches' is a rare gem of a book. I am fascinated with the 50's style 'googie' design, but I am also a fan of that weird 'Earthtones, brick red & orange' style which replaced it.

This book covers the history of resturaunt architecture fairly throughly, documenting chains changes and why the changes where made. This was eye opening to me, who bemoans 'Why are they always changing things?"

The ONLY negative is the ugly cover, but at this price that no big deal, just a shame because this book deserves better.

This book is nice trip down memory lane, even if you never experienced the resturaunt in question!
