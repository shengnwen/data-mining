After watching the movies so many times, over and over again, it was nice to step back and take a new look at the material in print form.  While they don't stray too far from their film counterparts, they do approach it in a way that makes it interesting, even for someone like me who knows the movies by heart.  They were never "boring" even though I knew exactly what was coming next.  

They are worth reading simply for the little changes that don't stack up with the movies such as the color of Yoda, the first chapter of A New Hope, and the first Death Star Battle.

Overall, I recommend this to people who have taken an interest in the Expanded Universe.  The little literary extras are worth revisiting these classics.  It's also nice to get all three of them in an inexpensive paperback edition with cool front cover artwork
