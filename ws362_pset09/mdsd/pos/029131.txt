I can say that by reading this book, you can see how Gardner thinks and you will (when you read the book) see how he tries to form his Gardnerian tradition . Whats great about the book is that Gardner puts himself into the book. Also another note, this book is the first time he mentions his own BOS within the book. Whats hard about the book, is the wording of &quot;old world language&quot;, so, you'll have to read it slow. If your a Gardnerian such as me, you'll enjoy every bit of it.Even though this book is out-of-print, its not that hard to find..trust me!
