This, believe it or not, is a very high-quality edition from, of all people, Crossway. A beautiful, calfskin edition with soft, luxuroius leather, and it is smyth-sewn, folks!! Thus, the Bible will last a long time. It  has 10.5 print(same as Deluxe Reference Bible), maps, centre-column references, and a concordance, plus Book Intros. The only complaint I have is that, of the two ribbon markers, the one presumably for the OT is cut about an inch-and-a-half shorter, so it barely extends past the bottom of the page. not good. But, I am sure that this one will outlats me!  It does retail for $195, so cheap it aint. Regarding the translation, it is a literal translation of the Scriptures, adapted from the RSV, so it sounds just like the RSV. It is not as literal as the NASB or NASBU, and it is not as wooden as that translation
