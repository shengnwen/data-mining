I had never really thought about this concept, putting weight loss with gaining money; they had my attention. Could this really be true? I had to know.
In this work the authors show the relationship between the two; I was  shocked that we had never seen this before and I certainly understood where they were coming from.  They give exercises to guide you through to a desired change in your life, both physically and financially. Each step is carefully detailed to help the reader and is given in an easy to understand manner, simple to follow and put into action in your life.  I have not started the program as yet, but I intend to and I believe that it will improve my life. This is one book that will hold your interest, perhaps make you shake your head at the revelation and could well turn your life around.Interesting!
