This as a facinating read.  It dispells myths and misconceptions
perpetrated by Hollywood and most histories.  It gives the reader
insight into the development and tactical employment of a weapon that has and continues to change the modern world.

As a reader well versed in military history, the chapters relating to the competitive development of the Maxim
and Gatling were truly news to me, as was the impact of the Maxim on European colonialism. The DeBeer's diamond monopoly owes its existence to the Maxim gun...as a jingle went at the time.."  whatever happens, we have got, the Maxim gun and they have not."

The author's treatment of the  evolution of tactical employment of the weapon is also very interesting and informative. Most modern non-military readers would not know what a machine gun barrage is, knowing only of it's use in direct fire mode.  The machine gun barrage is firing the weapon at a high angle such that the resulting stream of projectiles plunge at a high angle in a parabolic curve, resulting a area known as "beaten ground".  This is an area saturated by bullets that in practice is a lozenge shaped area. No aiming at individual targets is required.  This technique was used as recently as the Falklands war where a section of medium machine guns expended hundreds of thousands of rounds in support of a single assault.

 This is a must read for anyone interested 20th century military history
