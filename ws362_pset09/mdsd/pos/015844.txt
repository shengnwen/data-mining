A great read!  This book is the answer to the countless diets that I have tried.  The authors present a nurturing, compassionate compelling answer to years of an unhealthy relationship with food and my body.  The quotes along the way both inspired me and made me laugh.   This is the type of book that I will turn to again and again for support and guidance.  After reading this book I am proud to call myself a diet survivor!
