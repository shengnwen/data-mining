Cendrillon by Robert D. San Souci is a good book.It has a most exciting adventure.

In the beginning Cendrillon meets a washerwoman that is her Godmaother.  Then one day cendrillon's stepmother doesn't let her go to the ball. So her Godmother helps her get in to the ball.

I liked reading this book because there's a pikchre on each page. I also liked it because you will learn new words.
