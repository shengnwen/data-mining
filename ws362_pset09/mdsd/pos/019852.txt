I have already written a review on the entire left behind series but i think that this book in this series deserves ALOT of credit for setting the path for the second half of the series. This entire series has been one of the most enjoyable reads of my life. Whether you are a believer or not you can easily find this book to be an enjoyable read. 

This particular book is as exciting as any of the others, plain and simple, the basic premise of Assasins is the plan to assassinate Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia. The rest world and Carpathia are in the rebuilding process.  This entire series of books are that sooo darn good that you can't stop reading them. 

Over the course of these books the storyline increases quickly and progresses into a story that really makes you think and question what could happen...and if you are not a believer, it's simply a great work of fiction! 

I loved this book, it truely set the ground work for what was to come in the next few books....
