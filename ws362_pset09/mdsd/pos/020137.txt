I'm grateful to Anthony Bourdain for visiting places I will never go and tasting things I wouldn't dare to try. His descriptions of BAD food experiences are particularly entertaining. Bourdain immerses himself in surroundings ranging from tranquil to horrifying, but the constants are the empathy and respect he has for the host cultures. The exotic, and at times dangerous, locales are not places most of us will ever see, so I'm glad someone is writing great accounts of his adventures there
