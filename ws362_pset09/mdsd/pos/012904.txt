The book features a neat little skip around format, as someone else described, which makes it a handy reference guide in most situations that pop up when dealing with deployment. As my own husband embarqued on his 13 month remote tour of duty to a global hot spot, I clung to this book as if it were my life's blood. I quickly devoured it in less than one night and swore by it for the first few weeks. A lot of this is geared towards your typical military wife (the younger woman with small children under foot and no significant career to speak of) but I like that it's aimed at the Enlisted spouses mroe than the officer spouses, as is the case with so many other books on military relationships. as we crossed the path from "I'm so lost without you!" to "I'm really fine. Days blow right by" stage of the deployment, this book became less and less useful until it found its way on to my book shelf where it has been for a majority of his deployment. 

It really doesn't really offer anything new and insightful. The other military spouse books and general self-help books help quite a bit more when it comes to the in depth issues of lonliness, your child's depression and seperation anxiety, etc. But think of this as a concise reference book more than a guide. the links offered in the back of the book were somewhat outdated as of Sept 2006, but it offers a GIANT list of books that *do* expand on each topic a little further. All in all this is a great book that I highly recomment to my fellow Wives-at-arms when their own spouses are going off to a deployment, but if you're looking for a meaty read, you'd do best to look elsewhere.
