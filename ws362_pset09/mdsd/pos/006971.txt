In this, his seminal work, Alfred Rosenberg offers the reader a genuine alternative to the political and spiritual attitudes which modern Western society leads us to believe are our only options. From every center of  power today we are told that we MUST accept democracy as the only  &quot;good&quot; form of government, that we MUST choose either the  Judeo-Christian tradition, the New Age movement, or secular humanism as our  faith, and that we MUST look to either Adam Smith or Karl Marx for economic  wisdom. In &quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century,&quot; Rosenberg takes  aim at all of these assumptions and presents us with a worldview entirely  different from any of those based upon them--one with its roots deep in  those primeval affective, aesthetic, and intellectual inclinations  characteristic of the Caucasian race. He argues powerfully for an organic  polity as opposed to a universalist one--most specifically in the Germany  of his time--but more generally for Western Civilization as a whole.  At  the heart of his argument is the provocative thesis that each of the races  of the human species possesses a different kind of &quot;soul,&quot; which  is the origin of human cultural diversity.  Environmental influences cannot  account for the differences in style and achievement among the races, he  argues; the respective environmental conditions under which they have lived  have been far too similar to admit of such an explanation.  Advancements in  the scientific understanding of genetics made since Rosenberg's death,  moreover, lend weight to his thesis and make it well worth a thoughful  look. &quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot; will be of interest to  those searching for their identity and its significance amid the anomic  trends of contemporary Western life, as well as those looking for a  socially relavent philosophy with some depth as an alternative to  Establishment prejudices and platitudes
