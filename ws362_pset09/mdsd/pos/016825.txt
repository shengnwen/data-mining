I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn corporate finance. I just finished the first semester of my MBA. I have to say that this is one of the best textbooks I have ever used, and I was fortunate to be able to learn from the lead author of this book, Prof. Scott Smart.

One thing I liked about this book is its flow. This book starts with a brief but very helpful review of basic finance concepts, such as time value of money, and moves on to valuation methods, followed by more in-depth discussions of topics like capital budgeting, capital structure, long-term and short-term financing, options and derivatives, and etc. The organization of its content makes it very easy to follow.

Another thing that I like about this book is the way it's written. As I can attest from my classroom experience, Prof. Smart has the amazing capability to explain complicated concepts in simple languages. This book is so easy to read that you might suspect that its content is too simple. It's not! This book explains important finance concepts in a way that is easy to understand, the way a textbook is supposed to do, and sometimes with humor.

Some additional benefits that come with this book are its online contents. My favorite is Smart Concepts, which are animated slide shows of key concepts for each chapter.  

Although I liked this book, it is not without any drawback. We found several errors in the text and exercise problems. However, these errors are minor and not significant enough for me to lower the rating for this book.
