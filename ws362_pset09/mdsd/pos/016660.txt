If you are a one of the many lovers of phoeniclpteris ruber plasticus,  (pink plastic flamingos), this book will delight you.  It is the story of  the progression of the p.r.p. from its birth in Leominster, MA, to its  spread throughout the United States.  The  book is the collection of photos  summited to the company on the 40th anniversary of the flamingos' entrance  into Amercian culture. Writer Tom Herzing gives a delightful  tongue-in-cheek dialog of the dear birds; the photos chosen are better than  your average bird photos.  THE ORIGINAL PINK FLAMINGOS;Spelndor in the  Grass, makes a wonderful addition to the usual coffee table clutter of  'real art'
