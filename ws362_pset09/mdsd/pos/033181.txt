I have read numerous first hand accounts of World War 2, from both sides, and this was the best. The book was so naturally written and Mr. Foley's graphic descriptions actually made me feel like I was in the Foxhole with him. His story was very moving. Mr. Foley and his generation who risked and gave their lives are truly my hero's. They gave up their innocence so others might be free. Thank you Mr. Foley for what you did, and thank you to the rest of the 94th Infantry division
