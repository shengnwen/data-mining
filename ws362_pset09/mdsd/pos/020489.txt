... the fact that Jenkins and LaHaye knew that basing a book solely on the desecration of the temple would be absolutely horrible, so they crammed this book with as much plot, uspense, turmoil and excitement as they could. Seriously, I was impressed. Or maybe the previous books were so blah that this one seemed really good. Whatever. All I know is I liked it. 

And yes, I know the writing sucks, that the characters are really caracatures and that the plot moves at pace of a Special Olympics event, but really.. I could care less. For every three post-modern, agenda-ridden books that come out and literally make me want to cry, thanks to the headache that comes packaged with them, I like to have one book that is simple, straight-forward and treats me like I've never read before. It's nice for a change. So long as the plot moves.

Thumbs way up for 'Desecration'. It's one of the better books in the series.
