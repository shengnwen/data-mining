This  book is an excellent book.Sometimes she gets on my nerves when she thinks she knows it all. I think thats cool  that all  she talks to  is kids at first.Then she start coming up with all these cures.The cure I like the most is the radish cure .The thing I  liked most was is all the kids think  they can get away with anything.The thing i dislike about it didnt have any  
drama.
