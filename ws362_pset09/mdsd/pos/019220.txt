reading Freud is a must for anyone who is interested in psychology or "psycho-analysis."  He is the founding father for modern psychology and "psycho-analysis" and has become a household name. He has made many other contributions: he coined the famous terms, ego, id, super-ego, "psycho-analysis," unconscious, Oedipus Complex, reaction-formation, identification, free association, object-cathesis, etc.  Although he is known to be extremely hard to   understand I did not find this is so.  This book does have a complex terminology but if you bookmark this page for the other reviewers great work on defining and getting at what Freud really means by the terms ego, id, and super-ego (ego-ideal) and do active reading (taking notes on the margins, underlining, and that type of stuff) its not as hard as everyone thinks.  Take into account though, that Freud homophobic, sexist, anti-semetic, and was alive before many of the modern technological advances were made so brain study was unthinkable back then, and psychology was mainly sexual or childhood development theories used to explain parts of the brain and consciousness.  Although Freud was wrong about alot of things and his method of free association was great for most of his patients (who volunteered to be studied by Freud) it takes too much time for people who dont want to be analyzed or who have trouble talking about their feelings.  Even so, this is a great book and a must read plus its incredibly short.  You also as someone else suggested might want to draw a new model of the brain since freud's one in this book does not include a lot of important details, check the new lectures book for an improved one
