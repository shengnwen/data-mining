The flamboyant poet from Verona, Catullus, who lived most of his life in Rome (84-54 BC), is probably one of the greatest personalities that stands out in Latin literature.  His bold and skillful invective, summed up in witty epigrams, and his gallant love/hate relationship with the famous Lesbia all bring forth sharp reflections upon human emotions and ultimately surface Catullus' own personality.  In these 116 poems, the reader will undoubtedly find something to relate to, even though they were written just over two thousand years ago.  Many of the themes found here are relevant to the modern mind and condition, and seldom are boring and obscure archaisms found in the text.  This complete collection of Catullus' poems, translated by Guy Lee and furnished with a parallel Latin text, is a great edition and indispensable addition to the classical library
