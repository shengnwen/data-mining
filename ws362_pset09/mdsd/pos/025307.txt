This book is divided into two sections. The first section deals primarily with history. The second(which is by far the majority of the books contents) deals with various views of theology pertaining mostly to The Son and Logos' relation to the Father. This book is not one to point empty accusations at Arius, but on the contrary, it provides detailed views on his theological beliefs and also those of Clement and Origen(in a comparitive way). It does not present itself as a very biased work, but states different views (that dont always agree with one another) and compares them to Arius'. It states some views of Arius' accusers and some points of contraversy that they had with His beliefs. It kinda seems to lay out views and explore them. It seems much more like a theological read for the most part rather than a biography of Arius'. It seems very wordy(too much big vocab, especially in the history part)but I would say well worth the time needed to comprehend the points that are presented. It presents interjected Greek sentence fragments and words within the sentences for a clearer understanding of the texts being quoted. I would reccomend it for one who wants to study Arius. However, for a someone who is looking into Biblical exegesis, I (highly) suggest getting, "Restoring the Biblical Christ: Is Jesus God?" It is to the point and very conclusive
