When I first started reading "One Good Knight", I felt sort of let down bordering on disappointment.  But on thinking about it, not every book one reads has to be loaded with deep philisophical plots (ie. the Heralds Of Valdemar Series) and or total character development.  In this light, "One Good Knight" is a very good if not excellent light read.  No need to dwell on subtle subplots.  Good is good, Evil is evil and good will triumph.  Heck, just take any preconcieved blinders off and read this on just for the sheer escapism it offers
