I have read all of the books in this series of Precious and her adventures in the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency. The first book was not what I expected at all.  I am an avid detective and mystery novel reader.
I found the first book in the series was slow at first with lots of background on Botswana, but after I finished the book I found that I truly enjoyed it.  I gave it to  my 80 year old mother and she too liked the book very much! She still asks me if there is anew one in the series; that is a good sign.

I have read each novel, in order, although that is not necessary as they each stand alone.  I have come to love Precious and her family and employee.  The books are well written, interesting and really they are more about life in a country I have never visited and a life I know nothing about.  I enjoy looking into Precious' life.  Many thanks to the Scottish professor and his series of No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency
