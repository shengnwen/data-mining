The story, Do You Know Me?, takes place in Africa where one brother living in a more modern community tries to help his older brother who has had to survive in the bush with only his wits to help him.  Their ways of doing things clash and that's when the fun begins.  Uncle Zeka and his antics had me laughing out loud!  The characters in this story are ones you'll never forget.  My favorite, Tapiwa, is a shy, intelligent girl who learns that the most valuable lessons are not always learned at school.  This is an excellent book to read with your class, teachers
