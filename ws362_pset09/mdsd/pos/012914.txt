It is almost as good as the old one that I lost. I think I have grown up a bit (I hope) since then so some of the humor has lost a little of its edge. The printing quality on the new one was not as good as the original. On some pages it almost appeared that they had photocopied the original to make the new one. I still think maybe the best part is the list of names of all the underclassmen. To come up with those dozens of puns the writers must have stayed up late smoking lots of good stuff
