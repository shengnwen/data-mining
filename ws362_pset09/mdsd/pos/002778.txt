Moreland and Fleisher's text makes up for all the faults of Wheelock's grammar, but is deficient in all the ways that Wheelock is good. 

Intensive Course provides an excellent gramattical base, teaching the subjunctive early (Chapter 2) which aids in learning the usages of this very difficult mood early, and aides in the reading of Latin. The student learns most of the Latin grammar he needs to know by Chapter 18, and the rest of the book drills you in what you have learned. The vocabulary is also more diverse than in Wheelock's Latin. 

However the draw backs of the text are that the authors chose to make up practice sentences to test grammar that are inherently "un-Roman", and not always accurate. Sometimes the exercises employ grammar that hasn't been learned yet. The good teacher can steer one around that, but it would be difficult to teach yourself without some knowledge of Latin Grammar to start with. 

After having taught Latin for 2 years, I have found that the best thing is to use Wheelock on the side to introduce its classical sentences and the examples therein to suppliment. 

Pedagogical note: It would be best for teachers to introduce students to the full text of De Bello Gallico of Caesar after Chapter 18, since it is generally agreed that Caesar has the purest classical Latin of any text we possess. This is the best way to make up for Moreland and Fleisher's shortcomings.
