The heroine made the book in my opinion.  And Max's family, the McCords.  But without Low Down,the book would not have been as good.  I really enjoyed the details of the book and wish there'd been more detail to her work in the house, their work on the farm, etc.  
Another reviewer is right about Max, he was nothing to write home about as far as romantic men go.  But what Louise fell in love with was the family, the house, the home... all the things she'd never had.  
Any man would fall in love with a woman who not only is a workhorse cooking, cleaning, farm chores etc., but also has a gorgeous healthy, voluptuous body and strips for him in the kitchen.  Please.  Louise was like slave labor and free sex for him.  
But what really cost this book the 5-star rating I'd have liked to have given was the lame ending.  Why oh why didn't she tell him at the end she was carrying his child.  That just killed me and annoyed me to no end.  That the reader doesn't even get the satisfaction of knowing the reaction of the man.  The same man who swooned over Philadelphia when he thought SHE was carrying his child.
