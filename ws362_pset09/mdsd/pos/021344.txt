Once again, Sybex has come through with a great resource for CCNP studies.  I have trained hundreds of students in pursuit of their CCNP certification with this book.  

As the IT Mentor CCNP Boot Camp instructor, I selected this book library years ago as my primary resource for the class.  My students find the books easy to read and full of usefull information.  The labs are very good, and overall, the book is great.

Once again, my only problem with Sybex is that their books have a large amount of typos and errors in the first few editions
