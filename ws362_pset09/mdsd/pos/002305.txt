William Rorabaugh, an associate professor of History at the University of Washington, provides a very interesting study of alcoholic consumption in the United States from the 18th century through the mid 1800s.  He looks at the issue from the supply side (expense and technology in the production of distilled beverages and the import of rum) and the demand side.  There is some eye-opening information in this work.  The annual per capita consumption of alcohol between 1800-1830 exceeded 5 gallons; nearly triple today's consumption (p. 8).  The demand for alcohol (particularly whiskey) stemmed from such things as alleged medical and dietary benefits, social camaraderie, a way to cope with a rapidly changing society, and such particle reasons as the lack of alternatives (water and milk was unhealthy and other substitutes were comparatively expensive) and strong beverages were needed to overcome the bland, monotonous American diet.  Rorabaugh also devotes much of this study to the medical and moral critics of alcohol, including temperance societies.  One doctor in the 1740s favored moderation: "not more than one bottle of wine each evening" (p. 32).   I believe there is a lot of over-generalization in this study, especially when disillusionment over the voting system and the burden of living up to the ideals of the independent man are used as reasons for drinking (although drinking probably came before such feelings).  Still, the book is extremely well-researched, with source notes at the end and several appendixes on estimating consumption of alcohol, cross-national comparisons of consumption, and cook books.  The text, excluding the appendixes, is 222 pages and includes illustrations
