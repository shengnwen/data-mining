Future cop Lieutenant Eve Dallas rides again to meet a new foe who threatens the one thing she has ever truly cared for.  Billionaire Roarke, the richest and most handsome man on or off planet, has crossed swords before with the more than shady Max Ricker in the darker days of his past.  While Roarke operates only in the light these days, there are those who would like to see him dragged right back to where he began.
 
When a young police officer is beaten to death, every local cop wants to give a hand in the hunt to find the killer.  A baseball bat has been used on the off-duty officer who was working nights at a local strip joint called "Purgatory".  For a man known to have no enemies, the brutality of his killing stuns everyone.  It takes some serious digging from Eve and her sidekick Officer Peabody to find a connection to the notorious Max Ricker.  The death of another officer suspected to be on the take to Ricker links the two cases to police internal affairs who would like the whole investigation squashed.   Add a troubled police captain into the mix, and there's a whole lot of people who feature on Eve's suspect list.
 
The relationship scenes in "Judgment in Death" are some of the best in the series.  If you are an Eve and Roarke fan you'll delight in the spats the dynamic duo have with the additional element of a third party -Eve's pre-marital one night stand, Webster.  The crime plotline meanders to the point that a resolution is just a bonus. Robb is at the top of her form here when it comes to her created 2058 environment of New York and the sharp, witty characters she has populated it with.  Great fun read for fans and would definitely hook in the new reader who has heard great things of the romantic suspense contained in the hugely successful '"in Death" series.
