What would you think if you loved baseball and you happened to be one of the best little league players in the Bronx. But there is one problem. You are not eligible to play. 
This is what happened to 12-year-old Michael Arroyo.  Michael immigrated with his brother Carlos from Cuba. There is one big problem that is major in this book that is too good to tell. Michael's loyal friend Manny was on his baseball team as well.
 It turns out that Michael's amazing arm was useful in the real world. From Yankee Stadium he threw a baseball and hit a person who stole a purse in the head with the ball. He was truly invincible. 
         I think that the biggest theme of this book is perseverance. It means don't stop trying even though times are bad and things aren't going to well. 
	The genre is sports fiction with also a little drama in it. This book is for anyone to read. All of Mike Lupica's books are sports books. He actually is part of the sports show called the Sports Reporters. 
  To find out more, read this book and I guarantee that you won't put it down.
