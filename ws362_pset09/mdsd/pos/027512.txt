This book was ahead of its time.  The clichï¿½s Pearl Buck captured 70 years ago still hold true today:  

"Behind every good man is a strong woman."

"A fool and his money are soon parted."

"Money can't buy happiness."

"Women are the root of all evil." 

Suggested appetizers: 

Safeway sweet and sour sauce
Egg Rolls
Boneless Chicken
Little smokies in BBQ sauce
Fortune cookies

We were very fortunate that the ancient Chinese Proverbs from our fortune cookies harmonized with our initial comments and truly enriched our discussion. 
"A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step."

"When you are poor, neighbors close by will not come; once you become rich, you'll be surprised by visits from (alleged) relatives afar."

"Without rice, even the cleverest housewife cannot cook."

A few other comments: 

O'Lan truly was the Good Earth. 

At the end of the book, you have to ask yourself: who really is the Poor Fool?

The Ribbons and Rifles Book Club...tune in for next month's book review (The Glass Castle).
