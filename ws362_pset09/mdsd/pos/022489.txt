I would have never believed I would more than skim this book when I began it;  what a surprise!  It was like the most incredible miniseries imaginable. Unbelievable true stories of heroism and cruelty and larger than life characters.  The author has a way of making you want to keep turning pages.  Best book I've read in a long time
