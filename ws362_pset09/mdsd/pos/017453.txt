I will keep this very brief.  I am an electrical  engineer and computer scientist, and, after a couple of decades in the &quot;commercial world&quot; ,  am always amazed at the &quot;unreal effectiveness&quot; of mathematics when applied to this and the real world.  Bell's book captures this essence in a timeless tome that must be required reading and regular re-reading for all aspiring. and indeed, practising,  mathematicians, engineers and scientists.  It is a source of both inspiration and &quot;bringing back to earth&quot; to those that read it.  No serious practitioners library should be without it
