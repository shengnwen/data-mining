I really wasn't expecting much from this novel.  In fact, I'm not sure what even led me to pick it up.  Suffice to say I was pleasantly surprised.  This is one of the few Star Wars books I've read that contains almost no references to the main characters from any of the movies, and that's what makes it so refreshing.  The idea of a Star Wars MASH unit may sound a little cheesy, but the book doesn't try to be 'Star Wars ER' rather it's much more of a character-driven novel that emphasizes the human cost of the Clone Wars.  It's nice to see Star Wars novelists finally stop trying to create characters who can "out-Vader" Darth Vader and instead focus on the personalities who populate the Star Wars universe
