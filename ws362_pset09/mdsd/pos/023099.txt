A South Pacific hurricane nearly killed Mafatu, a Polynesian Island boy, when he was three.  Currents from the impending storm had carried the canoe that his mother navigated out to sea, where the hurricane-sized waves capsized it.  Clinging to the outrigger pole, Mafatu's mother managed to fight off sharks and dehydration long enough to reach a coral reef after several days adrift: "At hand lay a cracked coconut; the woman managed to press the cool, sustaining meat to her child's lips before she died" [p10].  Ever since, Mafatu was afraid of the sea.

This book was originally written in 1940 and is illustrated by the author.  It's five chapters are subtitled "Flight", "The Sea", "The Island", "Drums", and "Homeward".  It is a Rite of Passage story where Mafatu is teased and taunted by his mates because of his fear of the sea.  Eventually Mafatu can no longer tolerate the jeers nor the silent contempt that his dad holds for him, and he sets off in a canoe with his two pals - a dog and albatross, to run away from the island of taunts.  

Out in the Pacific Ocean, a storm and its currents grab the boy's craft taking it on an unknown course while its waves rob the craft of its stores and supplies.  Mafatu and his dog, Uri, are battered at storm's end and the albratross, Kivi, must step up and guide the gang to land - The Island.  Exploring the island, he discovers it is used by the "eaters-of-men" to make sacrifices to a statue - he had landed on Forbidden Island!

The remainder of the book is about how Mafatu comes of age while learning to survive and be resourceful.  When he and his dog eventually return to their home island with the eaters-of-men in hot pursuit most of the way, they return (thanks to Kivi's navigational assistance) to a see a cold father no longer cold and jeering villagers no longer jeering.  Mafatu, the Stout Heart, has proved he has earned his name
