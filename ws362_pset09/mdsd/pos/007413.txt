As a mom of a child with severe multiple food allergies to wheat, egg, dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, and fish, I am truly grateful for this book.  I own almost every food allergy cookbook published.  But Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook is by far my favorite!!  Most cookbooks labeled allergen free are written for the gluten free diets with subsitutions at the bottom.  All the recipes in this book are truly written allergen free! There are great recipes that our whole family enjoys.  Most of the time I have to cook seperate recipes to appeal to everyone--not anymore!  These recipes are appetizing to my 6 yr. old and my husband who doesn't even realize he is eating healthy with these recipes.  These recipes make meal time truly a family experience again.
