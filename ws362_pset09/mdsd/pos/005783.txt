Maybe I didn't read the editorial comments correctly before I ordered this book, but it is not what I wanted.

I was looking for information about starting a gift basket *business*. This book does not cover that topic.

It is a very nice book about making baskets as gifts for friends, neighbors, teachers, service people, etc. 

There are some full-color pictures, though not of every basket idea. The resource list is strictly retail. Recipes are included for basket items, a no-no when you're selling baskets unless you have a licensed commercial kitchen.

So, while the book might jump-start your brain for basket ideas as gifts, it is not a business book.

My problem, not the book's.
