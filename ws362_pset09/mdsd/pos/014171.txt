I rarely pick up this sort of novel; I'm more likely to read a historical mystery or a thoughtful SF book. But I very much enjoyed this police procedural book, because the characters are well-drawn, the original premise is compelling (whyever would someone want to kill a 16-year-old kid in a library?), and the author does a dandy job of throwing the reader off her assumptions.

This is the first Deaver book I read, and I was somewhat concerned that I'd be a little lost since there were apparently several other Lincoln Rhyme novels. Not to worry: you won't feel as though you arrived ten minutes late to a movie. What you need to know is all here
