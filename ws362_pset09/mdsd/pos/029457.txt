I bought this book at Amazon.com because I just had to have it.  I'm no Ducatisti, but I can appreciate Ducati racing history and I'll check out a Duc when I find one to look over the carbon fiber, expensive gold bits, and the chicken strips on the tires. And the famous Ducs are all here in this book for me to eye whenever I want. You get the usual development and racing history of each model in this book, but best of all, you get  great pictures of vicious old Italian racers in black leathers and big 2-page layouts of the famous racers like Mike "The Bike" Hailwood's 900, Lucky's 750 F1, Doug Polen's 888 Superbike, and Foggy's 916. These pictures let you really get in there to inspect honest rock chips, race scrapes and battle scars. I took one star away from my rating because the text reads like a corny, congratulatory sales brochure, but it is the "Official Racing History" from the constructor so what do you expect? This book is pure motorcycle porn. If you love sportbikes or motorcycles in general, you need this book. It's worth every penny. Enjoy the ducs, but Ride Red
