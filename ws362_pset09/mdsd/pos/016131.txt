And there's plenty of it to be found in Higg's work. This book is truly unique in several ways, one being that it's practically an anthology as well as a guidebook. Also, Higgs blessedly does NOT paint unrealistically good-girl pictures of what we should be like; her brutally honest recounting of her past is part of this. I found her transformation of old stories into new absolutely brilliant and insightful and her humor and bluntness often hilarious. Inspite of her occasional gushing of Christ (can you blame her?) and her extremely affectionate terms of endearment for the reader, Higgs never came across to me as condescending or fake. In fact, she's more real than certain people I've actually met. Some female Christian authors give the impression of being either the dance-through-daisies type or the whip-in-hand type that you can't at all relate to, but Higgs is wonderfully flesh and blood as well as Godly, which not everyone can accomplish! One feminist claimed that Higgs believes in women being submissive to men, but let's give her a little more credit here! While she does make a comment about wives submitting to their husbands, she only does this once and never says that women should be submissive in general. If there's one thing Higgs is not, it's a doormat. If you'd like a down-to-earth and entertaining Christian guide, I highly recommend both "Bad Girl" books as well as "Mad Mary" (read the latter with a bunch of tissues, though). Higgs is truly in a class by herself :) God Bless you, Liz
