First of all, the 133 illustrations in this thin little volume are excellent, resplendent with Masonic symbolism and indicative of Freemasonry's multifaceted history. True, a few of the pictures are just a bit tangential to the subject at hand, though these do serve the function of showing the larger context of Freemasonry, that which has influenced it and that which has been influenced by it. But by far the majority give the reader a very well-rounded and fascinating visual crash-course in Freemasonry itself. Still, it is a crash-course, a starting point for the uninitiated but interested outsider like me and perhaps a lavish but cursory review for those who have gone deeper into the subject.

The text of the book comes in two parts, an extended introductory essay and brief captions accompanying the many illustrations. The former is a bit eccentric, interpreting the three degrees of Freemasonry in the light of Jungian psychology and briefly explaining the diagrams depicting each along those lines. In general this seemed persuasive for the most part and  worked well in making the rituals and images intelligible, but as the author makes clear at the beginning this is by no mean the official interpretation or even necessarily a common one. I can't help but feel that addressing the standard Masonic understanding and then adding the Jungian spin might have made this book a little more helpful. As for the latter, the captions do a pretty good job in placing the illustrations, but very little of the rich symbolism is explained in any depth, and much flies by with no comment. I tended to find this just a bit frustrating, though perhaps the short format of the book makes it inevitable. That being so, it might have made sense to enlarge the spotty bibliography at the end into a "suggested reading" page for those whose curiosity was thus aroused. And with such a wealth of intriguing images, this fine little book can scarcely fail to have that effect
