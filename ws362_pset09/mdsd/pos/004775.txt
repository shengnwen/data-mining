I first learned field theory about 3 decades ago.  On a whim i picked up Zee's "Nutshell" to refresh my memory.  I was so engrossed that i spent all of Saturday and Sunday one weekend absorbing half the book, to my wife's dismay.  Zee has a talent for explaining the most abstruse and arcane concepts in an elegant way, using the minimum number of equations (the jokes and anecdotes help).  To the motivated physics major who has just finished his/her first quantum mechanics course (or the beginning grad student), i warmly recommend Zee's book.  I wish this was available when i was a graduate student.  Buy the book, keep it by your bed, and relish the insights delivered with such flair and grace in each chapter.  This is a beautiful intro to the most splendid theoretical edifice of our age -- field theory
