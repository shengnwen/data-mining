This is a very short book - there aren't many poems.  They are very cruel, almost disturbingly so unless you have the sort of sense of humor that embraces Edward Gorey's little alphabet recital ("B is for Basil, devoured by bears").  I do share that sense of humor and so found this book to be entertaining, and a suitable gift for some similarly-minded people on my gift list.  It has b/w illustrations
