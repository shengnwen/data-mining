    Tyson has a solid writing style and makes for a surprisingly easy read.  Financial concepts I once thought complex are explained in straight forward terms and are easily comprehended.  The book includes a wonderful index and now serves as a desktop reference book alongside my dictionary and writing texts -- it's that good.

     I deducted one star from my rating because the book does have shortcomings.  The book could be more concise, Tyson often writes the same thing several times throughout a chapter.  While some may view this as learning through reiteration, it causes my eyes to glaze over.  The book could be 10% shorter.  There is also one instance in the book where Tyson mentions the September 11th terrorist attacks in the same sentence as drunk driving -- implying something that I did not feel comfortable inferring.  Also, at one point Tyson comments on how many marriages are broken up by poor finances, without citing a source.

     Overall, I say buy this book.  What could be greater than the security of knowing that you and your loved ones can be provided for?  Follow the advice in this book and you will not have to worry about what other people do with their money, because you will have your own.
