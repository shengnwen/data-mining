I've seen several negative reviews on this site and others about this installment in the series.  The biggest complaint is the lack of action in the book.  I have to say that if you been reading this series just for the action, then you will be a bit disappointed, as the action is spread out and sparse in Feast.  But, if you enjoy the richness of the world and the characters, and want to further immerse into the Martin's world, you will be fulfilled from page to page.  This novel I think is completely necessary, showing the desolation of a world so recently torn by war.  People are gathering up, new plots are starting, and you can feel that things are teetering on the brink of exploding into a new era in Westeros.  The complete development of the characters and their inner struggles keeps things interesting even when the realm is experiencing a relative lull of fragile peace.  Martin is an amazing storyteller, and a very in-tune humanist.  I've been completely spoiled by this series, and Feast is no exception
