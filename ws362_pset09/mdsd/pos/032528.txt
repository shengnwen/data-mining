This is a great reference point to start and if you're serious about creating a good business for yourself then read this book.
I also suggest that you read Untapped Wealth Discovered by Jeff Marquis and Kerry Harrison.
This book is very focused on helping you to create niche businesses in niche markets that are ripe for the taking.
Moreover, this book has the approval of the American government plus several business experts worldwide and you should read both editions.
Read both editions
