I thought this book would be Brit Chick-Lit with some aristocracy thrown in, but was in for a surprise.  It's an analysis of the British upper class and the aspirations of the middle class through the story of Edity Lavery who catches herself an Earl.  
The adjustments she must make trying to fit in makes an interesting story.  Actually each scene gets analyzed from different angles, but for an American reader the rehashing of tone of voice and raised eyebrow is probably necessary.  
Much of the story would have passed me by without the explanations that accompany it through the voice of a well-born actor, the earl's mother, Edith herself, and a host of other characters.
Things get messy when Edith finds life in a stately home a crashing bore.  Intrigued by a handsome actor, she contemplates chucking the prestigious marriage that she worked so hard to achieve.
