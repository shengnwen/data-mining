I bought this book because I have been diagnosed with a cardiac problem.  I need to lose weight.  I also have a few other health issues so being able to put good food on the table quickly is a must for me. This book gives wonderful recipes for doing just that. I've had the book for 2 weeks and I've used it nearly every day. And even the times I haven't used it, I've used the "good food fast" principles as I cook.  

As has been mentioned, the recipes don't call for a lot of things I don't already have in my pantry, or for fancy cooking tools I have never owned. It's practical, realistic and tasty.  This food does not taste like "healthy" food.  It's great.  

I would have liked more menu suggestions, but other than that, I'd say, if you want to re-vamp the way you eat without jumping on the South Beach (or other "radical" diet) bandwagon, get this book.
