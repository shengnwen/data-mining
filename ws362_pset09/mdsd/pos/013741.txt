&quot;Tree of Life&quot; is a educational storybook, which tells the story of biological evolution from before the first form of life appeared, to the appearance of the first humans, and all in words even a preschooler can  understand.

The large, beautiful purple  and white illustrations  also make it as enjoyable to look at as it is to   read
