Follow the Larkin family on their journey from Indiana to Oregon in 1853 in search of a more prosperous life.  This book uses actual pictures of objects from the past, many drawings,and diary writings. Their journey took almost 5 months, the family had to travel over 2,000 miles.Some of the 24 chapters include The Wagon, Indian Country, Children's Activities, Crossing A River, Stopping At A fort, Sickness and Death.  A greatly detailed book with an abundance of color pictures on every page. Fantastic!
