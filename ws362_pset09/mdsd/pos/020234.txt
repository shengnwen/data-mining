 Perhaps it was my surroundings at the time I first read this delightful book that makes me like it so much,
 (first visit to a naturist resort)
but, after several reads I've developed quite a thing for it. 
   It alternates for the top spot on my list with Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac and Beryl Markham's West with the Night depending on my mood...
  I picked it up off the shelf at Barnes and Noble because I'm a Carl Hiassen fan and enjoyed his other colabrotive effort, A Death in China with Bill Montalbano.  
  (I have since purchaced many other new and used copies for friends)
  I also needed something to read while burning parts of my body that have not seen the sun in decades to an unattractive crispy bright red. 
(something naturist resorts don't alert novices to in the brochure...) 
  the shifts in style from chapter to chapter make it that much more interesting, just when you start to think it's too masculine, a touch of the femenine intervines to round it out.  
 
 To sum it up I guess, 
   if your tastes in literature twist towards nature, 
 international intrigue,
  or the simple pleasures of nudity,
   this book is quite the enjoyable romp. 
 
 (SPF 30+ is recommended if you read it on the beach, trust me.)
