William Shakespeare: The Complete Works is a good book, but excuse me for saying this, but Shakespeare is so overrated.

If he tried to publish today, I doubt he could get a company to publish his works.

The main question is:  Do we like Shakespeare because he was talented, or is it too PC to say he is overrated
