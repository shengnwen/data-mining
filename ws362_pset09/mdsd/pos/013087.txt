I like this book. It is good for the beginner, though it focuses mainly on fundamentals. The Fundamentals, however are well explained, which is an added plus as I think that not many beginners focus on foundamentals enough. 

Overall I think it was well written and the authors try to throw some humour in there to keep you interested. Go ahead and buy it you will not be disappointed
