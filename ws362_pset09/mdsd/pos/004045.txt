This really cool "prequel" answers once and for all the burning questions you have been harboring about the man-child who lives in Neverland with other little boys.  No, no - not THAT one, I'm talking about Peter Pan, the fairy-loving, pirate-hating leader of the Lost Boys. (Same thing, you say - but that's a different story altogether)

It seems that Peter Pan was an orphan, who was put aboard a ship with other orphaned boys, en route to a shortened life of serving the evil King Zarboff the Third, when a chance meeting with a little girl and a mysterious crate leads to a wonderful adventure beyond his wildest dreams.

The answers to the following questions are just 480 well-spaced quick-turning pages away:

1.	How did Peter Pan get to Neverland?
2.	Where the heck is it anyway?
3.	Where does pixie dust come from and why is it addictive?
4.	Tinkerbell - fairy who looks like Julia Roberts or bird brain?
5.	Mermaids - fish or just plain foul?
6.	What made the natives restless?
7.	Should you ever give a crocodile a hand?

An often funny, action-packed piratical yarn that's sure to delight most young readers.
