Let's be clear: this is not a work of serious scholarship. It's best to see it  as an extended riff on the culture and social fabric of the late middle ages.  It reads like an brisk and extended (and at times distracted) conersation that uses the plague as a jumping-off point and gives a broad impression of late medieval life.  It's a one-sided conversation, sure, but it's one you'll learn a lot from, even though at times  it's too snarky and off-handed to be taken entirely seriously. But those qualities also work in favor of the book, making it a fun read if you don't get too distracted by the overused catch-phrases ("biomedical devastation," for example) and the gratuitous speculation.  Drink a glass of wine and enjoy
