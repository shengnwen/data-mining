Review: "The Big Idea: Focus The Message, Multiply The Impact"

A Leadership Network Innovation Series by 
Dave Ferguson, Jon Ferguson, and Eric Bramlett

A Review by Dr. Henry Judy

It has been a long time since there was a book published that has the God ordained ability to impact the church in such a huge way as The Big Idea. For a long time, I have been saying that the people in churches today for the most part are just NOT getting it. We think it is a program problem but it is not. It is a process problem and Dave Ferguson, with Jon Ferguson, and Eric Bramlett have not only brought the problem to the forefront, but provided a process for correction. Hence the concept of "The Big Idea." 

Now what is paramount is that this process is not hypothetical in nature. It is a proven concept being used with great success by Community Christian Church in Naperville, Ill. So it works and it will work in every single church out there that is serious about the Jesus Mission. How do we know it works? It is measurable. Not only in terms of individual transformations but in terms of fruitful reproduction of other churches. 

The Big idea is the gasoline that will be the foundation for life change in a new movement of reproducing churches. It is Spirit written, Spirit, conceived, and Spirit applicable and if you are serious about wanting to reach people for Jesus and have their lives transformed, then you will devour this book like Momma's Sweet Potato Pie.

Buy This Book and put its principles to work if you want to be a part of people's lives being transformed.
