I used to watch those video based tutorials, and I thought that I was learning a lot of stuff from them, but the reallity was other... I just watched them and in a month or so, I couldnt remember many things. That happened to me with motion video based tutorials, until I  bought this book, the excercises are very cool and very easy to understand, there are included many files to work with in the cdrom and some inconclused excersices for you to finish them if you've fallen behind.

Another goood thing is that includes a chapter for sound editing in motion, another for drawing gestures (using a digital tablet and stylus), and they forgot to mention in the description that this book is fully compatible with Motion 2.

I recommend it
