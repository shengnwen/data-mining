Upon the recommendation of the owner of the mountain lodge where we stayed in Otavalo, Ecuador, I ordered Andean Entrepreneurs following our return home.  Lynn Meisch has written a highly readable book about the people and commerce of that region, well-researched and full of interesting detail.  It is warm and human, reflecting her love of the Otavaleños, with whom she lived for long periods of time.  It was fascinating to learn so much about the music, the style of dress, customs, families, entrepreneurial spirit, and long-standing skill with weaving and textiles among these kind people with whom I had enjoyed an interesting visit.  This book will be quite valuable for anyone contemplating a visit to Ecuador, or who has returned from time spent there
