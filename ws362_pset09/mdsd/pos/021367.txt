If you have ever enjoyed any Carl Hiaasen novels about the abuse that Florida's environment has taken from developers, crooked politicians and ne'er-do-wells of all kinds, Double Whammy is one of his finest accomplishments.  That's primarily due to Mr. Hiaasen's loving introduction of his great comic (and tragic) character, Skink.  Early in the book, Skink (who appears in so many later novels in the series) joins the story as he combines to help R. J. Decker find out how a famous fisherman has been cheating in bass fishing contests.  In fact, this book has more Skink in it than any other Hiaasen novel.  If you are a Skink fan, this is a five-star effort.   

The book's premise turns out to be but a red herring for a more sinister plot that soon threatens both Skink and Decker.  

Mr. Hiaasen's rapier-like wit leaves his targets walking around with their heads cut off without realizing it, as they do one foolish thing after another that lead them to their inevitable doom.  Some of the targets include unethical real estate developers, television evangelists, bass fishermen, sporting event sponsors and the idle rich.  If you enjoy seeing any of those pilloried, this is a fine book for you.

The book contains one of the most diabolical dispatching of a villain that I have ever read.  It's a masterpiece.

The book does have a drawback.  Mr. Hiaasen seems to have fallen in love with his story.  After the premise is confounded, the story takes too long to develop.  It becomes a page turner . . . not because you cannot wait to get to the next part, but because you want the book to reach its inevitable end sooner.
