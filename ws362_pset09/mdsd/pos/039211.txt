Four volumes in and no clunkers yet, this guy had something special . . . and his Hugo and Nebula winning short story is still about thirty years away.  Wow.  If you've been following along all this time let me just say  that this volume will give you more pleasures than any writer had any right  to give you, most writers have a couple truly amazing short stories within  them and while not everything Sturgeon wrote was genius the sheer amount of  good stuff here is simply astounding.  &quot;Thunder and Roses&quot; has to  be one of the most humane stories ever written and others like &quot;There  is No Defense&quot; or &quot;The Professor and the Teddy Bear&quot; (if it  doesn't scare you, you must not have a pulse) stand up remarkably well.   Again, you owe it to get every volume of this series and save it for the  generations to come, we have so few literate writers these days and those  few that we have deserve to be remembered and enjoyed.  Sturgeon is one.   Read him
