Seidensticker's offering in 'FUTURE HYPE' gives us a clearer look at how technology change really happens, its impact on society and how significantly technology has actually changed our lives - both on a business and personal level.

Weighing the real benefits against the hype, he asks us to consider the way things were done in the past to avoid 'technology infatuation'. Benefits of usable products produced by technology is the real measure of its worth, not the technology hype itself that we are seduced into buying.

He vaccinates us with an injection of cynicism so we can better anticipate the future and make more appropriate decisions to acquire useful technological purchases. "High Tech purchases must be held accountable, like any other purchase," he says. "Don't jump on the 'hype' bandwagon without good reason."

There is great benefit to heed Seidensticker's wisdom and experience in this very readable book. Carol Bentley, Autho
