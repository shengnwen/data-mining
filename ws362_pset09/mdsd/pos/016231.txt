I bought this book for the beach, looking for something light, and I could not put it down.  Stephanie Plum was easy to relate to, and the book was very funny at times.  My only complaint, being from New Jersey (near Trenton), were the Jersey stereotypes.  First, the only "radioactive" areas in Jersey are near Elizabeth and Newark.  Second, we DO NOT wear turquoise or midnight blue eyeliner with cherry red lipstick, spandex shorts, and gold hoop earrings...maybe in the 80's, but not in '94.  Third, the dialect was a little off.  We don't start out any sentence with "probably."  Once I got past the false "jerseyisms" I was able to get more into the characters.  I guess I would have enjoyed it more if I weren't from Jersey
