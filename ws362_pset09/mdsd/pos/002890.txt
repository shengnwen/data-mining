It's unfortunate that so many reviewers infer that this book outlines a way of manipulating prospects. Sandler begins the book by sharing the mistakes he personaly made in selling. The primary science used to develop most of the techniques is called Transactional Analysis. There are many good books on Amazon that cover TA including "I'm OK, You're OK" and "Born to Win." The primary emphasis in this (easy to read) book is about giving some control back to the beaten down salesperson that is sick and tired of being rejected. TA is certainly not about manipulating people.

Sandler simply shows how traditional selling methodologies can negatively impact the salesperson's psyche. If you have no trouble with rejection and don't mind spinning your wheels with prospects that intentionally misrepresent their intentions to you, then you really don't need this book. Otherwise, I highly recommend it
