Many people were disappointed by Smith's most recent novel, "The Ruins" (although I wasn't one of them) so I knew I had to read Smith's first novel to see how it compared.  The truth is there is no comparison that can be made as "A Simple Plan" is as far removed from "The Ruins" - genre-wise, story-wise, everything-wise- as a novel can be.  If there could be a true comprison made for this book, it would be Woody Allen's film, "Crimes and Misdemeanors."  That an author can write two such different novels AND succeed with both is an achievement.  

Smith is a damn good writer and this tale, a story as simple as Hank Mitchell's plan, is riveting.  There wasn't one point in this novel where I wasn't worried that if I turned the page, everything would come out in the open.  Between Hank's simple plan, his wife Sarah's murderous lucidity and the growing body count, there is never a dull moment.  I do confess that by the end of the book, I was starting to feel like the widening circle of death was getting a bit too extreme (for those who only know the film version of the novel, they diverge in a major way halfway through so the book will be a new experience) but at the same time, if I was Hank Mitchell, what would I have done?  That's a question I kept asking myself and still do.
