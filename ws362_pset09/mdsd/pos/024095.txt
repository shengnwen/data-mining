I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.  I bought it as a remainder for next to nothing and was pre-reading it to see when my niece would be old enough for it -- if it were good enough to give her, that is.  As it turns out, I find myself jealous of her getting to be old enough to read it, because I think she's going to dive in and only surface for meals.  

One reason I liked this book so much, I think, is because the theory of quantum alternate universes is an idea that I find very persuasive and comforting.  As a result, this novel gives me more food for thought to chew over while it also mixes in the "supernatural" aspects of the family tree, the oddly old and young Aldous, and so on.  As an adult who was once a child who experienced a painful loss of a loved one, I found the treatment of grief to be very affecting as well.

I was disappointed to find that the second Withern Rise book is not yet out in paperback.  My niece has probably 4 years until she's old enough to start the trilogy, and I hope I'll have finished all three before then.  ;-)

The one argument I have with the book is the rather spare style in which it's written.  It feels to me as if some coloring and fleshing out is missing, although from reading the author's comments in the essays at the end of the volume, I can see that's a deliberate choice of his.  This difference in taste is far from sufficient to turn me off the book, however
