Osborne Russell was never one of the elite of the Mountain Men.  He spent most of his time in the mundane tasks of cooking, cleaning, and other camp chores while on trapping expeditions.  But he wrote one of the best accounts -- certainly one of the most accurate -- of the peregrinations and the exciting events in the life of a Mountain Man.  Osborne was in the Northern Rockies between 1834-1943 and was a minor participant in many expeditions and fights with the Blackfeet.  

Editor Haines has compiled the routes of Russell's travel in 10 maps and added explanatory notes to his narrative.  However, a lot more could be done to make this book more readable.  First, there are no chapter or paragraph divisions to ease the task of the reader.  It's even hard to keep track of what year Russell is talking about.  Secondly, there is room for many, many more footnotes and explanations of what Russell was doing and when and where.  

We need a new edition of Russell's work which will make it more accessible to the reader.  This old edition is invaluable if you are a student of the Mountain Man, but the casual reader will bog down.
