This is a pretty good book.  It gives you the basics on deep fryers (makes and models, safety, helpful hints, ect...) Lots of good and new recipies  that I never knew you could do in a deep fryer.  So now it doesn't just sit  around until I do fries, I can now use it for other things too. There are  recipies in here for apetizers, breads, meats, deserts, and much more.  I  really enjoyed it
