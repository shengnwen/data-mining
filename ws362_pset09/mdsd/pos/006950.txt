Having lived in the Boston area during the Blizzard of 1978 I was very intrigued with this topic. I was not disappointed. I have read other books and articles by Tougias and am always taken by his writing. Tougias traces the day and evening of the blizzard, comparing the storm to other sea disasters and the amazing swell of activity in Gloucester harbor and sea. The characters Tougias describes in the book brought every aspect of the events out in a very personal, human way. I received this as a Christmas gift and could not put it down until I reached the end. It is a most engaging read
