For all of us who lost a loved one to suicide, we automatically feel guilty for not seeing it coming, or being able to stop it.
Here is a book who's author is a thearpist and her son is in a treatment plan and he succeeds, in his suicide..
Her book helps you see all aspects of suicide, and if possible see how with all our efforts, we couldn't stop it..
It's excellent and my support group all found it extremely helpful.
