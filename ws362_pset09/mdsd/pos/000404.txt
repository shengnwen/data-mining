My favorite books include Tristram Shandy and The Adventures of Pergrine Pickle; thus I could not pass up this source material as explication of much of the substance of 19th century English literary humor.  As the last  reviewer noted, one copy is simply not enough.  I am ordering an additional  4 as I speak.  We create an enormous amount of waste during on sentient  sojurn herein.  Ignoring it serves no purpose; the attention paid by Mr.  Lewin may serve none as well, but it certainly assuages years of curiosity  and provides lots of entertainment
