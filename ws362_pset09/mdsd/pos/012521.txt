As beginners' books go, this is about as good as it gets. Most books assume you know stuff. This one starts from zero and takes you as far as you care to go. 

I gave a copy to each of my daughters so they could learn about investing earlier and better than I did. It's very readable, very thorough. 

Had I started with this book instead of randomly taking whatever my library had I believe my learning curve would have not stayed level near 0 for as long as it did. The title--for Dummies--put me off, and that was a mistake in judgement. 

I think there's room for improvement, so only 4 stars, but you won't find much better
