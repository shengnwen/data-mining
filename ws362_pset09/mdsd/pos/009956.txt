This was actually one of the first books I read on my own after I finished high school. And by far, I think it is THE best book I have ever read! When I started reading this book, I thought the premise was original. It took me a little while to understand what was going on as there were "time gaps" in the story. But after reading it, you realize everything going on. And it is one of the books I recommend to everyone who wants something to read. I have read it 5 times myself, and it will definitely be a staple in my book collection
