The recipes are simple and almost foolproof.  I regularly make the Light Basil Sauce which I find far superior to your regular basil pesto.  Make the spaghetti recipe with it, it's fast food that takes about as long as the pasta needs to cook.  I would highly recommend making the Roasted Chicken stuffed with Figs and Rice (that may not be the exact title).  It's truly delicious.  The instructions for roasting are the best that I've come across thus far.  Now I can roast a chicken that is evenly cooked and golden brown. The stuffing is fabulous, so haven't changed a thing.  While recipe uses a ~5lb chicken, I've made it with 3-4 lb birds and just froze the remaining stuffing in the freeze for the next time that I make this recipe.  All the recipes are relatively short and the directions are quite clear.  Can't wait to try some of the lamb recipes
