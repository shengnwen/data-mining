A huge amount if info in a small package. Sure, the writing style is a little dry but there's so many interesting points it won't put you to sleep. I'm not sure "Reference" is a good description though; in some respects it reads more like a classroom text - exercises and all. I took one star off since finding what I need isn't always as easy as I'd like.
