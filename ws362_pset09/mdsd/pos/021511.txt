I'm 17 and have lived in a small town all my life, although my town is a little less depressing than the community of Thalia.  The theme of this book is the trappings of small towns, the loneliness of them, and the bittersweetness of youth, which I could relate to all too well.  I had not read McMurtry before, but was instantly smitten by the 50's setting and the author's excellent characterization.  The book reads swiftly, thanks to the compelling characters (and their many love affairs), who are likeable but still recognizably flawed, yearning for what they can't have, and settling to get what they can.

This is not your typical coming-of-age novel.  It is a beautifully crafted work of Southern lit that I think even a city-dweller could relate to; although it is predominantly about being stuck in Thalia, it's also about feeling so lost in a place you know so well.  My first McMurtry novel to read is now one of my favorite books
