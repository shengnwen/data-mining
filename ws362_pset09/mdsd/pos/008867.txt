I am growing more and more sympathetic to the Anabaptist movement, thanks in large part to this book, which I have continually come back to read as a primary reference. Simons represented the best in Anabaptist thought, matched only by Balthazar Hubmaier, the movement's other major theologian.

I would recommend Simons' Complete Writings for a simple reason. Some writers have a timeless quality about their work. Though they may have written during a time and context completely different from our own, somehow their 'voice' or message seems as contemporary and as relevant as things written in our own day. If you ever read something by Augustine, such as his confessions, you may understand what I'm talking about. Its the same with Simons. When I read him, I am not painfully aware that he wrote almost 500 years ago. Rather, I feel like I am in dialogue with a contemporary theologian. In this expansive work, the relevance of what Simons writes varies, but on the whole, the work is remarkably lucid.

At a time in history when the Christian right in America (with whom I identify at least in part) is progressively taking on a Constantinian form of Christendom (which I do not identify with), and seems to endlessly embark on belligerant crusades across the globe, Simons' message of a non-violent, communal, self-denying faith in Christ, is desperately needed
