Nancy Snow's modest little booklet points to an important strand in corporate America's thrust for global power: The take-over of the United States Information Agency. A propaganda organ of government since its WWI inception, the USIA now sells the Fortune 500 agenda to reluctant foreigners at tax payer expense. And here I thought only the bad old soviets made government an arm of the economy. Snow, a former employee of the agency, details this transition from cold war asset to America's neo-liberal mouthpiece to the world. Given big money's recent take-over of the Democrat party and other citizen institutions, Snow's revelation may not surprise most readers. Nevertheless, the details make informative reading, and while I would have preferred a more muckraking approach, her academic restraint undercores a deep disillusion, as reflected in her 7-Point Plan for Citizen-Based Diplomacy. The latter aims at challenging corporate dominance with citizen action and people priorities. Coming from a former insider, this speaks volumes. One hopes the message will resonate
