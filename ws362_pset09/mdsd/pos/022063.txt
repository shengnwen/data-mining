Being an animal lover, a volunteer dog walker at our local shelter and a cat owner, I always read non-fiction books relating to animals and Amazing Gracie will be one of my favorites that I will remember.  The author's writing made it so I didn't want to put the book down, it made me laugh, cry, and educated about adopting an all natural diet for our pets.  It prompted me to purchase the other three books about "Three Dog Bakery" to learn more and as I already knew, people who love animals can make wonderful things happen in their lives as well as their pets.  Now we need a "Three Dog Bakery" in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
