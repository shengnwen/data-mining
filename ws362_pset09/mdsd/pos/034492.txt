I bought this book yesterday morning and began reading it on my subway ride home.  The people around me probably thought I was crazy because I could not stop laughing.  It was so good that all I did the whole day was read it (even though it's the size of a college text book).  The book is funny, filled with great ideas, and definitely worth the money.  A great gift for anyone who likes to throw parties or cook
