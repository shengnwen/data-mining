The obvious question is "Why didn't I think of this first?"  I guess the answer to that question is my lack of hubris to ask a publisher for a $50,000 advance to go casino hopping for a month.   However, one lucky author did ask and subsequently produce a very engaging work describing the people, the casinos, and the city of Las Vegas.  

As I booked my next trip to Las Vegas (this time for New Year's Eve), my next moves were, in this order, purchasing the newest edition of Bob Sehlinger's indispensable Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas and picking up this book for a re-read.  As with the first reading, this book is hard to put down.  You truly become involved in the work, cheering on the author during his gambling escapades, feeling empathy for the characters he meets, and trying to conjure up mental pictures of the experience.  

Unfortunately, due to the fast growth and pace of Las Vegas, the book is dated.  In a way, Chapter 2 doesn't exist anymore, as it's setting, the Desert Inn, was imploded October 23, 2001.  His trip was before some of the Strip's defining megaresorts (Bellagio, Venetian, Mandalay Bay) were opened.  (He does include a postscript about attending the opening weekend of the Bellagio.)  An updated version is out of the question, as the book depends so much on the twist that he is making is very first pilgrimage to the city.

Therefore, the years have moved my current rating of this book from five to four stars.  The book was written in a speculative time in the city's history, immediately before the rush of the forementioned megaresorts onto the scene, and Martinez reflects this uncertainty through open-ended writing.  However, we now know the answers to his questions, leaving this work on the brink of irrelevancy.  Nonetheless as the years pass, this book will be an interesting description of a moment in the city's history, even as more chapters of the book are imploded.
