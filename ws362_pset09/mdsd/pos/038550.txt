This is a useful book, full of scope and sway, but marred in my reading by being written (too uncritically) from within the techno-euphoria and liberal pieties of American Studies confirming what is so exceptional and  blessed about being American.  As such, it is a book more about American  pastoral (a la Leo Marx) than about the traumas and will to imperial and  global domination of the sublime but David Nye is too much of a devoted  Marxian and Americanist to realize this is so.  Anyway, read it and be  amazed a la Whitman or Kerouac, dear reader, at the Broadway lights and the  Hoover Dam
