This is the *best* NT Greek dictionary for students of the Greek New Testament.  Thorough scholarship; many entries exhaustively categorize word meanings and all provide references to other ancient literature.  A necessity for doing scholarly work in the New Testament, and a serious reference tool for the pastor or student.  If you do any work in the NT, you *need* this lexicon.  The 3rd edition revamps the earlier glosses and attempts to provide definitions for words.  Also has words from the Apostolic Fathers and other early literature.

However, the price is VERY STEEP.  Especially for students.  If you are a student on a tight budget (and don't need to purchase the latest and greatest copy of Bauer), I would recommend doing obtaining a used copy of the 1st edition, which can be found for under $30 at the time of this writing.  The glosses are basically the same in 1st and 2nd edition, the only thing that is changed are that more mistakes are corrected.  The 3rd edition's definitions are nice, but in general I find it is more helpful to get glosses to point me in the right direction and use a concordance/search program to get a better understanding of how a word is used in the NT
