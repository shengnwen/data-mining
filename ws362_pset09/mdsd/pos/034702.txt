I don't know why I never knew about A Confederacy of Dunces when it was first published. But I just listened to it as an audiobook, and it was one of the most enjoyable books I've experienced in years.  The book is an impressive character study and commentary on New Orleans and the world in general in the early 1960's. Everyone of the characters in this story is so lifelike and beautifully crafted so that you feel these are people you know, not just characters in a book. The dialogue is pure genius.

The protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is hilarious as the big, intellectual slob who is always criticizing and pontificating at everyone from his mother to the people who are trying to buy hot dogs from him on the street. The Jones character is superb:  the super-wise and wisecracking, cynical down-and-out black man.  I loved them all:  Ignatius, his mother Irene, Mr. and Mrs. Levy, Patrolman Mancuso, Lana Lee, Darlene, Miss Annie.  Well, maybe not Myrna Minkoff and Miss Trixie so much.  But they all had a role to play. I simply didn't want the book to end; it was like losing your new-found friends.

This is a book you don't want to miss.  Read it or better yet, buy it as the audiobook read by Barrett Whitener. You are in for a rare treat
