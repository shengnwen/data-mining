I first read this in high school, in a single afternoon in a friend's car in the school parking lot. I loved it then and it's as good as I remember it. Knowles was a first-rate writer; he chose interesting subjects and fully developed his characters, and his command of the English language was second to no one. I recommend this book to everyone who loves to read good writing
