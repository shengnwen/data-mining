Lewis' work audaciously attempts to conquer the issues surrounding the most touchy subject of pain.  His boldness pays off, as he presents a clear view of the place of pain with respect to God and man.

The greatest strength in this work is the fact that it addresses the place of pain with respect to God first.  It discusses those attributes of God such as goodness and omnipotence in such a way that they are ultimately related to the question of the nature and end of pain.  This foundation provides a stable foundation for considering the fall and turnaround of redemption with respect to pain in the world and its relationship to Heaven and Hell.

Lewis is well versed in philosophy and theology and presents his considerations in an accessible but also academic fashion.  While I have a few qualms about some of his conclusions, they are not enough to utterly "rock the boat" and tip his arguments overboard.  There are a few minor points with respect to the character of man as a relational being and the implications thereof for the subject at hand.  Nonetheless, I highly suggest this text
