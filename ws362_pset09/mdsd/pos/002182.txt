I was expecting a real blockbuster ending to this series, and I was a bit disappointed. I thought the killers would turn out to be people way more involved in the series, and I was disappointed that they were really fringe characters. I felt let down by that.

Still, you can't go wrong with a Mariah Stewart book. She's one of the best out there when it comes to keeping you rivited.
