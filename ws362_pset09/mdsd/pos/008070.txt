are you serious? If you think just because a book is depressing it's not worthwhile reading, you are a complete idiot. Haven't you read any literature of value? If you have, then you would have known that almost all valuable and worthwhile books are not happy-go-lucky. I'm sorry, but the world isn't a perfect place and literature should not aim to make you think that it is. This book is a realistic depiction of what some people's lives actually are, and if you can't somehow deal with the fact that some people's lives are depressing and dissapointing then I feel sorry for you.

Anyway...this book is absolutely wonderful, I read it years ago and I can still remember some of the smallest details from the book. I'm actually shocked that a man wrote it, because it displays a female character that seems as though it would be impossible to create her without being a female. But anyways, this book is great, an easy read, but emotionally valuable.
