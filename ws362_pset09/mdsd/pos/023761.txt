If you are a Troy Taylor fan, you'll love this book!  As usual, Mr. Taylor is thorough and entertaining (but unfortunately also as usual, editing is poor, with too many spelling, grammar, and typo errors).  This is still a great telling of an unusual story that ranks right up there with the Winchester House and Resurrection Mary in America's history of mystery, and I give it 5 stars
