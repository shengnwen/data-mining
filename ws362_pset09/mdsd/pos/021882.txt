I found this book to be captivating.  This book tells a fictional story centered around Ali, Nino, and their families and friends during a period of war.  The story is captivating because of the cultural, moral, and religious questions it poses as the characters struggle with their individual feelings of right, wrong and acceptable in the times of war and peace and in the context of love and religion.  If you can accept the few historical and religious inaccuracies and focus on the lives and challenges of the people, you will appreciate this book.
