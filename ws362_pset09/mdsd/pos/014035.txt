This is the first book I read by Tess Gerritsen and after finishing it, I started looking for more.  Although the final resolution was pretty obvious with a hundred pages to go, it still kept my interest and did not slow down at all.  Ms. Gerritsen generally does a good job creating characters that the reader actually cares about one way or the other and this book is no different.  I won't spoil it by saying too much about the fates of the people in the space station, but...wow...'I feel your pain.'   Great book
