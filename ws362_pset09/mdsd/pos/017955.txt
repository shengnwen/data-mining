I can never get my fill of Nicholas Basbanes.  His love of books, libraries, and reading echo so many of my own traits, making his books treats that will bear innumberable rereadings and savorings.

Every Book Its Reader continues Basbanes' familiar theme of the continuing importance of the printed word in today's society.  It expands it by focussing on studies of the libraries of eminent booklovers of the past such as Edward Gibbon and through interviews with great living writers/readers like David McCullough and Harold Bloom. Basbanes branches into fascinating discussions on the art of translation, for example, that illuminate obscure but valuable corners of the world of books.

In other words, there is a wealth of information about books and reading in Every Book Its Reader, but the most important reason to read it is its evocation of the joy of reading. Basbanes and his readers will undoubtedly echo the sentiment of May Lamberton Becker, one of his subjects in Every Book Its Reader, in saying that if we get to heaven, we will meet each other in the corner by the bookcases.
