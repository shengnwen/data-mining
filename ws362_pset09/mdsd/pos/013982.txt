Kiron once known as the serf named Vetch was a captured peasant in the land of Tia, which was at war for years with his native Alta.  He was Ari's dragon boy and stole a dragon's egg, caring for it until it hatched and then when it was grown enough he flew it to Alta where he taught the dragon riders how to bind their dragons to them with love not drugs.  The Magi, an evil group of priests, were responsible for the war and the deaths that ensued in their quest to become the rulers of both lands. Kiron placed a significant role in defeating them.

The dragons and their Jousters, the king and queen of Alta and Tia, and some others fled their destroyed land and moved into the city of Sanctuary, located in the desert.  In time more and more people showed up so they the Jousters and their dragons were forced to move to the stone caved up of Aerie.  Lord Kiron is the de facto ruler of the Jousters and he realizes that with the war at an end and the two kingdoms about to become one the Jousters will act more like a police force than an army.  However, in a border town all the inhabitants disappear and through the use of magic it is discovered that an old and ancient enemy is preparing to war against the two lands.  Only the gods can stop them if they choose to interfere with the Jousters taking up a vanguard position against the Nameless Ones.

This is the fourth and probably the last book of the Dragon Jousters and readers have seen how Kiron has changed and grown into his power through the strength of his personality and his great leadership abilities.  This is an exciting saga that shows prejudice can be overcome when former enemies work together for the common good.  Mercedes Lackey has a unique voice and an ability to write tales that readers want to read.
