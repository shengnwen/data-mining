  I've read the big bio and it was very good.  Cherkovski really liked Buk and Malone does too.  His new bio, while it has very little new in it as far as facts are concerned, has Malone and that's new!  There are some passages near the end that rival Bukowski himself.  Malone is a fine prose poet.
  The one thing that bothers me about all the material by and about Bukowski, and that includes this book, is that they don't show the normal every day relationship between Buk and his parents, between Buk and his girls, between Buk and his friends.   You can't be used and abused all the time.  People go crazy but they don't stay there.  One time Mr. Bukowski put his son into a special class.  And one must always remember that the very existence of children are a reminder of their parents mortality and that can drive anyone a little over the edge.
  If you are interested in Bukowski read this book
