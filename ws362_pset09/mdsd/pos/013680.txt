The world-known Men-At-Arms series brought out another interesting book. This time dealing with the uniforms of the German army at the Eastern Front '43-45.  As to be expected the text is brief but quite informative.  But .  as usual, the main attractions are the beautifull rendered colour plates by  Mr Syephen Andrew who is getting better than Mr. Ron Volstadt. This book  can be recommended to every modeller and  historien who takes interest in  this timeframe or  uniforms in general. I am hoping that Mr. Andrew will be  Osprey's artist of choice in the future
