I finally found the the words I needed to tell a friend in this book - &quot;...Like most Japanese products, Honda motorcycles offered perfect function but no passion.&quot;  That clearly describes the difference  between those of us on scoots and the wannabe racers on rice rockets.   Brock brings his awesome powers of observation and ability to get the facts  straight to this book, and leaves no doubt in any readers mind of the bad,  the good and the VERY ugly in the story of an American icon -  Harley-Davidson Motorcycles.  If you are a true student of the marque as  well as a business buff, this is a must-read on both counts
