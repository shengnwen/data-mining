Having lived a half block from one of the Philly shops while going to school, I was thrilled when I saw this book on their shelf one Christmas.  I immediately bought it and took it home, knowing that when I left town, it would help with my craving for their perfect danish.  Like another reviewer, one of the first recipes that I tried was the oatmeal cookie.  What a disappointment.  The cookie is overly sweet and bakes crisp, not thick and soft with a crunchy exterior like the cookie sold in the bakery.  Fortunately, that is the only recipe that I tried that doesn't come out well.  The sourdough starter works beautifully and the country wheat loaf is superb.  I only wish that the authors had included both weights and volumes as any bread baker knows, weights tend towards the more accurate measure.  I even tried the danish one fateful day, and once they came out of the over, I was transported back to Philly, sitting in the park and discussing life with friends early in the morning before class.  
    I conclusion, I really enjoy this cookbook and with some minor improvements in a second addition (weights, tune up the oatmeal cookie, include the "metro" cookie) it would easily be the book I reach for most frequently
