This book will probably interest people already curious about the subject but will be a harder sell to the average educated reader perusing library shelves and on-line catalogs for an appealing general history.  

Yet Measuring America is indeed a good general history, decently (if discursively) written, with good arguments made throughout. (David McCullough blurbs that he "was caught up from the first page.")  Perhaps the subtitle's claim that land surveys "fulfilled the promise of democracy" is a bit over the top, but Linklater does correctly associate increased private ownership of real estate with the rise of democracy and the dramatic increase in population of the Thirteen Colonies that allowed them to outstrip New France and New Spain.  Linklater also shares some clever thoughts about the strengths and weaknesses of farms and city blocks turned into squares and rectangles.

Actually, Measuring America deals as much with weights and smaller linear measures as with the rectangular survey that turned the Midwest into grids stretching to the horizon from twenty thousand feet.  Some of the most interesting chapters treat the possible window of opportunity during the early national years that might have permitted the United States to adopt a decimal measuring system superior to metric, which then might have taken the place of the latter as an international standard.
