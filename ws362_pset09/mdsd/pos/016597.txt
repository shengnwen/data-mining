For anyone who wants to learn how to prove theorems, this is a great book. This author takes the time and space needed to explain
and illustrate the points being made. He also gives the historical context for the work being discussed. In general a nice alternative to the 'get down to business' approach used by most authors that write about mathematical proofs
