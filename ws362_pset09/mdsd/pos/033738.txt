If you've been following the Stephanie Plum series, you'll probably be pleased to know that the principal characters haven't changed a bit.

What has changed is the level of danger involved and this time Stephanie has managed to get herself on the hit list of a killer linked to a violent gang.  Both Morelli and Ranger want to keep her under lock and key, but neither handcuffs nor stun guns can keep a good hard headed girl down.

Add in a cross-dressing foul-mouthed bus driver, the usual exploding car, and her sister's upcoming wedding, and you get a delightful mix of madness that only Janet Evanovich can deliver.

Fast paced and wickedly funny.
