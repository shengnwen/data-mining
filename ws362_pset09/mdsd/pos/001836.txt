"Beautiful Losers" merges the profane with the sacred to create an unforgettable, disturbing and wildly elated vision.  Using masterful stream-of-consciousness, Leonard Cohen breaks the barriers:  nothing is off-limits, nothing is too precious, nothing is too spiritual.  Everything, including all forms of erotic acts, will be desecrated on these pages:  but none of the writing is gratuitous.  With every blasphemous thought and image, we are drawn into an ecstatic spiritual quest, such that in the midst of an insanely orgasmic scene, replete with blood, violence, debilitating pleasure, we find this treasure:

("O Father, Nameless and Free of Description, lead me from the Desert of the Possible.  Too long I have dealt with Events.  Too long I labored to become an Angel.  I chased Miracles with a bag of Power to salt their wild Tails.  I tried to dominate Insanity so I could steal its Information.  I tried to program the Computers with Insanity.  I tried to create Grace to prove that Grace e isted. ... We could not see Evidence stretched our Memories.  Dear Father, accept this confession:  we did not train ourselves to Receive because we believed there wasn't Anything to Receive and we could not endure with this Belief.")

At the center of the novel is the unforgettable "F", the great iconoclast, the sexualist searching for the divine experience, the man who betrays with joy, who gives and receives pain with bliss, who howls out his darkness in a search for light.

Readers who relate to "Beautiful Losers" may also be open to "Miss MacIntosh My Darling", "Art and Lies", and (of course) Satre's "No Exit."  Still, to see such roaring poetry and prose bundled into a novel is rare, and "Beautiful Losers" is one-of-a-kind.
