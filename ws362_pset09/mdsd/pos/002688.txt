I have seen John Edward's confidence in person, so wanted to know more about him. I am Catholic and learned a lot more about the mental aspect of saying the rosary. I learned about how you can think about your prayer energy as a laser beam that you can aim at peace in the Middle East or toward a loved one. I am going to try to picture myself in an empty church while praying and ask for abundance. He says if you achieve betterment in areas of your life and you put passion in your life, profession and direction, then profit will be achieved in many areas. I like how he describes prayer: as a plea or call to God for help, assistance or guidance. It rejuvenates and puts you in touch with your maker. It assesses the will of God, praises God, gives thanks to God, repents, asks forgiveness, seeks a favor.
