Bernard McGinn's new book comes as no surprise:  as usual it is an excellent, scholarly presentation of the subject at hand, and with Eckhart as the subject, the reader is in good hands with McGinn.  This books started off as a continuation of McGinn's history of Western mysticism, but ended up being a monograph on Eckhart.  Mcginn's familiarity with the sources, his use of both the Latin and German works of Eckhart, and his detailed knowledge of the secondary literature in German, French, and English will make this the standard English-language reference book on Eckhart's mystical philosophy for years to come.  Any serious student of Western mysticism should alerted that this is an important work. My only regret is that McGinn does not deal with the Eckhart-beguine connection much at all.  Perhaps when this book is revised and condensed to form part of the next volume in his history of mysticism series, this aspect will be also be considered
