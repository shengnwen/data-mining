This is definitely a book about squeezing the last penny out of your dollar.  It is far beyond the typical "clip coupons" and "buy what you can in bulk" mentality.  The author actually advises against most coupon shopping (buy the store brands when you can, they are cheaper than discounted national brands in many/most cases).  I can honestly say I am a pretty good bargain shopper, but I got my money's worth in reading this book.  There is a lot of information in this book that is obvious after reading about it, but not as obvious before it is pointed out.

On the other hand, I thought the book went a little beyond what I would be willing to do.  I'm all for stocking my kitchen so that I don't have to purchase items until they are on sale/priced to my liking, but building shelves and hiding them behind curtains in a baby's room or artifically raising the bed to fit more food under it seem extreme
