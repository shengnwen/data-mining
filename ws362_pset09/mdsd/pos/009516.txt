This light-hearted and entertaining book is perfect for readers who are beginning their walk with Christ, and for those who are not yet "saved" but sense a God-shaped hole in their hearts. True Christians can feel comfortable sharing "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About God (but were afraid to ask)" with fellow believers, and with those in their mission field.

Of course, Metaxas does not offer all of the answers here -- and there are many, many more questions. I, for one, hope more volumes will come, and more people will find themselves gently led to Jesus, thanks to Eric Metaxas. Bravo, brother
