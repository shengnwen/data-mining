Wow is all I can say. Feist did it again. He keeps the book so intresting that you can't stop turning the pages until you are done. This book had one of the best and most touching endings of all the books so far (Talons ending). 

The new characters where once again outstanding. Everytime I find out the books are about new characters I'm kind of bummed because I like the other characters so much and want to hear more about them. As I read on in the new books I find I come to like the new characters just as much and want to hear more about them. Its really a vicious cycle. I have come to enjoy all of Feists main characters, Pug, Thomas, Borric, Arutha, Nicholas, Erland, Nakor, James, Eric, Roo, Dashle, Jimmy, Talon, and the list goes on and just keeps being added to.

Bravo Feist. I look forward to more.
