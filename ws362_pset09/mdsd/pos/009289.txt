We used this book in my building construction class i took as a second year architecture student. The book is good for people who are learning the basics of how things work, are put together, what types of materials are used for different situations, etc. However if you are looking for detailed drawings, I would go elsewhere. The book is good for generalized explanations, so I did learn a lot from it
