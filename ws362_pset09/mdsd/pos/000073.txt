It seems there are a lot of people who think they can write an authoritative book on the art of writing.  It is always a wonderful surprise to find one that actually knows what they are talking about and can convey their expertise is a clear and concise manner.  Author Paula LaRocque is one of those few and shares her knowledge in her book &quot;The Book on Writing: The Ultimate Guide to Writing Well&quot;.  She divides the book up into three sections - A Dozen Guidelines to Good Writing, Storytelling, and Language and Writing Mechanics.  Through the use of illustrative texts both before revision and afterwards she clearly illustrates each item as she discusses it.  This is one of the best books on writing and should be read by anyone wanting to move their writing up to the next level
