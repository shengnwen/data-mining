The Semantic Web and knowledge management converge in this book by Dieter Fensel. Ontologies, a term from philosophy referring to the types and classifications of things that exist, recently has become a term of art in the area of business technology design. This book systematically introduces the idea of ontologies and shows clearly and in detail how to apply this conceptual framework for enhanced Internet-based e-commerce and improved Intranet retrieval of corporate information and knowledge. The notion of ontologies first gained acceptance outside philosophical circles among those working on the Semantic Web as a means to enable agents to reason about Web content and provide sensible responses to unanticipated situations. Fensel provides a thorough survey of a range of ontology-based knowledge representation techniques in terms of their applicability to Web-based information exchange. While the first part of the book will be accessible to non-experts interest in the use of ontologies in e-commerce and knowledge management, the second part presents a more technical view on emerging Web standards
