Overall the dictionary was fine. It was thorough enough to have many of the more esoteric theoretical terminology for translation. It is quite large and heavy, making it difficult to use at times. On the other hand it was limited in some of the jargon used by my particular scientific discipline, but then I know of any dictionary that does any better
