This was my first Tim O'Brien novel.  I agree with the other reviews that have characterized this more as a series of interrelated short stories.  For some reason these characters and O'Brien's style reminds me of Raymond Carver.  I found the beginning of the book challenging because the reader is quickly introduced to so many characters.  The strength of the book lies in how O'Brien introduces the characters and their interwoven stories throughout the remainder of the book.  My one criticism is the book's premise that so many of these central characters would be so consumed with events that occurred 30 years ago.  I struggled to accept that none of them had moved on.  But this problem didn't take away from the great writing
