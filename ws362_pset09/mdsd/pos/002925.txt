I read the book with amazement.  I thought it both profound in the efforts to grapple with the end of the Cold War and the lengths that were taken to deal with international crisises.  I don't care about the prose or style -  it was wonderful to get my hands on a book that gave me a more concrete  insights and level headed practicality in foreign policy rahter than that  foreign policy in more recent times.  Brent Scowcroft and Georege H. W.  Bush lead the world through interesting and troubled times and helped us  establish the United States as the preminent global power.  It's a good  read if you are interested in the shaping of foreign policy at the very  top
