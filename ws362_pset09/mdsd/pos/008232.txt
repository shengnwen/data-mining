This new book by Beryl Markham is a jewel of a read for any mixed media fabric/paper artist!  Her creations are exquisite, delicate evocations of a heavenly world where everything is as perfectly beautiful as it is possible to make it.  I am convinced that angels helped her with some of these artworks.  There is a sense of patience, time, and  careful, meticulous working in her pieces. In fact, these qualities are so exemplified, it can be exhausting to go through this book at one sitting!  I found myself thinking: " How long for that project?  Six months?"  But I make this comment only to indicate the high quality and intricacy of the work. It is the her artistic imagination that is spellbinding.  As a weaver and embroiderer and book maker, I could find countless applications for her ideas and techniques. Many craft books these days seem to be repetitive and thin, but this one is rich beyond words--Markham has done a substantial body of work for this book and it is extraordinarily beautiful.  She is a mature artist who has mastered a broad range of techniques and used them to support a unique and shimmering vision, that while decorative, is also just plain stunning
