a difficult book to read, stylistically speaking. the sentences are awkward, and 300 pages later i couldn't adapt to the point that they  smoothed out. chapters 2-5, roughly 100 pages, seemed particularly viscous.  i went through the entire book without feeling that i really knew what the  author meant by the term &quot;daimonic.&quot; there's a footnote from the  intro that gives a hint, another hint on page 65, but after going through  it a third time the best i can do is work backward from terms from freud  and jung. diamond provides reasonably informative and entertaining  overviews of noted theorists and brief biographies of creative artists. the  most welcome line of the book for me was a quote from rollo may: &quot;the  task of the therapist is to conjure up the devils rather than put them to  sleep.&quot; no devils, and few other readers, will be particularly stirred  up by the book, i'm afraid, but i give it a four for the revelation that  western thinkers have arrived at &quot;confrontation therapy&quot; mere  thousands of years after the orient (a zen master shoved his non-swimming  student into a deep pond. as the student thrashed, the master calmly asked,  &quot;at this moment, what is your original mind?&quot;)
