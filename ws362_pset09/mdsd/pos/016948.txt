Much of this book takes place in a fictionalised version of the American Museum of Natural History and was inspired by a nocturnal visit of that establishment undertaken by the two authors who both felt the venue-in particular its dinosaur hall -would be an ideal setting for a thriller .They were right -and this ,their debut novel -still holds up as a fun ride .
The curators of the museum are getting ready to open a prestigious new exhibition whose theme is Superstition and whose centrepiece is a statue of the God Mbuen ,a creature half human and half reptile .The icon has been transferred from the Amazon River region and right from the word go its disinterrment has been followed by a series of gruesome deaths .The victims have not merely been killled -they have been eviscerated and otherwise severely mutilated including two victims discovered in the labyrinthine tunnels under the museum itself .The killer leaves behind DNA which blends human and the lizard strains 
The museum curators ignore advice to delay the opening of the exhibition while the deaths are investigated as to do so would result in monetary crisis  --the echoes of "Jaws " are clear .

The hunters are a disparate group-there is Margo Green ,the doctoral student and her adviser Dr Frock ,an FBI man named Pendergast ,a crime reporter Bill Smithback and a veteran cop Vincent D'Agosta .On the night of the exhibition opening the killer strikes again and the party hunts him down through the catacombs under the museum 
The characters are briefly but vividly etched and the book build to an atmospheric and gripping climax .The eerie settings add impact and the authors do a masterly job of interpolating useful chunks of academic erudition among the gore .
Its an enjoyable book and still for my money the best this team have written .Unreservedly recommended -unless you dont like gory books in which case it is best avoided
