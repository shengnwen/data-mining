The book is very good, unquestionably. It provides you with a deep understanding of interest rate models and risk management. Mind you, you need to know the basics of bonds and fixed income contongent claims, before you try this book. The examples are apt, and explanations are succint, and easily understood. The mathematics involved can be mastered easily, and no arcane stuff (like measure-theoretic probability etc.) are used. So, the book will be accessible to MBA students too. This book has helped me understand the subject very well
