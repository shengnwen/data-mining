     In a word, WOW.  This book is ranked in the top five greatest books that I've ever read.  Clancy uses incredibly specific and intricate descriptions of the nautical military to create a real life atmosphere that the reader can relate to.  Real military events were used to shape the plot of the story, and Amazon.com even states that Clancy was rumored to have been debriefed by the White House during the production of this novel.
     
     Clancy also creates an easy way for the reader to understand the complexity of the characters.  He uses events from his own life to shape the personality of Jack Ryan, the main character.  With character traits that were founded on the experiences of a real-life person, the reader is able to relate to Jack Ryan as if he was a member of reality.
     
     Finally, the theme presented in this book can teach the everyday consumer a very valuable lesson - never jump to conclusions.  As Jack Ryan's actions are carried out during the story, he constantly gives a base for this moral to grow off of.  By reading and learning the depths of Jack Ryan's personality,  we as a society can learn to live by this theme, and greatly enhance our everyday lives
