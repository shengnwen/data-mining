A nice story of the scientist who came to a similar conclusion about natural history as his elder and more famous colleague, Darwin.  I enjoyed reading about Wallace's background (quite different than Darwin's), his world travels, and the ways in which his theories differed from Darwin's.  The author uses multivariate analysis on personality traits to attempt to explain some of these differences; I'm not fully convinced of the validity of that (for every statistical rule there are exceptions, and as Mark Twain colorfully observed, &quot;there are lies ...&quot;), but it's an interesting possibility
