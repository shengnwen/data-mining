"Beyond the Down Low" by Keith Boykin is a great accumulation of background information on the topics of blacks, gays, HIV and AIDS, and their interdependence in American society. As Keith Boykin has seen and achieved a great number of things in his life, he can provide an expert look at facts from different perspectives.

From the way Boykin writes, the text sounds like an arguement and as if he was trying to prove a point. However, I don't feel it is clearly stated what that point is. That was a bit confusing. Maybe it is just Boykin's enthusiastic and passionate writing style. 
Nevertheless, this is a book worth reading for a broad spectrum of audiences. The amount of information he provides really educates the reader and lets him or her make his or her own judgement of the so-called down low. With "Beyond the Down Low," Keith Boykin sheds some much needed light on the situation of black gays within their communities
