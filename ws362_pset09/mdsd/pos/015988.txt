This was the kind of book that you never want to end. I tried to read it slow... reread paragraphs over and over to fully absorb the beautiful writing. To step back in time and read what was done to young girls at a time they should be enjoying the joys of childhood, was a shock and yet you couldn't turn your eyes away. The timeline goes from the young years of two girls lives and their trials along the way. How the families pared them up with just as much attention they would be getting someday when they are getting married. It takes them far into their old age, and what happens at the end of their lives. I won't spoil it for you... just read it... and pass it on to your friends. Beautiful book.
