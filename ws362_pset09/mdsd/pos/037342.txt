Two of my professors recommended (A IS for Alibi" and "B is for Burglar") the books in Sue Grafton's series for their sharp swift reading style and mystery entertainment. "F is for Fugitive" is my family's latest treasure. Each mystery is 
entertaining, not formula stuff. Guaranteed to please even
our most picky fans here
