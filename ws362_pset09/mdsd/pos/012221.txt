Adkisson and Riser are beacons in the darkness that is labeled asset protection. This book, and the attitudes it sets forth towards asset protection (when that term may be discretely used) are the de facto standard of care and woe be to the professional who believes otherwise. I say there are no surprises because the book is the embodiment of the professional, real life anti-scam viewpoint in this area Jay Adkisson has come to represent. Do not ignore the fact most of these five star reviews are by attorneys like myself who see the aftermath of so-called asset protection, off-shore entities and third world trusts. Don't miss it
