This is an important book, because it brings to light a very important sociologic/economic trend. I found the section on job volatility very pertinent (I'm a programmer). My only caveat is that many collectivist/socialist countries have problems equal to or worse than ours. Some of them are even trying to emulate us and add more capitalistic elements into their societies. (I grew up in England and am familiar with the problems in France and Germany). I guess that's why economics is called the "Dismal Science"
