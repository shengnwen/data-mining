In my opinion, this book started out really slow. In fact, I put this book aside after reading around forty pages and then picked it up again a few weeks later, determined to finish. 

When I did pick it up again, though, I was quickly intrigued and I finished it in less than a day. Still, in my opinion it was only worthy of four stars. It seemed kind of far-fetched, and even though that is part of what I respect about Meg Cabot I thought that it could have been better
