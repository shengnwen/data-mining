On a recent trip to Washington, I packed this book, my only field guide,  in my carry on flight bag.  It worked beautifully!  As an easterner there  are a lot of plants and animals in the Pacific Northwest that I am not  familar with, but this book helped me on numerous occasions.  I was never  in an environment like the Columbia Plateau before and all around me were  these two plants that dominated the landscape. Having no idea what species  they where, I opened the book and immediately found Big Sagebush and Gray  Rabbitbush, side by side, just as they were growing.  I was able to  determine that the Chickadee over my head at another time was not the  Black-Capped I was fimilar with but rather the Chestnut-Backed, a new  species for me.  The part on Parks and Preserves was also very helpful,  especially when used in connection with other tour books. With the increase  restrictions on airline carry-ons this is the one book to take with you.   It is all encompassing from Geology, Habitats, Weather (cloud watching from  the plane window) through Flora and Faunna to Parks and Preserves.  A very  good idea presented in a very useable format
