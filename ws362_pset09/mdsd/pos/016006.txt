Reliquary
Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child


	This is the sequel to the New York Times best seller Relic. And this too, made me think twice about the sounds that go bump in the night. And what it's really like in the uncharted tunnels underneath NYC.
	Again Margo, Dr. Frock, Pendergast, D'Agosta, and Greg and a new cast in the characters, Hayward and captain Waxie, are caught up in an enthralling adventure through the tunnels in New York. That are uncharted and hold the mole people, who have brought to the attention of the cops that there are things living in the deeper sections of the tunnels that are unnatural. These things are killing the moles and eating their brains.
	I would have to say that my favorite character in this book is Margo Green. I liked her because of her smarts and wit. She knew what to do and when to do it, and ultimately she's the one who saved the day.
	I thought that this book was just as good as the first and the ending will just absolutely blow your mind. I thought that the plot of it was well written and very well planned out. And the motive was exceptional.
