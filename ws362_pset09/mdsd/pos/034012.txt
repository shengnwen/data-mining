I blasted her when she wrote The Apprentice and hated the Jane Rizzoli character. In Body Double however, I found the twosome of Maura and Jane a good match. This was a quick read, lots of twists and turns and a surprise ending that I thought was rather quirky and fun.
This is a good read, not a great one. Tess does terror and suspense with a flair. I am happy that I gave this author another go
