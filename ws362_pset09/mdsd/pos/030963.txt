For fans of DS9, this is a must! It continues the story seamlessly and you feel as if you are transported back to the Station with all the characters. You can actually visualize what would be happening, even with new scenes and characters. I couldn't put it down once I started. Glad I bought the second volume so I wouldn't have to wait to finish the episode. Looking forward to the next installment
