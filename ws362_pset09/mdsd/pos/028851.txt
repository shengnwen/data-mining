I am in the process of converting to Catholicism after being raised Presbyterian.  I found this book not only to be an easy-to-read and understand explanation of the basics of Catholic catechism, but an outstanding reminder of what Christianity means, should stand for and should strive to be.

The topics are in depth, and there are subtle references to refute fundamentalist arguments often heard in 21st century America.

I enjoyed this book and would recommend it
