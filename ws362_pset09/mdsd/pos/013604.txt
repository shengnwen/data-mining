Interface is a neat little conspiracy tale dealing with the attempt by an organization with virtually unlimited resources to take effective control of the United States.  It is, apparently, a republished edition of a very early Stephenson novel and exhibits Stephenson's wonderful gift for drawing vivid characters by way of providing an exceptionally detailed background.  Average Stephenson far surpasses the best works of most other authors.  Having just finished his over 3,000 page opus set in the Baroque era, I can state without qualification that he really is that good.  

One of my favorite characteristics of a Stephenson novel is his uncanny ability to ride right on the line of willing suspension of disbelief.  Perhaps because his characters are so excellently drawn the reader is willing to accept that, for example, neurosurgical science advances fifty years in a week or that a candidate could get away with turning a debate into a campaign advertisement.  We aren't just introduced to the protagonist, we are introduced to his great-grandparents and given a complete family history.  The introduction of our evil (well, not really evil, but that is his role) genius character takes place only after Stephenson knowledgably describes the character's monster pick-up truck and its effect upon the locals.  So, yes, the book is full of rather contrived situations and characters--but they are so exquisitely contrived that you can't put the book down.  These are characters you come to understand and care about--you find yourself hoping that they succeed.  

Finally, Stephenson has some interesting things to say about our world.  He understands at a very deep level how we are drowning in BS and trading reality for pleasant fictions that help us get along in an overly complex society that is no longer interested in where it is going or how it got there.
