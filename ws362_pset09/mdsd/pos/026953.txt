A careful reader will notice that there are two other customer reviews here: one of which written from the point of view of the philosophers, the other written from the point of view of people in the humanities. To  philosophers of course Rorty is a suspicious character, while to people in  the humanities he appears to be some sort of friend--a fellow-traveler, so  to speak. Both of these responses must drive Rorty nuts, for he would want  to point out to both of them just how stereotyped those responses are. Yet  even this response by an imagined Rorty would drive Rorty nuts, because he  has already said that that sort of response is the sort of response that  would be made by people influenced by French poststructuralism--and Rorty  has said that even THAT, now, is tired and old hat. He's right of  course--anyone with any sense has gotten out of the humanities game and is  presently getting rich in Internet start-ups.
