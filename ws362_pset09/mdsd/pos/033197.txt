I an am engineer with a few semesters of physics/chemistry background, and I found this book very difficult to understand and grasp.  Nevertheless, it was a fascinating read with very far-reaching ideas in it.  

I would say that I honestly feel that I understood about 50% of the book, the other half I just sort of read and got introduced to.  This book talks about space-time, relativity, quasars, string theory, quantum mechanics, black holes, and many other relativity and astrophysics topics.  The pictures are what makes this book.  I think I would have understood an even smaller percentage of the book had it not been for the pictures.

Bottom line - it was a fascinating read about some insights into the universe.  Recommended for any amateur or professional physics student or for anyone interested in the cosmos as explained by one of the greatest minds in contemporary physics.
