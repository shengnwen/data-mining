Lots of church growth books, seminars, 'experts' [remember an expert is  nothing but a former spurt! Ha!] are all cramming down Western  Christianity's throat that we've got to have 'contemporary music'  [so-called] and we've got to have this and that to 'reach' our postmodern  world. Webber hits the nail right on the head and brings out the  grass-roots issue many of us 'small-time' small town, small church, 'in the  trenches' pastors have known over the last 10 years of ministry, namely  that all the fads and all the hoopla, all the 'church growth' ideas will  NOT get people into church. God's way and God's Word and God's worship is  the ONLY way. Returning to our 'roots' is EXACTLY what attracts folks to  the place I minister in. Webber's form of Ancient-Future Worship does what  spiritually hungry people WANT...EXALTING Christ, EXPERIENCING  Christ...ENCOURAGING participation in Christ. I highly recommend this, even  though it is sometimes a little too 'high-brow' and I'd highly recommend  Hunter's 'Celtic Way of Evangelism' in tandam to get THE RIGHT picture of  worship and ministry that WILL reach Generation X, Generation Y and all the  others in this rapidly changing world. People want solidarity and long for  relationships and right tradition. Webber's book shows us how to do that  through the greatest exercise man is privileged to participate  in...worshiping the Triune God! Missions exists because worship  doesn't...think about it
