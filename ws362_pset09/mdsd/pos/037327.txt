I'll start by saying whats great: Dave McKean. As usual, his macabre style and collage style are the best I've seen, and he really shines in sequential-format. Pick this book up on the strength of the artwork alone and you won't be dissapointed. Its visceral and beautiful, and i can't recommend it enough.

Grant Morrison on the other hand... Where to begin? The premise is exciting, and the play between the reality of Batman's symbolic villains and their reflection in his damaged mind is fascinating. But maybe the man bit off more than he could chew. The reimaginings of the characters sometimes shine, and at other times completely confuse. a few of the characters are completely unidentifiable (clayface) or pointless (scarecrow). Batman doesn't really act like the Batman of the comicbooks, and sometimes his behaviour is completely counter to that of the established hero. However, this is a great Joker book, and his characterisation is spot-on brilliant, as is Two-face who is fascinating as a man consumed by indecision when faced with a fall range of choices when a tarot-deck replaces his coin. His final choice reveals a man whose decision making is more complex than he perhaps lets on. 

The anniversary edition contains a full script, annotated, which is an interesting read, and clarifies a lot of the confusing portions of the story itself, but in the end seems tacked on in order to fill the pages and give people a reason to re-buy the most purchased graphic novel of all time. The Dave McKean extras are nice, and new cover is gorgeous.

For those who already own the original edition, save your money and hope for a future over-sized absolute edition (fingers crossed). Everyone else, this is a fantastic art-book, and worth the cost. Not perfect, but highly recommended.
