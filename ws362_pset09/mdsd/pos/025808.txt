My children found the book helpful and enjoyed reading it.   The children have used the book to help them develop their skills, and have read the book over again on their own.
I have been pleased with the Moser series as it is an easy read book for children.  Children can understand the concepts and apply them to their every day life.  The kids gave the rating
