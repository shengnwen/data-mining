The book A Teacup full of Roses was a very good book. It a book that has a lot of good life lesson. As don't do drug and challenge your self to do the best you can do. You will never be promise the next day. You will take on an appearance of being black and challenge we face everyday. My favorite character was Davey because he was smart and very determined. I would recommend this to any looking for a book with heart and soul
