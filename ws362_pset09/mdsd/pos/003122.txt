i got my a+ a while ago all thanks to mike. here is a brief summary:

it does not matter how long you work in the field, if you want to do good on the exam, you need to read a book like this. simply some stuff on the exam you will never encounter. 

the book is outstanding on the topics of hardware. however, i felt the book was weak on the operating systems

you could pass the a+ with this book along, but you need to be using windows xp pro for a while to do that. a better way (or the mix i done) was this book and examcram2. it's a winning combo.
