I absolutely adore this book!  I read it in about four days because I just couldn't put it down!
I recommend this book to anyone that would go to the ends of the earth for love or fame.
All Neely, Jen and Anne want is love after all their fame they are lonely and they just want someone to love them unconditionally.
Valley of the Dolls is the ultimate 'love can kill you.'  Kill not necesarilly in the death sense but in other ways too.
The character of Jennifer sometimes reminded me of Marilyn Monroe and Neely sometimes reminded me of Sylvia Plath.
This is one of the few books that has ever REALLY captured me and pulled me in.  I was happy when something went right for one of the characters but towards the end I was so mad I wanted to rip the pages out.
I'm not selling this book well but it is an emotional rollercoaster.  I recommend it to anyone that has loved and lost or who has ever considered playing the fame game.
Eye opening stuff.
Wonderful!
Unstoppable
