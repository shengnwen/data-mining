I have been working this past year on all areas of helping my child and myself learn to manage anger,stress,anxiety and frustration.I am lucky to be working with a teacher that is willing to explore and take advice from authors like Elaine Whitehouse. This book takes the chaos out of anger. Adults and children learn how to recognize and deal with and express normal feelings of anger. This,coupled with the anxiety and anger management techniques from Lori Lite's "Children's Awareness Curriculum" and "Indigo Dreams" CD have been just the right combination for me and my child. The more we as a community are exposed to these books and concepts the quicker we will have a peaceful, communicative society able to resolve conflict before the volcano errupts. This should be a required class for all children and adults
