There seems to be a theme in most of the stories in Everything That Rises Must Converge, and that is sudden violence... usually at the end.  I'm not giving anything away, because the read is the important part.  O'Connor creates very authentic southern characters, that are funny, disgusting, bigoted, warm and all around human.  There seems to be a slight O'Henry in O'Connor in that she likes to surprise you... some may say suddenly end things, quite dramatically.  But it is with this ease that her writing is that much more disturbing.  On the surface, the south she portrays is gentle and simple.  Yet with sudden ferocity, she turns it on its head.  To read O'Connor is really enthralling.  The intensity and description in which she writes makes each story in this collection seem like a novel.  I read Wise Blood a few years ago and liked it, but I will have to read it again as well as her other works after the great fulfillment this collection gave me
