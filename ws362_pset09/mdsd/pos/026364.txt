The humor in this book lies not in the letters sent from Ted or the replies from the companies, but in the reader's mind, trying to imagine how long the responder must have spent trying to come up with an acceptable response to each letter. It really is interesting to see just how far an establishment is willing to bend over backwards if it means more business for them.

While repetitive and maybe a little bit dry at times, it's the perfect book to keep bedside or in the bathroom.
