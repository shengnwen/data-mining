Malamud has a way with narrative so that at the first word you are hooked and you can't put the book down till the story is over.  His prose style is smooth and transparent, and his characters are idiosyncratic.  My favorite  stories were The German Refugee, Man in the Drawer, Black Is My Favorite  Color, Zora's Noise and Rembrandt's Hat. But all of them are worthwhile
