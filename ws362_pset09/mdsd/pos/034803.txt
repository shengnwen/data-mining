Sad but interesting story.  Seems improbable that a life could be lived(ruined?)this way, but the news verifies that it happens, with varying outcomes.  I haven't had a chance to see the movie, but I feel it might be better than the book.  The Judi Dench role appears to promise more drama with sinister undertones
