I really enjoyed reading this book about the new work of dogs.  Jon Katz writes what I always see in the lives of people with dogs, but can't exactly put into words.  He does a great job of that by writing about the lives of people with dogs and how their dogs serve them.  Yes, there are actual working dogs in the world working on farms and such.  But the work he writes about in this book is more emotional, even spiritual.  It is about how we see our dogs, what we expect of them, and in turn how we treat them.  Some people in the book relied on their dogs for emotional support, companionship, unconditional love.  Others only needed them for a season of their lives, then discarded them, or didn't see their dogs as in need just as we are for just being dogs and having human companionship.  I see people like this everywhere.  Jon Katz does a fantastic job of writing about real-life examples of this new work.  Some stories are heartbreaking, while others make you smile.  It's a great book
