I can only compare my reaction to this story to wanting to turn a boat around - or seeing an accident about to happen and being powerless to do anything about it.  "Memory Keeper's" begins with such a terrible lapse in judgement - that the reader can only watch and wait for all of the life-changing experiences and disasters that will predictably result.  As one deception after another unfolds, I longed to scream, "Enough".  Tell the woman the truth, for goodness sake - who appointed you the keeper of all moral/immoral decisions?  I felt yanked back and forth - feeling sympathy, empathy, anger, frustration, and most of all, exhaustion.  If the true test of a good book is arousing all those feelings, and ignoring the pain, plunging back into the book at every opportunity,  then this is a blockbuster.  This will be a tough book to follow, but I'll be there the day Kim Edward's next one comes out
