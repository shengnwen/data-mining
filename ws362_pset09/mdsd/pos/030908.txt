Fourteenth century Italy was a maelstrom of political intrigue,military turmoil, and populated with deceiving and fascinating characters. Frances Stonor Saunders' new book uses Sir John Hawkwood, an English mercenary, as its center to create a world both thrilling and repugnant. To state that this is a book one "cannot put down" is risky, but it is nonetheless true. It is a captivating and well written account! The book moves rapidly through the era yet it does not sacrifice detail and description, but contains enough of both to hold the reader in its grasp. The character of Hawkwood is deftly interwoven into the fabric of medieval Italy. Although he was English he was a survivor. That was no mean feat as Sauders so impressively relates. It is superbly written and recommended most highly
