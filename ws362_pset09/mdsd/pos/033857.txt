Espresso Tales by Alexander McCall Smith is the type of book that restores your faith in literature.  For everyone who says that good books aren't being written anymore, send them to Smith, because everything he writes is wonderful.  Smith returns us to 44 Scotland Street to update us on the goings-ons of its denizens.  It took me a couple of chapters to remember who was who and slide back into the rhythms of their lives, but once I was there, it was nearly impossible to leave.  Poor Bertie is back with his horrible mother Irene.  Bruce has returned with his clove hairgel.  Just about everyone has returned, except the pair who hung around Big Lou's.  Smith has several surprises in store for his characters, and I don't want to give any of them away.  The writing is smooth and seamless as he moves from character to character.  If only they made movies like this, my faith would be restored in the movie industry
