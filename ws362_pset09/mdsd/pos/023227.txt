McDonnel is a comic strip genius, in my opinion.  His artistic talent combined with his wit and wisdom make for fun reading.  One thing I particularly like about this Mutts collection is the wisdom of the Shphinx strips.  I would suggest, though, that you start with the first collection of strips so you can get the full story behind Earl and Mooch and all their friends and family
