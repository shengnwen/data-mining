There really isn't a reason NOT to buy his book. The price is very reasonable and the information in it helpful. I do not only suggest this book for vegans/vegetarians, but for everyone. In fact I would suggest that more people who are *not* vegan or vegetarian read it. 

Marcus is objective in his information, and the facts are undeniable (and documented). Everyone needs to know what is going on, what is really involved in the products they are buying every single day. I really felt inspired by this book and I cite it often in conversation. It is an easy read, very informative, and is divided up nicely for quick reference.
I am sendng my parents a copy.
