This book was one that I simply could not put down until it was completed. I read it cover to cover in one day.  Senator Edwards appears to share from the heart about his family life as a child, his marriage to Elizabeth, raising a family, and sadly the loss of his son, Wade, in a tragic car accident.  He presents four trials, 2 medical malpractice, one wrongful death, and one product negligence.  He appears to truly care about his clients and seems to get to know them.  Some would say he appears to be &quot;too good to be true&quot;, I am from the south and I see a lot of people that share his caring attitude, so he seems real to me.  A must read if you enjoy legal drama, especially if you enjoy &quot;true stories&quot;.  He leaves out Senate information and never discusses an interest in the presidency, this book focuses entirely on the four trials with bits of his biographical information scattered among it.  A non-fiction book that reads as easily as the best drama.  Enjoy
