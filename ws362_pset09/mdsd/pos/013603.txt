As a student with a great deal of interest in Heidegger's ontological  inquiry, I found this to be an indispensable supplement to Being and Time.   Where Being and Time seems unbearably difficult to understand, History of  the Concept of Time offers clarification.  Since it is a collection of  lecture/notes, the writing is usually more straight-forward, which as we  know is a blessing when it comes to Heidegger.  I would recommend reading  Being and Time and History of the Concept of Time in tandem
