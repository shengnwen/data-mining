This book will scare the bejesus out of ya, so make sure you're ready for the in-your-face reality this book offers.  Are you ready to read about everything contributing to breast cancer from pesticides to plastic bottles?  We're talking bug spray, plastic water bottles, beef, cow's milk + milk products, nail polish, polish remover, furniture, hair dryers, computers, and on and on.  I was afraid to eat or touch anything for days!  But the premise of this book isn't to scare but to educate you.    

While this book focuses on progesterone and diet to ward off or control breast cancer from spreading, it also slams current drug treatments and drug companies, along with mammograms.  The information in this book is exactly the opposite of what your doctor will probably tell you. But are you willing to bet your life that your doc really knows what he or she is talking about and not just repeating the widespread word of rich and powerful drug companies or manufacturers of mammography equiptment?

So if you're like me and have just recently found a lump in your breast, take some time to get used to the idea that you might have cancer.  Then if you want to know the harsh reality about breast cancer, read this book.  It might just save your life
