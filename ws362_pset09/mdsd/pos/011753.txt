I read this book years ago when I randomly picked it up in a library and have never forgotten it. It was completely brilliant, totally off the wall. There was just something about it that I loved. I have never read any other Steel books, and from what i understand this was not her usual line of story. But it was such a great read. It must have been to have stuck out in my mind for about 5 years. I reacommend it to anyone who it open to an author not going by their steroetype
