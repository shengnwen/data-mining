This book has been indispensible in helping us to understand what is going on with our now 4 month old and how to best manage and nurture him through the phases. It also helps us to be patient when we understand what is going on with him. In addition to explaining each phase, the book includes signs of each phase, suggested activities, comments from other parents, and what to expect after the phase. The tone of the book is informative and does not push a specific child rearing pilosophy. I will buy it for all our new parent friends
