This is my favorite of the Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston books...I loved the concept of the treasure hunt...and the persistant lurking monsterous something that was always just one step ahead or behind them. The atmosphere of the desert ..and the ruins themself were so real that it made me feel like I had visited them myself when I saw pictures of the actual site..Now that is a great book that does that...but don't get me going on Preston and Child..I haven't read one yet that I would give less than 4 stars and the rest are all fives!!
