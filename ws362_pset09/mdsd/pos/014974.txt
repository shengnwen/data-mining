This is a moving and powerful radio documetary conduted by two 13 year old boys living in the Ida B. Wells housing project in Chicago's inner city. It is the story of their lives told in a real and honest way that leaves no one unmoved who hears it. Their mentor, David Isay, gives them the opportunity to tell the world what the life of a child growing up in an American ghetto is truly like. Sometmes hard to hear, the efforts of these young men are genuine and accurate and leave listeners with a glimpse into the problems that grip our inner cities. For anyone who wants to understand the lives and realities of families trapped in America's slums, this should rank at the top of the list. I highly recommend Ghetto Life:101 and Remorse. I use it every semester in my university social problems class. My students come  away with amazing insight as a result of these powerful documentaries.
