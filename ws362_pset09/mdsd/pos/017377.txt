This is a good critique of the assumptions made by Eurocentric historians over the years about the superiority of Europe as compared to the inferiority of the rest of the world.  Blaut effectively examines and explodes each theory dispassionately but thoroughly.  Finally he comes up with his own explanation for European success since 1492:  America.  Europe's &quot;discovery&quot; of and exploitation of North and South America gave it the wherewithall it needed to overtake and surpass the rest of the world.  A well written, well documented assessment which deserves a place beside The Great Divergence and ReOrient, among others
