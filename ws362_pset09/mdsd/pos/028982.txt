A charming piece that makes it all but impossible to read quietly... Mr. Bryson shares his experiences, lessons and insights about this challenging Appalachian Trail Hike he undertook with such drole humor.. We found ourselves giggleing on almost every page and stopping to share wonderful humor at least a few times a chapter. My sister did this with mom and my husband and I did it to each other despite the plan to read it ourselves. Went straight to Amazon.com to find his other works..
