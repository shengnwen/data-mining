This book contains a lot of information on the studies and polls the authors took of the greatest managers in the world. A lot of it is very tedious reading, however there is a HUGE pay off.My key learning from this book was: ALL great managers live outside the "BOX" of coporate America. They are not trapped by the "rules", they see the rules as only guidelines to achieve whatever the real purpose is of their business. They focus on the end result and not on doing things for the sake of doing them.I have found this book to be true in real life in watching promotions over the past 15 years in my own company. It could have been written better in a better format, but if you love information you will love this book. It's style is a lot like the book "The millionaire next door"
