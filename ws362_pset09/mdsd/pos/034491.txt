i found this book quite inspiring to read although hard to read in large increments(and im a voracious reader). It is a great intro to anarchist thought with  a primitivist bent. although i disagree with some of it(for instance i feel that when the available evidence is reviewed objectively it is hard to argue against the conspiratorial view of history convincingly and that conspiracy is just government doing business as usual). i also recomend 'Ishmael' by Daniel Quinn, 'Rule By Secrecy' by Jim Marrs, and 'David's Toolkit' by Ragnar Benson
