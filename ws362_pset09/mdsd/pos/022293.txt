Here is compendium of time tested recipes and herbal lore. I found this book on the shelf of an old shop in Michigan and began to read through it while sipping my tea. One really gets the effect of stepping back in time to a place where the village herbalist was the healthcare practitioner, and home remedies took presidence over scientific medicine. The book itself is even printed in a format to resemble the herbals of old, it looks an instant antique. I wish this book were still available in hardcover
