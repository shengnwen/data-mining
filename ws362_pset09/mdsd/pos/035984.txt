The Guide to Ridiculously Easy Entertaining: Tips from Marfreless is much more than a compilation of party favorite appetizer, drink, and side dish recipes (such as Bacon & Tomato Tartlets, Super Bowl Punch, or Potatoes & Stilton Gratin). The majority of The Guide to Ridiculously Easy Entertaining lives up to its title in that it walks the reader through exactly how to plan and throw a gala social event. Chapters address how to handle the initial planning, whether to hire help and if so how to go about it, the nuts and bolts of getting supplies and setting up, tips for being a gracious host, specific advice for dinner parties, wine tasting parties, work- related events, and much more. A glossary and extensive selection of references, such as lists of cocktail mixers, mailing guidelines, music suggestions, and many other useful fact sheets round out this all-purpose, easy-to-follow, must-have guide to creating a classy and memorable social gathering with great drink and food.
