A novel concerned more with its characters than any storyline, it's basically about the Peck family, especially the brothers Daniel and Caleb. Caleb, a musician, is not at all interested in the family business, which he is expected to take over with Daniel, and he runs away. The year is 1912. Daniel, and then his offspring, spend much of their lives looking for him.

Finally, after a private detective is hired, Caleb is located living in an old folks home for the poor in Louisiana. You'd expect this to be a good thing, but after all that, things don't turn out so hot: Daniel dies before being reunited with his brother and Justine, Daniel's granddaughter who brings Caleb home, is disappointed with him and leaves. It's a dark theme, but honest in its way, and Tyler handles it well. It's the most interesting thing about the book - the irony of the good turning bad. The book has a scattered feel about it, however, and some of the subplots are never resolved.
