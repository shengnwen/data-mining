As a mountain guide, I geuss I am more interested in the practical advice given in this book than whether it has enough slick style, perfect spelling, excellent grammar or impeccable editing. And really don't consider this book an excuse to ravage the Outside Magazine's style. 
 I have been using the original "Shape Of Your Life" workout that appeared in Outside Magazine for about 2 years, and was happy to see this book update that workout and take it to the next level. While this version takes more time out of my day to workout than the old version, it also seems to be getting me in better physical condition. As Mr. Scott says the program is only an outline and after I finish the 24 weeks I will start combining the best of the original workout with this one to keep it interesting
