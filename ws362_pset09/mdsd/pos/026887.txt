Now his brother will make a promise to avenge their youngest brother's death, but will going all out to kill their brother murderers come to be worse than the lost of Baby Brother? Will they lose another bother while trying 2 avenge the first one? Will it all be worth it? How far will they go for family?
   Baby Brother was a great book which showed how close family is and how far they would go for one another. Noire did a great job with the plot for the story. It was interesting throughout and didn't have any dry points. i really enjoyed the book and i know you will if you go out and buy it.
