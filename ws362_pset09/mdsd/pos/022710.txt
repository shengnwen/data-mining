Okay, a slight exaggeration, since I know there are plenty of people out there who alreay tie physics and their spirituallity together and allow that connection to help them lead wonderful lives. But if you are not one of those people who have tied your spiritual life with the science of the world, this book is the place to start. Wouldn't it be wonderful if all that you believed in could be backed by science and some of the greatest religious leaders of the world? That's what this book does for you. Oh! I just fricken love it!
