Considered by many to be Graham Greene's best work, "The Power and the Glory" deals with a familiar theme, the power and mystery of faith. In a fictional province of Mexico, religion has been banned, and the last priest is on the run. But he's not the stuff of which martyrs are made--he's a "whiskey priest" who has fathered a child. Now even his people despise him for his sins, and fear the danger he brings to their villages. Too afraid to just give himself up, half-hoping to get caught, the priest wanders from town to town, by chance just avoiding discovery. It's almost hard to see why the government searches for him so avidly. 

Mysteriously Greene sets this pathetic character on the road to real holiness. The priest comes to see his past life as petty and complacent, and realizes how much he despised his parishoners and was driven by ambition. At the same time he struggles with his inability to repent of the great sin of fatherhood--against all reason he irrationally loves the dirty little girl he meets only once during his wanderings. But he comes to see God's image in every man, even the despicable character who picks him up on a trail through the forest, who the priest knows will betray him. And he repents of his true sin--selfishness, lack of love and compassion, lack of humility. Although he doesn't know it the priest is a martyr and a saint at the end--perhaps a real martyr and saint cannot by definition realize it. Greene's work is always challenging, and although I read this novel in college I don't think I really understood it at all. But there's a reason this is a masterpiece--it's a thought-provoking work from a true master
