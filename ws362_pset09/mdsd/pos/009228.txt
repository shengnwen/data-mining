I thought the first 3 book in the series were just o.k. & I was glad to see that this 4th book finally pulled me into it.  This book is about Pearl, Ruby's daughter.  This book was adventurous & took you back & fourth to the Bayou.  I couldn't understand how Pearl recall as much as she did from her childhood when she lived in the Bayou because wasn't she like 9 months or something like that when she lived there?  This is my least favorite series of V.C. Andrews's series but I did enjoy this book
