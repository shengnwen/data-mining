So one day Mary Anne sees a haircut she likes and shows it to her friends.  They tell her it's not her at all, but she goes ahead and gets the cut anyway, along with some cute new clothes.  She starts to put on a little makeup, too.  When her friends see her new look, their reaction is less than enthusiatic.  And Dawn, her stepsister, is downright rude and mean about it.  Eventually all the girls quit talking to poor Mary Anne and start spreading rumors about her around school.  Umm...what happened to the BSC sticking together no matter what?  The only two who aren't suddenly turned against Mary Anne are Mallory and Jessi, who remain politley neutral throughout.  
Although shunning Mary Anne because of a haircut and a couple sweaters is a little extreme and unlike the BSC girls, I actually think that this book is a more realistic portrayal of middle school life than many of the other books in the BSC series - friends turning on you for seemingly no reason, rumor-spreading and gossip, etc.  I'm glad that they patched it up in the end (of course, we all knew they would!)
