There is a movie set to release for this wonderful book. I have no clue about the movie, but books are always better.  This is a very easy read for non ficton.  Learn the history of the french fry and not in a good way.  Learn about how things have changed in food sizes in fast food and how it has contributed to obesity of America.  This goes into details about someother issues of corporations like Walt Disney and the destruction of public transportation for cars.  It all fits together.  If you want to know about corporations and the history of how things got to be the way that they now read this.

This is a non ficton must read and it is interesting to meat eaters and vegatarians alike.  At least you will know who you are supporting when you buy certain things and how coroportations got to be the powerful level they are today.

Of another note:
This is just an interesting side to the Simplot story.
Interesting enough Simplot is focused on a small bit on a cable show about Ballet Idaho.  This is just a side, but the Idaho area where the simplots are from now is getting into organic farming area.  They play it on A and E Cable TV station periodically.  Not much about the potato, but more about the Simplot family
