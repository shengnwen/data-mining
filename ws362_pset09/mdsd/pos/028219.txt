Even though this is from the person that along with Gerald Gardner is the founder of witchcraft as we know it today, it is just more of the basics of Witchcraft for a beginning witch. I guess for me personally it restated that I was practicing it right and knew what I was talking about. If you're interested in witchcraft I would recommend this book along with Gerald Gardner's Witchcraft Today and even though it's a little different Aleister Crowley's Magick in Theory and Practice and Book Four. Witchcraft is surpsingly simple if you that one plus one equals two unless you are going to do group rituals those I found were complex but solitary witchcraft is very easy.
