I knew I would love this book from the moment I started reading it! Barbara Rose puts it simple, but not understated.  Some of my favorite lines, "But we do have individual power to create rainbows from the rivers of tears we have shed." and "The truth shall set you free.  If you do settle for less, then you are not living your truth. You are, once again, riding your river with each leg in a different canoe, where pain is the only possible result."  One constant that runs through all of Barbara's books is she teaches and shares straight from her heart; sharing some of her most painful experiences to give the reader real life examples of how to overcome the challenges many of us face in our lifetime. Individual Power is a book filled with inspiration and clear-cut tools for personal transformation. So personal, so real, so simple, but profound. When you come to the end, believing you are done, you will feel inspired to fully transform your life. Then a surprise gift, an "afterword", sharing a letter filled with divine wisdom.  Barbara is once again far exceeding her goal to uplift humanity one book at a time
