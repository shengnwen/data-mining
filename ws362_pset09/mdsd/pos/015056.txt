It took me a bit to get into the rhythm of the author's style, but once there I found the book both thought provoking and very much in tune with the problems and ideaology of our current times.  As I ventured into the lives of the people in Commonwealth one recurring line from history kept repeating itself in my mind - "we have nothing to fear, but fear itself".  Fear ultimately devastated these people far more than the Spanish Influenza of 1917-18.  

This book is a good read whose story will stay with you long after you have read the final page.  My next book to read will be "The Great Influenza" recommended by the author as his story has totally hooked me on that time and period of history
