This book was wonderful.  It gave a great explanation of how the story of Valentine's Day came about.  It also had crafts and other fun stuff you could do in the back of the book.  This book can teach the history and meaning/purpose of Valentine's Day in an interesting way.  The pictures are wonderful.  The bright colors add so much to the story.  I would recommend this book in a hearbeat
