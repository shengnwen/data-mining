William Pollack certainly has impressive credentials with respect to writing on this topic.  This is apparent from the editorial reviews above.  More importantly, he is a good writer who brings the inner life of boys and the challenges they face in our society to life.  He provides both an inside view and a worthwhile outside perspective.

One of the repeating themes in the books is that we have contradictory expectations of men (boys) in our contemporary society.  For example, on one level we expect men to be strong, tough, etc.  At the same time, there is also a tacit expectation that contemporary men embrace the "New Age" ideal of being tender and vulnerable.  Dr. Pollack points out that this causes many men to feel conflicted and often reduces them to painful silence and often isolation.

While Dr. Pollack covers the inside life of boys, he also does an admirable job of citing relevant statistics on how boys performance is slipping academically and other useful objective sociological data.  He covers this issue from every angle and goes beyond diagnosing the problems to making concrete suggestions for parents, schools and society at large.

This book is a valuable addition to the literature on boys and the challenges they face.  It is definitely a must own book for anyone who is raising a boy along with "Parenting from the Inside Out" by Daniel Siegel which is great for any parent.
