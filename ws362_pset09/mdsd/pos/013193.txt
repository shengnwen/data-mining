If anyone deserves to have the public reminded of how superb an athlete and how complete and special a person he was, it is Roberto Clemente. He was often taken for granted in life, as if the magic of his rounding second for a stand-up triple was something that happens all the time. And to see him field the ball and throw the batter out from deep in right field was not to be believed. It is poetic justice of a kind that his last regular season hit was no. 3,000. His death came far too soon, but for what a cause!
And if you can believe it, Mr. Maraniss has written a book worthy of his subject, moving, breathtaking at times, and all in all, a great read about a great and much-missed man. I couldn't recommend it more enthusiastically
