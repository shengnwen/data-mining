Thank you once again to Lynne Cheney for caring enough to write a book for all of us who need to appreciate the history of our country more than we do. This book does more than just inform, it invites the average American to delight in the events that have contributed to the forming of our great America. I am proud to be an American and have watched friends and family make sacrifices for the freedom of all, but I remain one of the typical victims of the history snobs (otherwise known as history professors and experts) who cared more about impressing students with their high intellect than instilling a love for the history of our country in their students.  Even at my age, after reading this book I am motivated to read more about some of the historical events presented in Mrs. Cheney's enlightening timeline. I am encouraged that a book like this can be given to young people and we can expect that their interest in historical events will be piqued.  I plan to give this book to many people (young and old) as a gift to them and to all of us who want to see the pride and love of American history returned to its people! I highly recommend this book
