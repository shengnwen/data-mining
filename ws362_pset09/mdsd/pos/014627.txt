Stephanie finally is getting comfortable in her own skin. In this episode, she decides that being a bail bondsman is not really "her." She's smart enough to know, however, that she doesn't know what is really "her." By the end of the book, she realizes that the problem is her zany life, and that she was actually pretty good at her job. It's about time. There are plenty of jokes, some of them the standard blown up cars, Grandma Mazur with a gun, etc., but the joke is no longer Stephanie. On a number of occasions she takes independent action, trumping the police, basically solving the murder, and dispensing a moderate amount of violence where appropriate. Good for her. The series had grown a little tired. Good to see that it's gotten a second wind
