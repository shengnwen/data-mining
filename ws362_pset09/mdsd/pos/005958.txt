Carolyn Myss is brilliant, entertaining, witty, sarcastic, irrational, and high-handed at any given time.  She admits that she teaches rather than heals because she isn't good at one on one.  But she is a gifted teacher.  Listening to the CDs the third time I still gained more information and have since shared them with friends of like mind.  If you're drawn to increasing your knowledge of the spiritual journey, this is a great set of CDs to listen to. She offers several interesting theorys, some believable, some not, but still entertaining
