This book is really great, it's about a very important but little understood issue.  It's full of factual documentation of all aspects of the MIA issue -- from how the counting was done, to the various political angles the issue took at various times throughout the war -- and is a great read, as well.  It brought back a lot of memories of the bizarre things that went on then, and still do today
