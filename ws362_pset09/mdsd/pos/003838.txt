This is the one cookbook that turned me on to the entire Moosewood Restaurant series.  I can make pretty much any recipe in the cookbook without worrying about how it will taste when it's done -- everything tastes terrific!  I love the fact that I can just use the index when I've got zucchini in the fridge & I'm not sure what to do with it.  One warning though -- you're going to want to double most of the recipes.  Leftovers are a blessing.  :
