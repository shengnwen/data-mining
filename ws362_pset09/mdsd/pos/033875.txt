This was a very easy to read book that I found comforting during my 17 month struggle of TTC.  I enjoyed her take on relaxing the body and mind and felt that I benefited from the book.  It was a fairly quick read for me.  I am only giving it 4 stars because even though I had been TTC for almost 2 years, the last part of the book was a little scary to me, discussing the failure rates of procedures like IUI and IVF, and talking about how the odds are stacked against you.  It also talked about making the decision to be childless, which although realistic, put me into a panic.  Overall it is a wonderful book and after 17 months of trying, 1 week after I finished the book I found out I was pregnant.  Of course we are very excited.... and I appreciated the irony of reading such a book and feeling very worried, and then finally being pregnant.  It did help me to relax and try to put things into perspective
