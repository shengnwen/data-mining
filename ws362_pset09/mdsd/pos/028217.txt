This is a perfect example of edutainment at its best.  Terrfic fun while simultaneously teaching you a great deal about the key factors that determine a teams win rate.  Aside from the style and the analysis this book also does something even more valuable: It highlights a management approach that is truly based on merit, as opposed to how "pretty" an athelete is or how much charisma they have.  For people who believe that the USA is as close as any country to being a meritocracy - this book is a shining example of just that.  I am truly astonished and dismayed by the negative reviews I have read.  I can't wait for Lewis to write his next book.
