Using their own words, Connie Fletcher lets a group of Chicago police officers tell anecdotes and stories about the things they face every day when they go to work. Some are hilarious, as you'd expect. But most are tales of frustration, anger, and sorrow, with the occasional triumph when the good guy wins and the bad guy gets put away 'til he's gray. To hear them tell it that doesn't happen enough, but they keep going until they burn out, transfer off the street, or quit altogether. Too often they die in the line of duty, and when that happens, their fellow officers sincerely mourn the loss.

It surprised me to discover how compassionate these men and women are...not only toward the victims they comfort, but criminals they arrest and help convict. What Cops Know will give you a true picture of what cops think, too
