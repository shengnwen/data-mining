This book hits home for me as my mom has been in a nursing home for seven years.  Ms. Macomber has hit the nail on the head as the role reversal scenes play themselves out.  I hope those who will be going through that phase of life will take notes and be prepared for it.  It's not an easy task but it a rewarding one.  Thank you, Ms. Macomber
