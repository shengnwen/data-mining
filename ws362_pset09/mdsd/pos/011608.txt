The Dance Hall of the Dead is a well written novel that blends fiction with nonfiction.  The story mainly takes place in and around the Zuni reservation in New Mexico.  The story is intertwined with Zuni culture and presents references to Navajo and Archaic culture.  I am not very familiar with the Zuni culture, so i do not know how accurate his cultural references are.  I found this book to be an easy and fun read.  Although a little slow at first, the story builds on unanswered questions that will have you second guessing until the very end. Anyone interested in the Zuni, archaeology, or that enjoys a mystery/thriller should give this book a try
