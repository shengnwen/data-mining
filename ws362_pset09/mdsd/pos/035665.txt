Usually i shy away from sugar coated girly teen books, but this one stuck on me.  
The proverbial different girls from different worlds ban together for the summer and evolve into young women (and thats no joke)
The writing is so tangible, just thinking about the book makes me want to:
skinny dip 
eat a peach  
kiss a boy ;
