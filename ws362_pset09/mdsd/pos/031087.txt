Tavis is a man that puts God first and he has never made him last.  The book is truly remarkable. Just when I thought he had reached his highest potential, here he goes again.  Just like the man, the book intrigues the mind to think outside of the box. He tells of his strengths his weaknesses, his successes, his failures and each lesson that was learned along the way.  Keep it coming Tavis, keep intriguing the mind to think. This is story about how he became the man he is today....! I just gave my teenage son the book and i will be purchasing copies for each of the young men in my family.
