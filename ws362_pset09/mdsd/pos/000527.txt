richard laymon is known for his horror fiction, but this one is different...i suppose it could be labeled horror, but in a nutshell, this book is hilarious. it will have you busting your gut. alas, it does have its brutality and disturbing moments, but it is good wicked fun. fans and new readers will delight as this is a hard one to put down. Its something like 502 pages but seems more like three hundred..its every mans fantasy come to life, however, i know women who have read this book and have enjoyed it as well. brings a whole new outlook on being shipwrecked on a deserted island...laymon's dark sense of humor and fluid writing style bring this one to life...have fun
