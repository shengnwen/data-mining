This collection of short stories presents a strong and unique voice, wonderful composition, and a genuine sweetness missing in other "modern" works.  There is a painful beauty expressed in the empty places explored here.  The reader is reminded of his own humanity in an absence of emotion, a dose of existential angst, and the cold, barbaric nature of the world into which Saunder's characters are placed.  This book is sad, funny and powerful, all at once.  I read it regularly
