I bought this book because I needed a better understanding of contracts during my 1L year. This book expanded upon the contracts outline I already had, put out by the same authors, C&P. This horn book was helpful for understanding a few areas more in depth, especially for another class where I needed to dig deeper than what was taught in contracts. On one hand, this book was readily available in the school library (probably yours too) and therefore was probably not a necessary purchase. On the other hand, it will probably be a more useful book for me in and out of practice, since lawyers and non-lawyers alike use contracts throughout life.
