Of course, the twin towers mean many different things and to many different people than they did a year ago when this book first came out.  But that, in many ways, is the pleasure of this book.  It looks at the twin towers from a perspective not clouded by the recent tradegy of the towers.  The author, Eric Danton in Divided We Stand (A Biography of New York's World Trade Center) is unflinching in looking at the creation of these towers on many fronts, including philosophical, economic and political, with the Rockefeller brothers playing the pivotal roles.  This book glosses over or ignores the building's technical aspects, for those who are interested (and truthfully, it would have been helpful at times to keep things in perspective).  The parts describing terrorism and the towers in ruins (and there are a number of times these are mentioned) are painfully chilling.  This is a honest examination of an important part of New York (and now American) history
