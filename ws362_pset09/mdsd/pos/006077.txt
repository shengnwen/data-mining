All age groups should enjoy this book, but people who remember Red leading the Celtics will particularly enjoy it. You don't have to be a Celtics fan to enjoy this book. Feinstein does a great job of telling numerous entertaining stories that provide great insights into Red. You come away from this book not only enjoying the stories but also loving Red because it was obvious that this was a man who truly loved life. The book primarily deals with basketball stories that you will love but it also addresses Red's interaction with his close and diverse group of "lunch buddies". This part of the book provides an extra charm. I couldn't put this book down. It is one of the most enjoyable sports books I have ever read---right up there with the best stuff Roger Kahn and Roger Angell ever wrote.
