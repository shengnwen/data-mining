As always no one book is complete for a certification exam. I used the Network+ from Syngress as my main book and then used this one as a review/catch everything the other one missed book. I have found the Cram series to be the best for that. They give you alot of information but don't go into a huge amount of detail about most of it. If you are new to networks or certifications, don't use this as the only book for your cert. If you have already been working in networks and just getting the cert, this will be a good refresher.
