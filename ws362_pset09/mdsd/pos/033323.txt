My wife dragged me out to Danker Furniture in Fairfax to buy a couch back in 1988.  I knew we had little money, and so I let her do the talking.  The store had prop books on the shelves so I picked up the Roosevelt Myth, sat in an armchair and could't stop reading for the next forty minutes.  Finally I told the salesman, I don't want a couch but I'll give you a sawbuck for this book.  He let me have it gratis.  It was a copy that had been annotated in pencil on the back cover.  Flynn spared no effort to detail how thoroughly dishonest FDR was in every aspect of his life.  He used to play up his infantile paralysis for public sympathy.  He even abused his office to pursue his hobby: collecting stamps!  By 1944 his mental health was so bad that he zoned out during a radio address.  Of course the fawning craven toadies of the press dutifully covered everything up, but not Flynn.  He saw a picture with an admiral's sleeve showing.  He asked for an uncropped photo and contacted the admiral for the truth while the rest of the scribblers dished out wartime propaganda.  Seem familiar?  It should, Clinton cheated -- probably still does -- at golf and the press has not changed a bit.  Roosevelt made sure that Flynn was punished for writing this courageous work, because he lost his position as editor of Colliers magazine as a result.  Most so-called reporters haven't the guts to try a work of this kind today
