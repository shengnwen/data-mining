Leave to Lloyd Kaufman to release the 'novelization' of The Toxic Avenger over 25 years after the movies releasE, but, if you're a fan of Toxie, Troma or Lloyd, this is a MUST OWN book!  Just the fact that purchasing the book supports the fine people at Troma, the book is a great novel, riddled with the sense of humor that Lloyd is famous for, and that alone is worth the price of admission!!!

If you haven't already, or if you're thinking about it, BUY THE BOOK, you won't regret it!!
