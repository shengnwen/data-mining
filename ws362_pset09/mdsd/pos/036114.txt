This is probably Belloc's most famous piece of social commentary. Published in 1912, it foretold the
gradual merger of capitalism and socialism to form what we today call the &quot;consumer society.&quot;
Belloc traces Western economic development from Roman times. He argues that the West had just
 shed the last vestiges of feudal slavery in favor of an independent yeomanry by the late Middle Ages
 when the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century turned all this around, and resulted in the
 polarization of wealth that has continued to this day. His thesis is that capitalism, left to itself, is
 inherently unstable and must rely on state intervention. Ultimately, however, the large corporations
 benefit from moderate socialism. The mass of working people are reduced to servile wage earning
 conditions -- achieving basic material comfort, but no meaningful economic freedom -- being kept in
 line by the bureaucrats to the benefit of big business
