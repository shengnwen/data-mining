I live in CT and wanted to take up hiking.. I was pleasantly surprised with the range of hikes covered in this book. Especially areas I never would have thought had a decent hike, like my hometown of Waterbury! Because of the amount of hikes covered, the info for each is pretty short. It does suggest other places to get info though and is great for what it is- a survey of New England hikes, not in depth for any one area or type of hike
