While many people classify themselves as trainers and experts, who better to get advice from than a man wo won Mr. America, Mr. USA, tied Arnolds record of four NABBA Mr. Universe wins, beat every great champion from the 50's to the 70's including Sergio Oliva, Frank Zane and Reg Park and has been training everyone from Joe Average wanting to get in shape to Mr. Olympia winners like Chris Dickerson. 

Pearl has been training himself and training others for over 50 years! And now he is a best selling author as well. But more importantly, he is a expert in  bringing out your maximum potential.

I  highly recommend this book by the great Bill Pearl. You won't be dissappointed
