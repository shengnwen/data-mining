I've been adicted to these books ever since I opened the princess diares 1.  This book is a step up from the rest showing Mia going through real problems.  She truly becomes an adult in this book.  The ending is extremly good because it doesn't really end.  Becuase I'm so adicted to these books, I was overjoyed when I knew Meg wasn't done just yet.  I'm was really happy reading this book and I'll be the first in line for the next
