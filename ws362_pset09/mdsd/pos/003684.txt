Circle of Grace was the first Penelope Stokes book I had read. I loved it & was hooked! I work in a library & recommended it to people I came in contact with. Several of my co-workers read it as well & agreed that it was a very good read. I have since read more of hers & am reading one now. I love the way she writes & felt such emotions when I read Circle of Grace. I definitely recommend it to anyone that loves a feel good book
