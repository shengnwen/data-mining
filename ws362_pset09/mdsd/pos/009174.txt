I don't know, maybe it's the fact that I love swirling circles of plotting, their undercurrents, and the ultimate culmination or failure of those plans.  In these recent chapters of "The Wheel of Time", paying close attention to who is where, saying what to who, can REALLY get you closer to an understanding of what the Forsaken/Chosen are up to as well as other characters/orginizations.  I don't see how some of these others giving reviews can call it boring with some of the ever-present threat of dangers coming in between Rand, Perrin, Mat, Egwene, other Aes Sedai from Salidar, Elayne, Aviendha, Tar Valon Aes Sedai, and not to mention the Seanchan.  Robert Jordan has created an incredibly complex flow of conflict between several different sides and still has been able to move the plot toward the inevitable Tarmon Gai'don.  Underneath it all, he constantly shifts the point of view of the reader around between the characters giving different views on the same issue.  Not the least of which is the seemingly constant battle of male vs. female view of dominance and understanding of issues in whole.  I for one commend the author on his ability to "weave flows" this complex and still keep a hold on the basic plot
