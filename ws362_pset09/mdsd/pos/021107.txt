The earlier edition of this book was one of the first books I read on psychopathy/sociopathy, and none since have improved on for a good description of what the behavior and thinking patterns are for this category of people.  If you're not sure what a psychopath is, see the movie, "Catch Me If You Can"; both father and son were portrayed as psychopaths or sociopaths.  Psychopaths can appear perfectly normal and high-functioning, if viewed from a distance, but are all survival-of-the-cleverest up close.  I think psychopathy probably has origins in early attachment issues and/or living under the threat of abuse; "Mask of Sanity" needs more on origins, but is great descriptively
