The best book I've ever read.  Captivating and beautifully written.  David Guterson is master of storytelling.  A heart wrenchful novel that captivates the reader which make him the best writer of this century.  The movie adds up that make thispiece of work unforgettable.  It stays with me and lingers on for a long time.  David you are so damn good I wish I could give this 6 stars or more.
