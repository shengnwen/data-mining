I generally don't expect modern thrillers to be examples of great writing. I don't know why. Maybe I have figured that the stories are enough and they will just be entertaining. With LeCarre, I was wrong.

LeCarre is an amazingly good writer. The Constant Gardener is drama, well beyond "thrill". Over 560 pages and still I could hardly put it down.

I have only one complaint and warning. With writing like this--imagistic, attention to detail of language and culture--I cannot imagine why anyone would want to see it as a movie, or even be forced to see a photo from the movie, such as the one on the cover here. So hopefully you'll be lucky like me to reach this web page only after you've read the book, from an older copy that's light blue with three bees on the cover.

If you have to buy the new edition, have a friend do it and rip off the front cover first ..
