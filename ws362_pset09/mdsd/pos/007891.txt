I really enjoyed this book.  It had an engaging storyline and the dynamics between the mother and her daughters, as well as the relationships between the sisters themselves, were quite believable and sometimes too close to home.  The youngest sister, however, was not as developed a character as she should have been - she was mostly ignored by the author and was an incidental character.  The southern locales in the book are interesting, and I was initially drawn to the book by its title, as I own a bed and breakfast, although not in the same circumstances as Josie in the book.  Her nemesis guest made me chuckle - I know that woman!  I highly recommend this book as a good rainy afternoon read; happy endings earn my recommendation, and I don't think my saying it ends happily will spoil the reader's enjoyment of Bed &amp; Breakfast
