This is an adorable children's book that is thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike!  Cute humor is interspersed in this story of a jolly pirate.  As one might imagine, a jolly pirate is not exactly ideal--or is it?  And is there a reason for a pirate flag to be called The Jolly Roger?  Read this book to find out.  A great book to accompany this one is How I became a Pirate.  This story has become a favorite in my second grade classroom.  It was a great bargain.  Share this book with a special child in your life. I love books that can combine humor with a plot that hooks kids; this is one of those books
