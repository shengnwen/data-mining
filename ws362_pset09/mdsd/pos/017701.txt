This is a funny book that shows a cat who jumps to attention at the sound of a bugle, and has more stripes than a drill sergeant. While captains don't wear stripes (they have bars), the book is a funny look at miltary life, from the perspective of a cat who innocently wanders onto an army post and is befriended by a soldier. The book is suitable for K-3, but is also a good choice for older readers who need the confidence that successfully completing a book on his or her own provides. This book was available in my son's elementary school library, which I believe says something for its broad appeal
