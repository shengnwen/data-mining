I happened upon this book in a used bookstore, and bought it on a whim.  All the way thru the book (read practically in one sitting), I kept thinking of how I was reading the story of Tony Soprano in his life as a day trader!  Humerous, silly, engaging, challenging, stressful, vain, self-aggrandizing, amd more.  I couldn't put it down, and I doubt you will want to either
