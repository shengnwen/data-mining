These four books are so far the best Christian Fiction books I have read.  My interest was captured from the first page of the first book until the last page of the last book.  All the characters showed the love of Christ,  the struggles Christians have in this world, and how great a blessing  Chirst in your life is.  This series is perfect for Christians as well as  non-christians.  Special meanings and feelings come out for the Christians  in their walk, as for the non-christians, they would not be  &quot;threatened&quot; by the way this book is written.  Best set of books  I have ever read.  I have already started reading them for the second time,  they are easily each read in one day, because once you start you don't  stop
