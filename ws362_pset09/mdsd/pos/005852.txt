This is one of the most useful books I have read in the past year.

I live immersed in a Burning Man, neo-hippies-with-money world, and so many things about my friends, my culture and my own life made no sense until I read this book. I found particularly compelling the story about the clash between the old WASP elites and the rising technocratic, bohemian elite in the 1960s. The "Sixties" is, I believe, much better understood as a clash between elites.

I believe the next great clash of elites will be between national elites and global elites. Watch for it.

I am Bobo. Hear me Roar.

Thank you, Mr. Brooks, for giving me a context for my culture
