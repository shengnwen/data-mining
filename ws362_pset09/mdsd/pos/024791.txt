First of all, I don't see why Amazon would print a reveiw by someone like David Smith who admittingly only read 4 pages of the book.  I'm a big David Sedaris fan from way back.  My favorite book of his is "Barrell Fever."  That book had me not only laughing out loud, but calling friends and reading them entire essays.  His childhood recollections in this book are funny, particularly when they involve his sisters, but this one, for me, wasn't as entertaining as the other books.  And this one felt too short, as well.  Regardless, David Sedaris is a great writer and a great performer.  I saw him live once and got the change to meet him afterwards and he lives up to his talent.  As for Mr Smith who called him a young pretentious writer, David is at least in early 40's.  Trust me there are much younger and more pretentious writers out there.  And had he taken the time to read the book he would find out, that unlike many memiors, this book does not ask for any pity or sympathy even in his worst of times.  He's simply showing you how he and his family have always been able to find the humor in even the darkest of moments.  There's nothing pretentious abou that
