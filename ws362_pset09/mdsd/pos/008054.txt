Say what you will about James Patterson--the man knows how to keep the pages turning.

Having gotten hooked on Alex Cross when ALONG CAME A SPIDER debuted in 1993, it's been fascinating to watch both Cross and his creater evolve.

The books have gotten shorter (CROSS is at least 20,000 words less than SPIDER) and the pace has gotten faster (90 chapters for SPIDER, 121 for CROSS.) Patterson wants you to turn pages, and turn them quickly. He accomplishes this by streamlining the story--CROSS is all dialog and action. There is minimal setting description, very little exposition, and no padding at all. It's lean and fast.

As a result, many readers will be able to finish this in one or two sittings.

But is shorter and faster actually better?

In the case of CROSS, yes. By cutting away the fat, Patterson has managed engage the reader more completely. Why spend 500 pages on a story that only needs 380? If the purpose of thriller fiction is to find out what happens next, then the writing is there to serve the story, rather than the story being there to serve the writing.

I wouldn't say the plot of CROSS is superior to any of Patterson's other novels, or the villain more terrifying, but it certainly gets to the point faster, and in my opinion that makes it a better book
