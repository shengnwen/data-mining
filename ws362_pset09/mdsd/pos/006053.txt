The quote on the back cover from Harvey Steiman of the Wine Spectator attracted my attention to this book. He says "Wine Lover's Companion packs a tremendous amount of useful, intriguing information about wine. This book is a joy to use-information is what it is all about." As I browsed through it I could see what he was talking about. I purchased it about a month ago and have learned so much. At 15 bucks it's worth every cent and more. I just got interested in wine about 3 months ago and have looked through a couple of the "introductory" wine books and although they are useful, Wine Lover's Companion is the one I go to first to look up a new term or find out about a wine growing region or how to pronounce something (I haven't seen another wine book address this at all). If you're new to the world of wine this is a must have.
