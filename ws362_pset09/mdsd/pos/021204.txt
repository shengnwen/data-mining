The Dalai Lama teaches how to make every action part of your spiritual practice and, in doing so, create a meaningful life filled with happiness. He recommends disconnecting the attachment of your happiness from the material circumstances of your life and opening instead to the true source of your happiness which is your inner peace of mind. There is a section on Buddhist Tantra and a discussion of how sexuality can be used in the search for peace and kindness. Dalai Lama means "ocean of wisdom." The fourteenth Dalai Lama (Tenzin Gyatso) won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 as the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet. At the age of two, in accordance with Tibetan tradition, he was recognized as the reincarnation of his predecessor, the thirteenth Dalai Lama. In 1950 (the year of the Chinese invasion of Tibet), at age 16, he was called upon to assume full political power and leadership. Since 1960 he has resided in Dharamsala, India, aptly known as "Little Lhasa," the seat of the Tibetan government in exile.
