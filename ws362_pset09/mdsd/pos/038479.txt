This is a fantastic, classic book written in the 50s and much loved by the generation that began reading in the 50s and 60s!  Today's children should like it just as much, especially those interested in space travel and science-fiction.
I recently ordered the first two titles in the 'Mushroom Planet' series when I saw that the cover was by Steve Vance.  When they arrived, 'Stowaway' did have the Steve Vance cover (as shown on the Amazon website), but the cover of 'The Wonderful Flight' was by Kevin Hawkes and not Steve Vance.  I'm returning the latter title and hoping that I can get a copy of it somewhere with the cover by Steve Vance as seen on the Amazon website.  Hopefully the entire series will be freshly reprinted for another generation to enjoy.
