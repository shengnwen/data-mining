This book was recommended as a Father's Day gift in a magazine and being that my Dad LOVES golf, I thought it was a sure thing.  It ended up being way more than that.  The book is beautiful!  Don't tell anyone but it is way underpriced.  It looks like a $50 coffee table book.  My mom thought I had paid $80 to $100 for it.  My Dad loves it so much that he displayed it on top of tv in the living room. He was giddy to find many courses in the book that he had played.  The only downside I could see was that my Dad may find numerous golf courses around the world that he now feels he has to go and play
