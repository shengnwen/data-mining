I have wanted this book for close to a whole decade. I rented the movie Excalibur when I was like 13 years old and loved it. I watched it over and over again, finally getting a new VHS edition of what has to be easily the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. As I watched the credits in the movie Excalibur, I noticed it said it was based on Malory's novel Le Morte D'Arthur. I thought the book would be really expensive and hard to find. Finally one day last summer I was able to get thid paperback edition and I found it even lower the cover price of $7.99. I read the book and was surprised. It did have some of what was based in the movie Excalibur, but it was a large collection of individual stories of the legendary characters. I was expecting something more in line exactly with the script of the Ezcalibur movie. After initial surprise, I read the book and liked it, if only for sentimental value. It was written in the 1500s! I like really old gothic and occult literature and now can read them very fast. I usually read 10 pages a sitting and at multiple sittings a day and sometimes reading more than 10 pages you can through books even long 500 page ones like this fast. It is a classic that stands the test of time. This is a savage and barbaric book, this is what it has in common most with the movie Excalibur. When most people think of King Arthur they think like A Kid in King Arthur's Court. Well Excalibur is more realistic and this book if King Arthur really existed this what it would've been more like. Though it borders on cheese- knights in armor getting limbs severed, etc, but the special effects in Excalibur, the script, the acting, everything made up for that is regarded amongst even mainstream movie fans as a masterpiece. I would recommend this if you want to know the real story of King Arthur, not a childish fantasy...surprise...Arthur dies
