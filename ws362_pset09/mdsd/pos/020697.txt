  This is more a review of the reviewers than the book itself.  Hear me out.
  First, I rated this book 4 stars, becuase i love it, but there is always room for improvement.  WOTC is great about revising it's material through the website with additional errata and "enhancements". 
  Second, I would like to point out the subtitle of the book for those who think the Demons CR are too low.  HORDES of the Abyss.  While a particular Demon Lord may have a "relatively" low CR, when do you think you will have the opportunity as a party to face a foe like Orcus?  One should assume that the DM has used this source material to provide for said HORDES, the armies that all these demons command is the meat of the Abyss which a party must cut through before striking at it's heart.
  Additionally, this IS the first of (as of now) 2 books in the series. This one deals with the Layers of the Abyss, thus Demons. The upcoming release (December i believe), is called Tyrants of the 9 Hells, thus, DEVILS.  Devils are superior to demons, and will have equivelant CR's.  So now your Epic characters have something to do, though i find it hard to believe they stand at the 666th layer of the Abyss saying "well, what next?"
  I am running a campaign that will have my party facing the armies of Tiamat (thank you MM4), and I plan to use much of this material to run my PC's through the veritable guantlet before said confrontation.  It will be trully Epic.
  I believe this book is intended more for DM's than PC's, though a demonic party sure sounds fun.  There is plnety of material here, as previously mentioned in other reviews for the kind of gaming that should have you a little suspicious of the shadows before you fall asleep.
