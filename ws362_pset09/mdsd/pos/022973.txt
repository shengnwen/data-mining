We used this for reviewing SAT Language Skills.  It was useful.  For math it was somewhat weak.  We ended up doing Kaplan SAT Prep Math Workbook.  That book had plenty of practice problems for each concept - especially helpful for students who are doing more advanced math.  The geometry and Algebra II could be two years out of use by the time they review these concepts.  This book has many practice tests from the official SAT organization.  It doesn't get much better than that for practice tests
