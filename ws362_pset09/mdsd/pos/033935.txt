this is a Good Book for Younger brothers coming along now. the kind of Book while you are in High School& or just getting ready to graduate from College. the kind of Book that I wish I had have had back in the day to read. Props to Hill Harper for given back&saying the most important things to uplift.i enjoyed the various quotes&overall vibe of the Book. this is a strong Book. very uplifting
