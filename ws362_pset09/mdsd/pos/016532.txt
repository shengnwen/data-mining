This is the best WWII book I've read since Ghost Soldiers.  The author bring to life an historical moment in World War II that could be lost as a footnote in history.   The men mentioned in the book come to life, and one begins to indetifly with them, so that you want to turn to that last page and find out what became of these heroes after the war.  Like Ghost Soldiers, once you pick it up you can't put it down
