This is a collection of information on many different aspects of the Global Warming situation.  There were chapters that made my blood boil with excitement, and this is nonfiction!  I took this book along on a cruise and alternated the chapters with fiction, but each chapter is interesting in its own way.  I am now retired, but for many years I was an Earth Science teacher using a video titled, The Greenhouse Conspiracy.  That was quite a film, but it is a bit dated and I was wondering if things had changed.  Shattered Consensus says no, things haven't changed since that movie was made
