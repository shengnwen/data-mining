Pardon the pun, author's last name and well, you get it. This is the second in a trilogy by Sandra Worth detailing the life of Richard III. I found it to be much better reading than the first! The pace was much faster and I found myself with a REAL page turner in my hands!

In this novel Richard III is a conscientious, principled man and the author's story really brings this across. How difficult it must have been to become something you never wanted, King of England. Anne Neville, wife to Richard is also a courageous, strong willed person whose health was anything but. She also never desired to be a monarch, Queen, no less of England. Hers and Richard's lives were destined to be anything but what they truly desired. Their cherished but short lived privacy was shattered, especially when Richard accepted the crown. Their son's health was also a source of great joy but greater sorrow.

I vastly enjoyed this second novel in the trilogy and am very much looking forward to the third!
