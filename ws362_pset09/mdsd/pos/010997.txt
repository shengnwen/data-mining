Try as I might to approach Leviticus as a spiritual opportunity ... I just came up wondering what God's message to me might be in this lengthy discourse. The book is hard rocks!

"Leviticus as Literature" is anthropology ... low on theology. The book is in itself a difficult read simply because Leviticus is so difficult. This is not a criticism at all, I do not how anyone could write a spunky guide to Leviticus.

Bottom line, I have a far better understanding of the  Levitical concepts ... Animal sacrifice revealed, centralized vs decentralized temple, forbidden foods, strange laws. I never caught subtle, interesting contrasts and parallels with Deuteronomy. 

My take away ... I think I have both a vague and a somewhat clearer bead on the Levitical context in the larger Biblical context. The question I was hoping to answer in this read was "what is God communicating to me in Leviticus?". I'm futher along in understanding
