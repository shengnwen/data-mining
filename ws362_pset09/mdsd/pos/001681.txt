This is a good fibromyalgia book to buy if you have just been diagnosed and you are looking for practical advice on how to cope with your illness.  Though not as detailed and complete as Starlanyl and Copeland's  Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome, it is also less  overwhelming and so is particularly good for someone who is feeling  overwhelmed, doesn't like a lot of medical information, or has a mild form  of the disease.  The chapters &quot;You aren't alone&quot;, &quot;Making  Lifestyle adjustments,&quot; and &quot;Practical helps for specific  problems&quot; are quite good, as are the three chapters on managing  fatigue, stress, and flareups
