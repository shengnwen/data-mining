The second of Jowett and Andrew's series on the Italian Army during the second world war, this volume is much like the first.  The campaign narratives are especially interesting, and include orders of battle {for the Italians}, as well as nicely illustrated rank insignia charts.  Narratives on the uniforms and equipment are brief and not very comprehensive, and the illustrations are composites from photographs and basically copied from the first volume.  48 pages in length, it's a good reference for the beginning military historian or collector
