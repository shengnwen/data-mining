This is a cute and fun book.  I don't usually choose Eric Carle books, but this is one of the best books I've read to my almost-2 year old this year.   Even my 5 year old likes it.  Fun, imaginative, and we really like the  little face on Little Cloud in the beginning of the story.  This  small/medium board book size is a plus, too, easy for little hands
