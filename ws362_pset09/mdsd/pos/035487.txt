This book is a very good resource for those military wives who don't know much about what they have gotten themselves into. It breaks it all down from how to budget to what to wear at a tea. It caters to all branches of the armed forces, not just the Navy as other reviewers have noted. It is definitely a good starter book. Pick this one up but keep in mind that it is a good idea to check out more than just one resource when you are trying to find accurate information.
I'd recommend this book to anyone
