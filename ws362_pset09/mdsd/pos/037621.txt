This was my first Jack Ketchum book.  I really liked his style of witing and plan to read more of his books, but jeez this book was brutal.  I love horror fiction but this was almost too disturbing for me.  This story is about horrific child abuse, and according to the author's notes, it is based on a true story.  I have to admit that I really couldn't put this book down, but it's really rough.  I'd like to comment on the ending as well, but I don't want to spoil it for you.
