The book by Ray B. Parker is great and will keep you glued to your reading seat. All the components to a wonderful serial killer murder mystery with some other side stories that truly add to the overall experience. This was so well written that it shouldn't be any wonder they made it into a TV movie. Tom Selleck played the Chief of police in the small town in Massachusetts. He does a great job of making the character believable. The support cast was good too. The directing, sets, and music made it an above par TV movie. I hope to see this out on DVD
