First, a disclaimer.  The author and I know each other.  Both of our wives were diagnosed with breast cancer in  about the same time frame.  We were intereviewed for the book.  By the time the book came out, my wife had "finsihed" her course of treatment so much of what is in the book I had to learn on my own. 

The day after we got the diagnosis, I found myself standing in front of the "disease" section at one of the local book store chains.  I didn't know exactly what I was looking for at first.  My original purchase of about a half dozen books were either very focused on the medical aspects of the disease or on women's experiences as survivors.  While one or two of these books had parts of chapters for husbands, partners or significant others, none gave much information on what to expect and how to help.  Ultimately, I sought out a therapist who specialized in helping those who deal with medical crises.    

That helped a great deal, but Marc's book offers so much more.  He is recounts the experiences of couples from almost every part of society, shares insights from medical experts and relates his own personal experiences. While no substitute for working with a qualified and caring therapist, his book is one of the only resources out there for husbands.  Had it been available three years ago, I suspect I could have avoided some of the mistakes I made along the way.

While it is true that the learning curve is pretty steep, the first few weeks are crucial.  No husband should leave the first appointment with the surgeon or oncologist without a copy of this book.
