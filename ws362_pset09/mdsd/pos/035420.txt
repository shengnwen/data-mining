As the groom-to-be, I originally was not as interested in reading books about wedding planning as my wife.  After hearing way too many times that I was not helping enough with the wedding planning and decision making, I started paging through this book.  I quickly became engrossed in the book and soon found myself becoming more involved in helping with the planning.  The book is well organized and reads as if the author was speaking to you directly in a casual conversation.  It walks you through the wedding planning from choosing a date and location through writing the thank you notes.  There were very good explanations of the various dress and tuxedo options, which previously all looked the same to me.  I really appreciated the advice on developing the invitee list and dealing with family and in-laws- two of the most stressful parts of the planning process.  I would highly recommend this book to any couple getting ready to tie the knot
