I used this book for Step2 CK. I had about a month to study, and read the book once in the first week and again skimmed it in the last few days. It reads relatively easily - though looks quite dense at first sight. Good charts/graphs. Did pretty well in the end, though don't know if it was the result of this book, Secrets, or the usmleworld qbank. But given the price, I think it's a great investment. Plus, I've heard it's great for Step 3 as well.
