Regardless of what the naysayers on this site postulate, this book is very useful in describing the moors, and their historical legacy. This book deals in specifics, whereas those criticizing this book, is dealing in generalizations.

It's funny how the critics of this book, refer to the moors as "white", when it is convenient, whereas many of their brethren, refer to the moors as a non-white, mixed group, when it suits their racial purposes, by displaying the history of non-white invasions into Europe, and how the steadfast will of the European people eventually staved off such invasion, by reclaiming and conquering their original lands: vis-a-vis the Moors being driven out of Spain, France, etc.

Todays many (not all)Arabs are primarily non-white: they're not pure white, seeing as how many of them, especially the North Africans, possess black genetic strains; which makes the statement that Arabs across the board are categorically white-ludicrous (unless you consider semites, as classically a "white" people). 

Again, this book is brilliant in its' documentation of the Moors, and their racial make-up, and those that oppose it, only wish that what they were saying was the truth, as opposed to how it really was-and what they probably don't want to believe
