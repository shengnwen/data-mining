this is NOT a book about baseball. i guess that's a bit misleading, because it does have a lot to do WITH baseball, but no, that's not what this book is ultimately about. this book is about courage, love, hate, determination, gratitude, loss, rebirth, frustration, jubilation, segregation, acceptance, family. i could go on. at it's core, it's a book about life. and if you pass this one by, you are missing a real treat.
