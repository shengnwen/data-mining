This is the first entry in the Joe Leaphorn Novels by Tony Hillerman.  I prefer to start series at the beginning, however, I started this series with the Sinister Pig.  That book was very enjoyable, so I started at the beginning with this novel, The Blessing Way.  

First things first.  This novel is not great based on the mystery plot at its center.  What gives this novel its "great" status is the way in which it introduces the uninitiated to the Navajo Way.  This book made for a very enjoyable read.  Although it certainly lacked the complexity of a John Dunning novel, or the eloquence of an Elizabeth George novel, it did stand out on its very own merits.  Hillerman does an excellent job of describing the dry and arid landscape.  He paints an excellent picture.  I was also impressed with the tension in one of the chapters in which the suspense was riveted up a couple of notches.

This book was a great first in this series.  I look forward to the rest.
