This book beautifully captures the heart and soul of what Negro League baseball was. Not only does this book give real insight into what the game meant to black players and fans, but helps one understand how the  alienation of blacks from big-league play was a great tragedy to the game.  This book makes me wonder how great the game could be today, if this  tragedy had not occurred
