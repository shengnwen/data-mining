I first stumbled across this book when I was trying to learn to make a pie crust.  I had tried everything from the little sticks to the frozen crusts, and nothing came out the way I wanted it.  I found this cookbook on a shelf in the used book store, and liked the way the instructions were written.  I tried the pie crust instructions inside the book cover and was delighted with the results.

Try anything in this book, from the maple pecan pie to the chocolate tea bread to the snickerdoodle cookies, and I think you will find the instructions simple, straightforward and easy to follow, resulting in a  pastry you can be proud to serve to anyone
