At first I didn't want to read a book about someone on death row but I figured, it's John Grisham it will probably be good and it is. 

This books is not an action packed book like some of his others, the Pelican Brief, The Firm or Runaway Jury but it is thoroughly interesting. 

It takes this KKK member named Sam Cayhill who is on death row and talks about his life and how he got there. It's really quite a sad story for not only him and his victims but also his family who has been torn apart because of his actions, those that have left him on death row and some of those that did not. 

It's really quite moving reading about the emotions that come to everyone involved when someone is about to be gassed etc and John Grisham does a wonderful job slowly leading you to that point.

This book might not change your opinion on the death penalty but it will definitely let you look at it differently through the eyes of a prisioner and his family etc. 

A good read for those who have time for a slower paced book that leads to a purpose. If you need nonstop action in a book then this is not the one to pick up.
