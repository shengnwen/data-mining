James Chance writes an information packed book that is a readable history of the events leading up to 1912. I read some of the other readers comments and wishes that Chance had these insights in his book. While Chance claims the rift of the 1912 election never healed in the Republican Party -well I don't think any serious historian would say that .Teddy Roosevelt was an interventionist and Taft a conservative probusiness candidate. Our current President -GW Bush is as conservative as Taft but is an interventionist in the Wilson/ Roosevelt traditon. So one can argue the election of GW Bush has healed this alleged rift.
Also as one reader noted it would have been intersting if Teddy Roosevelt confronted the Kaiser and Germany and not Wilson. Again this book is supportive of the modern viewpoint of the Wilson presidency.( Why did we elect that guy ?)
The part about Debs is interesting and it was never clear in my mind why liberals like Wilson saw it fit to inprison Debs while conservatives as President Harding saw fit to pardon him. This aspect could have been flush out more (e.g Were liberals threatened by Debs and Socialism)
Since that election gave us Wilson and the League of Nations that begat the Second World War, one could argue that indeed 1912 was a pivotal year. However Chance does not make this point but instead talks about the Wilson leagacy of Bill Clinton (!) and the alleged 90 year rift of the Republican Party
