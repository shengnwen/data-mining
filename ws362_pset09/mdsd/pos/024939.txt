Dido Twite, the quick-witted (and sharp-tongued) heroine of &quot;Black Hearts in Battersea&quot; and &quot;Nightbirds on Nantucket,&quot; is back  in this sequel. During the mythical reign of Britain's King George IV, the  ship carrying 12-year-old Dido  from Nantucket back to England is ordered  to stop off in New Cumbria, a mysterious South American nation ruled by a  suspiciously ancient queen. Is she, as she claims, the widow of King  Arthur? If so, how has she managed to survive the centuries?  And why  aren't there any girls Dido's age in the entire country? For that matter,  why did the midshipman of Dido's vessel take ill as soon as they arrived in  port? With the same entertaining blend of Cockney common sense and sheer  gutsiness that saw her through her earlier adventures, Dido manages to get  to the bottom of things--saving an imprisoned princess and, yes, restoring  a &quot;stolen&quot; lake in the bargain. All in all, a fun, fast,  rollicking read for youngsters and adults alike
