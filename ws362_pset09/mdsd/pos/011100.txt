Although I remember learning about the ideals of American's founders when I was in elementary school, it seems that children are no longer learning what Thom Hartmann so perfectly conveys in his book.  This book should be required reading for every new citizen and for every new voter (as well as for a few million voters who seem to have forgotten what they learned in school).
