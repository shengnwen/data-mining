I enjoyed this book but, it got to be a little confusing.  It is definitely a book you need to sit and read as much as possible. Or just remember all that has happened.  This is why I gave it four stars.  I read it in a few months because I only read during breaks at work.  So when the end came and brought it all togethter for me I realized it was worth the read.  I don't need to tell you what it's about because Amazon has done it well.  I think it should be read because of the metaphors that are all over this book.  It has a love story mixed within a suspense novel.  Thank you for Craig deciding to still write
