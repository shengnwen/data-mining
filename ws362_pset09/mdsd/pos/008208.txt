It's bizarre that Yoda the Jedi master actually spouted some basic Buddhist wisdom: &quot;...always dreaming of the future, never his mind on WHERE HE WAS! Humph! WHAT HE WAS DOING!&quot; Those words sum up the idea of living in the present moment that is one of the fundamental teachings of Buddhism. This book presents small sayings (or &quot;gathas&quot;) that can be used to allay a distraction and get back into the present moment. There are verses for opening a window, looking in the mirror, using the toilet, getting dressed, lighting a candle, sweeping, eating, walking, gardening, taking out the garbage, using the telephone, and even watching television. All gathas emphasize the interconnectedness of things, and living in the present moment: &quot;We can be very happy just by being aware of what is in front of us.&quot; Themes of justice and injustice also permeate the section on food. This is a very good small, readable and comprehensible collection of Buddhist wisdom. Newcomers may have a little trouble, but the text is not very difficult, and unknown terms can be easily looked up. Buddhism incorporates very underrated perspectives and lifestyles that can reduce stress, conquer anger, and give meaning to daily existence
