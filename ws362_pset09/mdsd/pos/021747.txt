This was a fun business story told with unusual finesse by Jerry Kaplan.  Kaplan has an eye for detail that can make negotiations and other business meetings come alive.  

The plot tells the story of a high profile venture in the late 90s, Go Inc., from inspiration through fund raising and product development to fame, near success and ultimate failure.  Anyone who may have thought about starting a new venture who wants to sit in the passenger seat and observe the whole ride in detail (though not too much detail -- it's an easy read) will enjoy.  I wouldn't say the book is highly educational in a process sense (how to do this, how to do that...), but it does give a lot of high level insight into the difficult tradeoffs and predatory practices that can be confronted in trying to grow a business in high tech.  I read it in a few days and enjoyed it thoroughly.
