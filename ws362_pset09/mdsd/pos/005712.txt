As a survivor of hidden government experiments and an investigator of what is hidden behind the scenes, I have to recommend this book to everyone serious about discovering and acknowledging truth. Kudos to the authors for a brave stand. When the populace is willing to see whether or not the emperor has clothes, books like this will be a formidable tool in rebuilding a truly free democracy.
