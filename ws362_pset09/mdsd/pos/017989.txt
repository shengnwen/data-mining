This book is GREAT!  My 5 year old daughters learned how to tie with the bunny ears method in about an hour.  I worked with them and they just sat down and practiced.  The laces being are two different colors so it really makes it easy to use.  It is a board book so very durable and has detailed directions with pictures to explain how each way to tie works.  I highly recommend this book
