Art and Physics intrigues from the beginning when the three concepts of space, time and light are introduced - - obviously subjects basic to both art and physics.  The common thread the author has identified in these disciplines may not be apparent to a reader devoted to one or the other.  A humane observer discovers the commonality.  He further breaks out beyond the concepts of cause and effect, beyond gravitational pull, beyond linear time/mind, beyond all the dualistic traps that still retain most of our mundane "realities."  His insight into the message of artistic imagery is bold and reflective.  C. G. Jung would have applauded this book for its synthesis of image and empiricism.  Seeing what Monet did to dissolve time, what Manet did to free space, what Pollock did to crack open the void where inspiration enters - - these are lasting new views of the power and message of artistic image.  Science has been our myth of meaning.  From Plato to Euclid to Einstein and Bohr, the pull of discovery becomes clearly singular - - the "uni" in universe. The timeliness of  Dr. Shlain's premise lies in the urgent search for balance by anyone skewed in the conflict of apparent opposites.  It is restorative to read the examples of holistic, all-at-once knowing which is the healing balm for Western culture as our old dominant fades.  The book reminds us of the dimension and direction to which we are called.  How sensible to be oneself in the fullest as Leonardo was Leonardo and Dr. Shlain is Dr. Shlain. It is encouraging to see that this book is assigned in high schools and colleges where young minds will, no doubt, be quick to grasp its profound implication
