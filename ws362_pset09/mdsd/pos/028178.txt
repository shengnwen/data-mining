Another book that I enjoyed.

Si the sarcastic, fashion forward gay guy.
Josh the practical, level headed guy, who had always been in love with Portia, but is married now to Lucy.
Lucy the wife, fabulous chef, and friendly, charming woman.
Catherine the main character who is deeply in love with all her friends, thus shunning men from her life.  She is a victim of fashion (wearing all black) according to Si.
Portia the woman who the above, minus Lucy, all went to college with.  She's sexy, semi famous, and coming back into their lives.

They all adored Portia, but one night broke their friendship, and it's been 10 years since they have seen or talked to her.  But upon meeting a man who just sold his apartment to Portia, everyone is thinking about her.  And upon a phone call, and a chance meeting everything seems to become a little chaotic.  While Portia's role in this book is rather limited, the author makes her seem to be the force of change.  But change begins before Portia steps into the picture as Lucy and Cat start a bookstore/café.  This is a funny, sweet, sad story about a group of friends, most who have stayed in each others lives for years and the changes that they are now going through.  There are a variety of other characters as well, Will, Si's "prick" of a boyfriend, Ingrid the nanny of Lucy and Josh's "devil spawn" of a child (Max), and James the real estate agent who's interested in Cat.  It's a story that actually moves; and the characters each go through some sort of development and issue which they overcome (in a good way).  It's amusing, charming and a good read
