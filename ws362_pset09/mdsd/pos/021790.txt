I've been looking for this sort of book.  I'm just starting to get into building, and this book offers excellent step-by-step instructions for building a steel-string or classical guitar from scratch.  It definitely leans toward traditional methods, which i like a lot.  For example, there is little discussion of spraying finishes, but a lengthy description of the technique of flowing lacquer with a brush.  Lots of good pictures and diagrams, and the text is well-written and very understandable to someone with a basic working knowledge of guitar construction.  Highly recommended
