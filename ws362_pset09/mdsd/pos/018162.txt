I love Lorraine Heath. Its hard to find another author that can create such tender, masculine heroes. Wow, Clay really is perfectly suited to this role. He was so sweet and unsure, yet undeniably masculine. I adored him. I enjoyed Meg as well... but Clay, to me, was the main attraction here. This is a quietly romantic book. It doesnt hit you over the head ,but sneaks up on you and worms its way in until you cant set it down. It is full of some of the sweetest, smallest, most genuine moments. I cant tell you how much I enjoyed this and I highly recommnd it
