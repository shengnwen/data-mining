A great book of short stories by a great New Zealander author who is widely unknown. Her short stories will touch your life! Reading closely, I could find the nature of human being. I was almost overwhelmed. Her  expressing skill is very outstanding. Specifically, I recommend &quot;The  Garden Party&quot; and &quot;The Doll's House&quot; to you
