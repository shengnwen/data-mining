I think this book was great.  It gave me ways and ideas i never thought I would come across.  I was never a sad person, but this book showed me how I can be at my happiest.  Personally, I think that everyone should read this book, whether they are depressed or easy going.  If you're depressed, I am sure it can help you in some way.  In my case, I am a pritty easy going person, and it still helped me.  You don't have to be sad or depressed in order to read this book.

Another reason I really enjoyed this book was becasue it is cheap.  It is only about $9.00, and being a college student we don't exactly have much money to be spending.  The manin reason I enjoyed this book was because it taught me how to deal with everyday situations.  It also dealt with a lot of situations dealing with tie and stress.  I'll be the first to say it, college is very stressful and time consuming.  Overall, it helped me with my transition from highschool to college.
