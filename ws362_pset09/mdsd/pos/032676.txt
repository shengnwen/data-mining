While everyone knows something of the Nazi medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners, I did not appreciate the extent to which other areas of science were twisted and corrupted to serve Nazi ideology.  It's sad to see the extent to which presumably intelligent people, professionals in their field, abandoned all the rigors of logic and the scientific method to satisfy their own preconceptions.  "The Master Plan" is a fresh perspective on the Nazi abuse of science (especially archeology) in the furtherance of their favored (and, for the most part, bizarre) racial and historical theories.  This is the only study of the Ahnenerbe (the elite Nazi research institute created by Himmler) that I've ever seen.  The writing is a touch dry but the subject matter is compelling.  Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the Nazi period
