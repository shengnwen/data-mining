I thought this was an outstanding dual biography of Dr Johnson and James Boswell.  I marveled continuously at how carefully and thoughtfully Sisman describes the selvages and biases of the cloth of these two writers' lives without unraveling them.  The writing itself is exemplary.  Sisman's book, along with Tomalin's biography of Pepys, are among the best biographies in recent memory
