Chesterton, the master of paradox, hits his stride in this dream of paranoia.  For those of you who like your thrillers to pack their punches in terms of caliber, pints of blood shed, or body-count, you can all sod off.  This is a thriller for the mind and the soul -- its aim is to save you from yourselves.  

If you want your English simple, straighforward, fed to you in easy subject-verb-object format, leave as well.  This is more post-modern than any of those douchebags you've been fed in your graduate classes at U.C. Santa Barbara.  

If Chesterton is not the greatest modern author, then that is only because T.S. Eliot or Evelyn Waugh is slightly better.  

The chief pity is that Americans -- most direly in need of this sort of instruction -- will not read this work
