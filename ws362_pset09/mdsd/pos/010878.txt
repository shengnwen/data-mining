I found this book to be a great resource for a first time mom.  Not only does it give a general idea of the things your baby may be doing at different times it also gives suggestions of fun games to play every week.  Since I never spent a lot of time around very young babies this really helped me to figure out which games were best to play at which stages and gave me some great ideas when I was running out of new ways to entertain my son.  It also had some special notes that highlight where premature babies may fall developmentally at different times.

I know this book may rub some breastfeeding mothers the wrong way but I was not bothered by it.  As the breastfeeding mother of a 5 month old I felt that it highlights the importance of breastfeeding but also supports the decisions of formula feeding moms or moms who find it necessary to wean to formula.  There is even a section with tips on weaning from the breast to formula at 6 months which I found refreshing and guilt-free in comparison to other books.

Some of the advice is not the best but as with any parenting book use your own judgment before using any book as your bible
