I don't read a lot of thrillers and even more rarely anything with a political bent--but Lawson actually avoids politics and focuses on storyline and the mystery.  His tough guy isn't typical either--he doesn't smoke cigars and fall into bed drunk every night.  

Unlike a few other commenters, I found the sidekick characters fully developed and enjoyable--no cookie cutters here. Emma, especially, has her own interesting story, and Lawson does a good job of telling it without letting Emma take over the story. I also found the main character intriguing with hints of past, unwanted ties to the mafia, and family troubles making the guy very human.

The story starts out with a bang, slows for the introduction of the characters, then begins the tangle of mystery.  It all comes together nicely in the end.  Any violence is handled without gore and showmanship.

This is a good weekend read, quick and interesting
