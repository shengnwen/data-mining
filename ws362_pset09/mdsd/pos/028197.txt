This is an important work of philosophy, but it's probably a mistake to look in it for a statement about the nature of thought.  Rather, Heidegger seeks to open up thinking, for himself and for the reader (originally the listeners of this lecture course).  The questions he asks are as important, if not more so, as any potential answers.  And as with almost all works of Heidegger after Being and Time, Heidegger's writing constitutes a kind of performance which fends off easy, facile conclusions.  Objections to the idiosyncracies of his style fail to recognize that Heidegger's style is inseperable from the sort of open-ended thinking he promotes.  Of all the many questions he asks, the most important is, &quot;What calls for thinking?&quot;  We do not simply decide to think, according to Heidegger, but rather Being, the Being of beings, calls on us to think, and thereby realizes itself through our thinking.  To read Heidegger is to step back from your everyday, taken-for-granted assumptions and thereby create a space for reflection.  And this, as he says, is a gift
