There's a bat in bunk five is now my new favorite book!!! after i read it i wanted to go to summer camp so badly!  The book talks about a 15 year old girl who goes to camp, gets a boyfriend, and has a fun time! you can see how it's like to care for a lot of children at one time.  The reading level of this book was pretty easy. Even though it was a fairly short book, it was really good
