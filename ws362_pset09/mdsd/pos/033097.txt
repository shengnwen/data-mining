For someone new to the game, this book is fantastic.  Very few instructional volumes will successfully tell you how a particular technique -feels-.  The examples start with the grip, in which the illustrations show you (and the text accurately describes) precisely what it is that you're searching for in terms of hand contact with the club.  Pictures are helpful, but they can't convey the less tangible feelings of swinging or holding the club properly.  It's not a substitute for lessons by any means, but it is a good (and short) way to get yourself planted on the right track towards hitting the ball well consistently
