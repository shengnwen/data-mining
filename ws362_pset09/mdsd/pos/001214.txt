So, what do you get? (This is a description of the hardcover edition)

It's a nice solid book, well bound, quite thick (700 plus pages) that makes a good gift. The cover is colorful, and it looks like it'll last for years, even with a bit of mishandling from kids.

You get all of the L. Frank Baum "Oz" stories, except for a few really obscure short stories that were published in the newspapers, where the Wogglebug from "Oz" visits the USA.

The text is printed in two columns, but it's not hard to read - from looking at 'search-inside-the-book', it looks like the hardback is a bit easier to read than the paperback. There aren't any illustrations though.

For a kid who liked the first Oz book and wants to read the others, it's a lot cheaper than buying them all separately!

On balance, recommended, but it looks like it's worth getting the hardcover rather than the paperback.
