I got this book as a Christmas gift, and I approached it with kneejerk Deadhead prejudices (fueled by some of the reviews here, I must admit.) I was pleasantly surprised. 

One criticism I share: I don't think that Ms. Brightman's activist past and her insights about it are interesting enough to stand alone in the market.

I was intrigued by what she has to say about the spiritual aspects of the Dead experience. It seems to me that she understands and respects certain facets of the experience that most outsiders don't. It is equally clear that she doesn't really "get it."
