This novel was first published in 1842, and various editions are available.  While the author is noted more for other novels, he started his career at sea, sailing as a merchant seaman for two years from 1806 to 1807, then becoming a midshipman in the United States Navy, serving for two years before resigning his commission to stay on land.  He maintained his interest in the sea and is credited with writing the first sea novels.  He lived in Italy from 1828 to 1829, primarily in Naples, but visiting Elba and other areas.  He was intimately familiar with the actions and settings used in the novel, which is set in 1799 in and around the Bay of Naples, the Isle of Capri, and Elba.

The title of the novel is explained in the first chapter when a suspiciou lugger is seen approaching Elba, "the spread of her canvas, as she came down before the wind, wing-and-wing, as seamen term it, or with a sail fanning like the heavy pinions of a seafowl, on each side..."  When the lugger arrives at Elba, it displays and English flag, and the Captain identifies himself as Jack Smith and the lugger as the Wing-and-Wing.  In actual fact, the captain is Raoul Yvard and the lugger is the French corsair Feu-Follet.  Raoul has come to Elba to meet Ghita, the woman he loves.

The story proceeds as the Feu-Follet plays a game of cat-and-mouse with the British frigate Proserpine commanded by Captain Cuffe.  Part of the story is the action between the Feu-Follet and the British, and part of the story is the relationship between Raoul and Ghita.  There is a large cast of characters involved.

The story is slow reading, as Cooper was very descriptive of both the settings and the events, and included long conversations between the characters.  It is worth reading both as classic literature (one of the first sea novels) and to obtain another side of Cooper's novels
