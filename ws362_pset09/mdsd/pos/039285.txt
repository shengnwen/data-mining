I am studying palmistry and contrary to what another reader has said, I have found it the easiest book yet to learn from. This is because it is written in a way that makes the information easy to absorb and remember, rather than just lists of points, and I am actually managing to remember it all very well. It also is written in a way that is designed especially for someone who is seriously trying to learn and not just for fun, so I think its excellent.
