Okay, so I get hung up on odd things when I approach such a book.  How  shall I read it? being the major thing.  That is, do I want to read the  introduction before or after I read the body of the work, and, more  importantly, do I want to read the entire David story and then read the  commentary, referring as needed to the story,  or do I want to read the bit  of story and the commentary on it on page 234 before I go on to the bit of  story and the commentary on page 235.   Well, even though I've tasted it  more times than I can count, I read the story first.  After all, I know the  story will be my favorite part  -- and why should I deprive myself.  A rip  roaring good story it is, too, the kind of story that lasts because no  matter who you are or how you read,  whether your bent is religious,  historical, or literary, whether you think the material came down untouched  to the present day or whether you think someone went back and added all the  boring stuff,  the story can stand up to the interpretation.   As for the  commentary,  Alter is best when he talks literary, when he shows the  the  insight, choices, the shaping, the devices, the vision  that mark the David  story a work of literary art
