In "The Kill Artist" Daniel Silva introduces readers to Gabriel Allon, a retired Mossad Secret agent.  I admit I have read Gabriel Allon books out of order. This was my third Gabriel Allon book, but "The Kill Artist" is the first in the series.  Silva is worth reading for several reasons. His European and Middle Eastern settings are extremely well researched an accurate. He does not just set his scenes in the most well known and popular areas of Israel, London, or Germany, but in the ethnic suburbs, run-down areas, and other lesser known regions.  This gives the book a real authentic feel. 

The author appears to have more than a passing knowledge of Israeli intelligence operations.  My guess is that he has several friends/contacts who "advice" him on tactical details.  The story of the reluctant Jewish fashion model turned operative was interesting enough to be spun off into its own novel.

Gabriel Allon is a deep and very human character, despite being an assassin.  The art restorer/master assassin combination is great.  My only complaint is that I wish we could see a plot line that does not just end up in an epic showdown between two master assassins fighting to the death.  There is more to intelligence operations that just assassinations.  Despite this minor issue, I look forward to working my way through Silva's other Gabriel Allon novels.
