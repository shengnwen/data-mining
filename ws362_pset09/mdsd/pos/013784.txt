I would categorize this book less as politics and current affairs and more as a complete sociological analysis of contemporary Spanish society.  The author covers all aspects of modern Spain including its politics, economy, demographics, education, housing, labor, family, religion, and popular culture. The author explains the changes over the past 25 years from the ossified Franco regime to the modern nation involved politically,economically, and socially with the rest of Europe and the world.  Very well written and organized with insightful analysis and illuminating explanation of Spanish society and mores
