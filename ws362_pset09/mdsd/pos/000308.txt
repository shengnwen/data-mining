I've just got done reading Shutter Island the second time this morning. Obviously, the first reading impressed me enough to warrant a second read. The first reading must have had me completely engrossed because I did not guess what was going on right up to the end. I found the characters interesting and fully fleshed out. They needed to be to make sense of patient's paranoid delusions. In Terry's delusional state, none of the medical or nursing staff are what he believes them to be.

Anyway, I swallowed my first reading hook, line, and sinker. Yeah, I thought it was a little weird when Teddy's partner Chuck disappeared and the guards made such a big deal about preventing a U.S. Marshall from leaving the island. But I bought it until the end and found the story very compelling. This is obvious, since I just got done rereading the book.

Reading a book like this - even a couple years apart - allows for a whole different perspective when reviewing the book. I had remembered the gist of the story but not the details. During the second read I started to pick up on more clues that made the ending more expected and lead me to more criticisms of the book.

While reading the negative reviews (mostly two or three sentence reviews, most of which had been written by readers who didn't even finish the book for various reasons), I kept a list of the most common complaints. Here they are in no particular order:
*	Comparison to the Sixth Sense - these stories have little in common. The Sixth Sense had to do with communication with the dead - actual communication between a boy and ghost.
*	Shutter Island has no references to the supernatural. Instead it deals with an individual who is delusional (fabricating an entirely new reality) and a paranoid schizophrenic. 
*	Confusing story - I found the storyline easy to follow and each character was distinct up until the final part of the book when Teddy moves from a rational state back to a delusional persona and we have to change our perceptions of who's who.
*	Storyline difficult to follow. I realize that words of more that five or six letters can confuse some people, making it more difficult to understand the book. This is a common complaint when books have many characters and locations. The only problem I had was trying to envision the landscape that Terry was describing.
*	No idea what was going on. This I find difficult to understand. It was an easy read, taking me two days to complete. The story was fairly chronological with the exception of Teddy's flashbacks regarding the war and his life with his wife. Once the reader realizes that pretty much everything that involves Terry directly is part of his delusions and his inability to deal with the harrowing fact that his wife killed their three children and then he, in turn, killed her, makes things a little more clearer.
*	For some reason unknown to me, a reviewer (giving one *) had a problem with the use of plastic in the novel. I'm in the dark here. I don't have any specific recollection of plastic being used. I guess that whatever the reviewer was complaining about had much to do with the fact that the year is only 1954. Well, plastics have been around since the 1800s so I don't imagine their use (in whatever capacity) to be that farfetched.
*	Another criticism was that prison locks controlled by electricity were not in use in 1954 is not something that I have been able to confirm or deny. Even today, some penitentiaries still use the old lock and key method. I don't know when electrical security systems came into place and who cares anyway.
*	Many people gave negative reviews based on the fact that Shutter Island was so different from the author's other books. I had never read any of Lehane's other books so this had no influence on me as I read this book.

One criticism that I have to agree with (and I even felt a little uncomfortable about this with the first read) is that Teddy/Andrew was given full run of the entire island only to prove to one set of doctors that this inmate could be cured of his delusions and violent proclivities. What were these doctors' thinking?  I realize that they were willing to try anything to save their patient from more radical (psychosurgical) intervention. But this was a really unethical way to go about doing it. It placed in danger the staff, other inmates (especially taking into the account the history of his violent behavior a couple weeks before the experiment), and to the subject himself. This guy was psychotic, delusional, and possibly a paranoid schizophrenic - they just don't snap out of it. Maybe this was not fully understood in 1954 but these conditions are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, just as diabetes is caused the body's inability to produce enough insulin.

In 1954, the evil doctors waiting for Crawley's experiment to fail planned to subdue Teddy/Andrew with the immoral, unethical, and unproved treatment by transorbital lobotomy. Fortunately, this type of psychosurgery is not longer accepted
