This book was one of the most entertaining I have picked up an a long while.  From the beginning, I was drawn into the story of the young man, who in my opinion, had an old soul.  His constant struggles and his continual attempts to overcome them had me feeling what he was feeling.  I was so angry at one point in the book, I wanted to rewrite what was happening.  It is not often that I am so drawn into a book written for chidren.  This is a wonderful text that I plan on integrating into 4th and 5th grade classrooms, as I feel that students, especially young males, can identify with the struggles the young man went through.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves to be drawn into a fantastic adventure story adn who likes to see good conquer all
