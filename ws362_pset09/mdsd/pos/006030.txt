As an artist who paints buildings and landmarks, this book has been the  answer to my prayers.  In the past, it has been a trial and error effort to  create realistic looking bricks, stones and other building parts without  any real quide to teach me.  This book included solutions for every texture  I've tried to create and saved me valuble time with step by step  instructions and examples. I recommend this as a guide for every artist  whether beginning or advanced that wants to paint buildings
