The Power Peek makes Astrology easy to understand and use.  I love that this book is not preachy or uppity.  It has spiritual concepts but they are presented in a way that we can all relate to. Mr. Husson has a great sense of humor and it's refreshing to come across someone in this field who's not taking him or herself too seriously.

This book will help you make sense of the many ups and downs we all experience.  It also helps remind me not to take it so personally.

Love it
