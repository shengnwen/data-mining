It is true that the beginning of this historical adventure is slow and surprisingly sketchy in places - the first attack of the local tribesmen on the fort at Isca Dumnoniorum (sp?) has a great build-up, but is over in a matter of sentences, with no mention of blood or wounds or casualties - and a good third of the book is really construction and mood-setting, before the main plot truly begins.

It is also true that the plot is a pleasing and gripping quest of young heroes seeking a lost relic (a Roman Eagle) in enemy territory. It's based on true events (more so than, say, the abominable Clive Owen King Arthur film) and the author's mastery of period detail keeps the story feeling real and well-rooted, without ever overwhelming the narrative in senseless trivia.

Rosemary Sutcliff could be compared to Richard Adams in her evocative descriptions of nature and environment. This is true as well.

But nothing in the novel rings more true than one scene, late in the tale, when one of our heroes' allies, a shaggy old wildman of the British tribes remembers, just for an instant, the Roman Centurion he was in youth, and snaps to a parade-perfect salute as he bids them farewell, and is lost in the morning mist. The poignancy of the moment brought tears to my eyes.

This is the truth
