This tribute to Dr. Geisler is a worthwhile read as "a case for the Christian worldview" is provided. Articles by such people as Gary Habermas, William Lane Craig, and others were very interesting and educational. I especially liked the chapter written by Greg Koukl as being the most applicable to apologetics, as he showed how to "apply apologetics to everyday life." Several of the articles were a little wordy and could have been much simplified, meaning that some laypersons may get easily bored. But overall, I think the book did its job
