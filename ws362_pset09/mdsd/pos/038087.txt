A must have. I was wavering between being very interesting and not so much so for the first 150 pages or so. After that, not even sleep could keep me away from this book. Too excellent to be true. I am hooked badly. I am also waiting quite impatiently for the next book in this trilogy, the title promises much. Just buy it and read it and you'll see for yourself. These men can't keep their hands off each other
