This was an excellent read. The novel starts with Paris along with his dangerous friend Fearless Jones. Investigates Useless who stores diamonds in his sink. But that just the beginning it seems trouble keeps knocking on Paris Minton door. Until there's a showdown in which when the dust clears. No one is safe. You will enjoyed the different twists and turns. My only problem with novel that there was just too many characters. Some which didn't fit the storyline
