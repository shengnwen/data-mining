I recently used this book as the basis for a graduate/advanced undergraduate seminar in ev psych, and the students loved it.  My initial impression was that it might be too difficult for a first introductory course in the discipline, but the students disagreed strongly.  I now think they're right.  The book has good coverage of the necessary evolutionary theory, a lot of empirical evidence to support its claims, and a balanced and informed inclusion of material from different disciplines.  It is all explained very clearly.  I particularly liked the inclusion of cross-cultural material; a field that is concerned with the universal underpinnings of human cognition, preferences, and social behavior is incomplete unless it is willing to stray from the usual undergraduate subject pool and consider variation in the way these are expressed.  I encourage the authors to revise this book as needed to keep it up-to-date
