This book is great for anyone who is interested in fantasy or Lord of the Rings but doesn't want to take the time in effort to read them.It is also good as a prelude to the series altough I'd recommend the Silmarillion too.It is a short little book about a sensible and yet adventurous Hobbit who goes on an adventure with Gandalf the wizard and a group of dwarves to find a lost treasure guarded by a dragon in a far away land.There are many references to the Lord of the Rings books such as the finding of the Ring and Gollum,Mirkwood and the wood elves(Legolas' kin),and Sauron(the Necromancer).It is a fun book that you can probably finish in a week without too much effort.Not deep like the Lord of the Rings,but fun,active,and adventurous so it's great for kids as well as adults.I was disappointed with the ending,however,because it did seem rather anti-climactic
