This is a great book for anyone who loves the Macintosh or that great phase in the early 80's where microcomputing was all the rage.  The book is mostly text, but the few photos help to illustrate the story.  It's done in journal style, with each entry lasting from one page to about five pages.  This makes it easy to put down, remember your place, and resume from the next entry.
The only negative thing is that it's technical - very technical.  There are times where even myself as a self-confessed computer nerd just found all the information way above my head.  That said, this is only a small portion of the book, and those who are die-hard Mac fans will probably understand everything that is said.
It was exciting to read about how the Mac team gew, how Steve Jobs showed through in his personality, and what little things kept the Mac team going to get out a great product in 1984
