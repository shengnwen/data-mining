While lots of books discuss the technology of service-oriented architecture (SOA), The New Language of Business focuses on the need for business flexibility and how to achieve it with SOA, by applying SOA not only to the IT department but also to the business as a whole. Not only does IT need to align to the business, but the business needs an architecture that IT can align to; this book shows how to use SOA to make that happen.

This book introduces the reader to many important aspects of SOA and shows how to use them to achieve business flexibility: component business modeling, the SOA reference architecture, the SOA lifecycle, SOA governance, and the SOA entry points. This is great information for explaining to the business why SOA matters and what the business (not just IT) needs to do
