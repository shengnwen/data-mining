I really enjoyed the first few books of the Left Behind series, but as the preachiness increased and the quality of the story and writing began to sank, I just couldn't bear continuing to the very end.

But as a stand alone book, it's easy to see why this one was such a bestseller and went on to spawn several more in a series. The characters feel alive and so real; so very human as though their very lives were being recorded down, not invented.

The premise, that of everyone dissapearing in a worldwide rapture, may not be agreed upon by all Christians or biblical scholars but as a plot point in fiction, it works wonders. Just imagine that billions of people dissapear from the earth - would you want to know what happens? What consequences it has on the world in the days, weeks, and months after the event? I know that curiosity is certainly what got me to pick this one up, and it definately delivers.

I also recommend reading the sequal and the third book too, because by then I'm sure you'll have made your mind up on whether 'Left Behind' is "your thing" or not
