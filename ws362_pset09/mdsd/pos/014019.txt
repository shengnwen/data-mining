Exellently written and excellent information.The best thing about this book is that I didn't really need to read it at all!.But most people from CEO's to students do need to read it.I'm not sure that most people can learn from this book as it promotes a mind set you almost need to be born with,and that school,work and society generally try to crush out of you,as the author points out,yet the premise of this book is totally correct,innovation is the only competitive advantage left to leverage in the modern world,or soon will be.The authors writing style is engaging and motivating,it is no B.S.,no punches pulled,straight to the often humourous point.It is skillfully written to get a serious point across in a friendly way.Even though not stated directly,the thing needed in business as well as your personal life is empathy,to customers,employees,to your own coming obsolesence,to new idea's,and death to sentimentality for what worked in the past,thing's most people seem to lack,things the education system aims at crushing.This book attempts to prise open closed minds,it has all the right ingredients,but I can only wish the author good luck in suceeding in getting the message across to the majority.Judging by other reviews its not yet working,people still don't get it.The cynical side of me see's this book as a well crafted introduction to,and motivation to hire the authors consulting firm,but frankly most people will need more help than any book can offer.If you already get it,this book is well articulated and should help you see your own nature better,and give you the confidence to keep conflicting with others and refusing to comform,if you don't get it then this is a good introduction into an open mind and some empathy rather than mindless conformity to old mindless conformity ways of doing things
