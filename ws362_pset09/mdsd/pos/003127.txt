Satirical.  Sarcastic.  Ironic.  Humorous.  Salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life.  This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life.  The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield.  He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home.  In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life.  One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps.  As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him.  Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness.  But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad.  Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends.  When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything.  Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all.  As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets
