Bobby Sands, equipped with only a contraband ballpoint pen refill cartridge and toilet paper, wrote some of the most affecting and powerful poetry of this century.  His prison diaries give poignant insight into the soul of a man who was willing to die for his beliefs. In this case, the right to be treated as a human being.  Regardless of your political  perspective, this is a book that should be experienced to gain a greater understanding of the complex politics that led to 10 men dying on hunger strike.

There is a good reason that Nobel Peace Laureate Sean MacBride wrote the introduction to this book.  It deserves to be read by anyone who cares about the Troubles in the North of Ireland.   Indeed, it deserves to be read by anyone with a love of the indomitable human spirit, of which Bobby Sands was one.  

Rest in Peace, Bobby
