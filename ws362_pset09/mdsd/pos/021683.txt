I've been a fan of Boris Vallejo since the late 70's. He was a major inspiration for me in my own artistic aspirations. Say what you want about his composition or subject matter but you can't deny that he is the undisputed master of his technique. His wife, Julie Bell's style is almost indistinguishable from Vallejo's but she has mastered Boris' painting techniques with enough expert panache to make them her own. Although I wish there was more emphasis on Boris' earlier work, this book is a beautiful compilation of some of Vallejo and Bell's best work. The print quality of some Boris' classic pieces is below par for this type of book, but overall this is a must for longtime fans and newcomers alike
