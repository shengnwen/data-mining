Some editions (in fact, most of them) do not tell you that this is actually the third in a series of books about the character Mitch Rapp. I was not aware that this was a series until they made numerous references to previous activities. Flynn tries to catch the reader up, but it mostly ends up as a blur to the uninitiated reader.

That being said, this was a decent thriller. Undoubtedly, I would have enjoyed it more if I had known all of the backrground, but it still got the job done. I kept turning the pages and the ending , while frustrating to some, seemed to be more appropriate than if Flynn had wrapped everything up in a nice package.

I give this one a grade of B
