- Consists mainly of photos of the sets during production.
- 90% of the pictures I have never seen before in other Star Wars production-based books. It just goes to show how tightly Lucas controls the distribution of Star Wars related pictures- which makes this book a gem.
- Quicktime VR on CD gives you a good sense of just how big and elaborate some of these sets are.
- If you are using a Mac, use Safari to browse the disc. It will eventually pop up with a message where Flash is complaining about permissions. Click the Settings button in the popup- which will take you to an online location on the Macromedia Flash site; and click on "Always Allow" and then Add location. Type a name for the location into the box that appears (like sw disk).
Quit from browser and restart it. Everything should work fine now.

- I tried looking at this book in the bookstore but it is always sealed in plastic wrap. But I am glad to have purchased it
