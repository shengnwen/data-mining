I got this book a long time ago when I was heavily into HP Lovecraft.  Something about HPL's writing strikes a chord - even though it's cheesy, something about it feels TRUE, and that's scary ... so I started chasing down his sources, to read what he had read, in order to make sense of the feelings his writing evokes.  The Golden Bough was the first one I found, probably because it is still widely available and can be found in most bookstores.  HPL always put it on his doomed occultist characters' bookshelves alongside the Necronomicon, "The Witch Cult in Western Europe" (which does exist and can be bought here at Amazon!), and the "Unausprechlichen Kulten" of Von Juntz.
In the "Golden Bough" Sir Frazer takes the basic premise of explaining the strange rite of succession of the priest at Nemi, and uses it as a launch-pad to go into a long, drawn-out discussion of the roots of magic and superstition, and how so-called "primitive" beliefs have been common to all cultures in a certain stage of their development, all over the world.
The subject matter is fascinating, but Frazer's writing style is very dry, very British, very turn-of-the-(20th)century academic ... and he rambles.  Some chapters he seems to be lost on a sidetrack, distracted by the unending cascade of interesting facts and anecdotes, but ultimately he returns to the main idea just when you thought he had lost it forever.  The contrast between the "holy crap" amazement of what he's telling you and the soothing, hypnotic monotone of his written voice actually gives me a strangely pleasant tingling  sensation along my spine after about 15 minutes of reading.
Of course I don't expect everyone (or anyone at all, for that matter) to have such a visceral reaction, but most readers with any interest in the shadowy depths of human thought and spirituality will enjoy this book immensely
