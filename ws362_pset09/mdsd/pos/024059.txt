Katie is such an endearing character. Perhaps because she is the same age as my own daughters, I felt moved to reach out to her and give her some good old-fashioned nurturing and motherly love/guidance. She struck a chord in me as I related very closely to her feelings of trying to fit in, find good solid friendships, despair and loss - and these aren't just from reflections of my own adolscence but from experiences in my current adult life too. 

I can't wait to read True to Form, the last book of this series!
