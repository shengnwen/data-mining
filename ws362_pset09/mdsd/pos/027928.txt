As the years go by, and my range of knowledge grows, I find myself being drawn back again and again to John Donne.  Unlike one of the previous reviewers, I do share his religion and even practice a more modern version of his denomination.  Still there is something more there.  As far as comparing Donne with Eliot, although I think Eliot was a great poet, there is more depth of feeling in Donne's work.  However, one must consider that Eliot put his wife away (literally) when she became an embarassment because her mental problems.  Since these turned out to be hormonally driven, this betrayal is all the more tragic.  Donne, on the other hand, after years of carousing, found his soul mate and his one true love and continued to be devoted to her years after she died.  As great as this love was, his writings show that, although he was afraid to trust the promises made by his God, he loved him even more.  Now, that is devotion and that is the root of wonderful and beautiful thoughts he put to paper
