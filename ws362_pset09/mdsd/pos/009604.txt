The Sign of The Beaver is a good book!  It's about a family that decides to move to the forest!  A boy named Matt and his father and his father set off to the forest leaving a mother who is pregnant and a little girl behind.  The dad would come back and get the girls later.  Once the boys got to the forest, they found a good place and started to build a log cabin.  Once they were done, the father left to get the girls and left Matt behind.  A few days after Matt's dad left, Matt met two Indians.  One was a boy matt's age and one was his grandfather.  Very surprisingly, the grandfather made Matt attempt to teach the boy his age to write.  The Indian's name is Attean.  Matt's attempt to teach him was hard work.  After a while, Matt and Attean became friends.  But will their friendship be strong enough to keep Matt alive?  Will Matt's family be able to make it to the cabin safely?  Read the book to find out!  

	I recommend this book to you because it has lots of adventure.  It is also very exiting and cliff-hanging!
