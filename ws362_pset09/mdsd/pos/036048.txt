Amazon has the age range for this book as 4 to 8 years of age, but truly unless your five or even 6 year old is precocious, I don't think they are going to "get it".  

Certainly my five year old and her friends did not appreciate the clever and sneaky aspects of the soldiers deceit.   And the concepts of war and wariness are thankfully not things they understand either.  

But having said that, I would still purchase this book again.  It's a classic story, one I well remember from my own childhood and I think it deserves a space on almost every child's book shelves though you may have to wait for your child to comprehend what exactly is going on.

Four stars.  For older children it is an excellent and classic story that is fun.  When a child finally teases out what the fuss is all about they will surely have one of those `aha' moments.
