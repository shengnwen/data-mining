This is a very expensive book, although well worth it.  It goes
into factors determining tube lifespan, management of filament
voltages applied to thoriated-tungsten tubes,etc.  A wide variety
of tubes ranging from triods to tetrodes and pentodes were
discussed.  Magnetrons and travelling-wave tubes were also discussed
