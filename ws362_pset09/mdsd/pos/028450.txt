This book is kind of unique since it essentially covers only the last day  or so in Tokyo prior to the surrender by the Japanese government at the end  of the Second World War. Reading about this one day makes it seem like one  of the longest days in history since so much happens: the government trying  to surrender; the emperor under seige by the army; junior officers in the  army trying for a coup d'etat; officers getting murdered; officers  committing suiside. Very much detail and a very clear description of what  happened that day in Japan. Reading this book you get to know the  characters involved and also their personalities. It's almost like reading  a novel. A very powerful one, but a true story. I'd recommend this as MUST  reading for students of the Japanese War. For the general reader it might  be a little too detailed, but it's worth the reading
