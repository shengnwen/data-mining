I bought this edition as a teaching supplement, not realizing that it is the folio version of the play.  The words "quarto" and "folio" refer to the size of the pages in the two editions. Many secondary schools and universities use the quarto edition and a lot is left out of the folio--this version cuts out three hundred lines and adds one hundred new ones.  The effect is that it alters the way the characters are shown.  If you are reading the play with a class and they have a quarto version, while you are using your trusty teacher's Cambridge, chances are there will be a lot of blank expressions and confusion on their faces.  The lines they see will not jibe with yours.  The extra articles and class activities are great though--just make sure that if you use the Cambridge, you have your students buy only folio editions
