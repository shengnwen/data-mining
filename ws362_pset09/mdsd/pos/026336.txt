1 Play and learn all the functions of the 2003 applications.

2 Use MeasureUp practice tests; you can play with all the functions in 2003 using the online version of the MeasureUp practice test if you don't have a copy of the all the 2003 applications.

3 Use the Certiport practice tests, the 2002 versions are just as helpful and seem to be free, so much overlaps.

4 Use this book; I never much used the printed copy, I used the Adobe pdf version that came along with it along with the practice files
