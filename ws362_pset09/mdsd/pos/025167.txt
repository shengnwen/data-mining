A very good work indeed! Shermer has an excellent mind and touches on things I so badly wish the uneducated masses of America could learn. I can't really knock the book, though I think Shermer's topicality could be better. For instance, he could have reserved his chapter on Holocaust Deniers for a separate book and spent more time evaluating and debunking other irrational and publically accepted notions, but still, this work is terrific and a nice, easy read.
