I found this book to be extremely helpful in my situation.  More than once I was amazed to find exactly how I was feeling written in the pages.  I think NOT "Just Friends" is very well written and easy to read.  This book is very helpful in helping to identify and validate all the emotions that surface after an affair discovery. I would recommend it to anyone facing the aftermath of their partner having an affair.
