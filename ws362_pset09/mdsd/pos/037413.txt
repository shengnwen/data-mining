I liked this book because it uses much humor and teaches a valuabe lesson like all the &quot;Wally McDoogle&quot; books. In &quot;Alien Monster Bait,&quot; Wally learns about pride and treating others more special than some people. My favorite part was when Wally got cut out of the film and Opera screamed longer than him.This is a great book- I recommend it for anyone with a sense of humor
