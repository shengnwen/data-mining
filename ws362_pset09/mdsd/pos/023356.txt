Night Shift is a great collection of early horror stories from the master himself.  20 stories in total, most of them great winners. 

Notable standouts include:

Quitters Inc. where a man goes to an agency to quit smoking. The first time he is got caught cheating he gets a warning. The second time he is caught smoking his wife goes missing. You will have to read to find out what happens the third time.

Battleground:  A box of toy soldiers that are more than just plastic. A man rapped in his apartment has to escape, but he is not the type to run away. He would rather fight than flee...

And 16 more...

Anyone who is unsure if they want to become a "King Addict" like me, unwilling to buy a full length novel may want to start with this collection, as they are short stories, but are classic King nonetheless. Be warned however, after reading this great collection, you will likely be hooked on King, and scared for remainder of your life...
