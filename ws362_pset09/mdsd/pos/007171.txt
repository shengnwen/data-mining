Ha, ha. A death ray mounted secretly mounted on a remote mountaintop by an evil genius, a two-fisted protagonist wielding a Buck Rogers blaster, a U.S. Space Command general in blue jumpsuit. Written in a straight-faced tone of voice, though.

But for the fact that it takes place a couple of years in the past, and has comparatively little to do with outer space, this would very well qualify as a classic-type Space Opera.  Kind of a novel-length addition to "A Good Old-Fashioned Future."

Nothing wrong with that, and Sterling has proven to be the BEST current practitioner of that style more than once. I guess the negative reviews are posted by readers who prefer his more "serious" work, but hey, lighten up guys. This one is kind of reminiscent of Stephenson or Blaylock
