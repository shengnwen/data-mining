Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is a great book. The comedy is awesome, but sometimes a little dry, but that's the way British humor is sometimes. The plot is a little confusing at times, but not horribly difficult to follow. The main point is that Richard MacDuff, a software engineer, is at least for a short time, believed to have killed his boss, Gordon Way, who, unknown to anyone, is actually a ghost who is very annoyed at being a ghost. Richard, in his desperation, seeks out a detective, namely, Svlad Cjelli, or Dirk Gently (how Dirk Gently comes from Svlad Cjelli are the same is still a mystery), a detective whose specialties include lost cats and messy divorces. A cornerstone of the agency is the belief in "the interconnectedness of all things" (hence the "Holistic" part of the agency's name), which comes down to somehow having a trip to the Bahamas help find a woman in England's cat. Dirk helps Richard, and in their search to prove his innocence, they uncover a time machine, another ghost, and the true origin of humankind! (which is almost prevented because of the time machine, but Dirk stops it before all of humanity is erased.) 
There are may memorable quotes, somewhat random Samuel Taylor Coleridge references, and generally strange moments, such as a horse appearing in a bathroom at random. This is a really good book, as are most of Douglas Adams's books. Dirk Gently may not be in the tradition of Great Detectives, but this book is in a tradition of great books. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good laugh or just an interesting book
