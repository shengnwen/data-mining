This would be an ideal read for a long plane trip - but warn the people around you that you'll be disturbing them, because it is, literally, laugh-out-loud comedy. The one-liners come almost too thick and fast, and I wondered at first whether the plot was going to be as good. It is. Keenan gets his characters into impossible scrapes and then, deftly, gets them impossibly out again. 

Like most airport novels it has power, wealth and greed, but also comfortably gay characters and gay sex, but all in the best possible taste (no direct references to parts or where they go, and you're warned if you would rather skip it).  

It's a pleasant pastime, during and after reading it, to cast the film. A pity we no longer have Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for the wonderfully out of it Lily. I for one wouldn't cast the obvious youknowho as famous closetcase Stephen - where is a younger Tab Hunter when we need one?

Sadly, like Maupin's "Maybe the Moon", which also wittily skewers Hollywood vanity and power-mongering, it will probably never be filmed, for precisely that reason
