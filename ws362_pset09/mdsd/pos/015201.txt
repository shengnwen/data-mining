This is a book that must be read from beginning to end. It starts off kind of hard to take-- two adults seemingly set on pursuing their own goals, almost selfishly, certainly idealistically and wholeheartedly "90s." Why would anyone care? But as the book progresses,it becomes clear that it's really about the openness to love. And when the husband--at first a very reluctant father-- holds his adoptive daughter Becky in his arms and sings to her, the gap closes, the links forge.  If you're a parent, imagine your child has been lost-- at a beach, an amusement park, a shopping mall-- wouldn't you put aside your own needs and desires and come together with your partner/spouse to find the child? Wouldn't the child become not only the focus but at that moment--and perhaps many others--the single most important thing in your life? I think maybe that's what happened with this couple, and this book is about their journey to that willingness, that openness-- that love. I dunno, but in my humble opinion (and as a mother), I saw this book to be about...sharing. If they could do it, so could we. I'd like to see a followup. I bet Joe and Jill have never ever looked back. And I bet, too, that Becky is a pretty happy kid.
