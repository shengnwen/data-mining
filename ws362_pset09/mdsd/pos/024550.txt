I thought John Steinbeck's The Pearl was a classic mexican folk tale, and truly enjoyed it.  I don't usually read books or novels, but this was good pick. The Pearl is filled with cliff hangers and it will keep readers of all ages wanting more.  Though it was somewhat predictable, it had a message to convey at the end, as all folk tales do.  The book is short and very easy to read, but the author John Steinbeck has written many other novels that I might be interested in reading now.  I give John Steinbeck two thumbs up!!!
