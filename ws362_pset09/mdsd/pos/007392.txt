This book is a collection of photos, facts and figures but despite this it makes a fascinating read.  Mr. Rogers writes about a taboo subject, the mixing of races, or as part of his title states &quot;Research into the  Negro Ancestry in the White Race.&quot;  It is a fascinating book if  somewhat stodgy and a bit pompous in places.  Considering that it was  written at a time when mixing white with black was illegal in many American  States Mr. Rogers does a fairly good job of informing the reader of how the  white-person should not be so complacent about his or her supposedly pure  racial heritage.  Mr. Rogers argues eloquently that race should not be an  issue, and that it is humanity that counts not the colour of a person's  skin.  This is a good book if you want to read various anecdotes about  racial mixing throughout the world both ancient and modern (modern being  the 1950s when this book was published) and I would recommend it as a good  but somewhat dated book on racial issues in the world
