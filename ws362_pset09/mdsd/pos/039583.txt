I really enjoyed this book because it was full of practical parenting tips and Dr. Leman is not shy about what he recommends for healthy family strategies.  The greatest benefit to me was that it caused me to review my own family's priorities and perhaps look at spending more time at home and less time "on the road".  Whatever your religious orientation, this book is a must read; there is something for everyone and a good couples read too. (I could live without the Opie stories--a little boring and dated, I thought.
