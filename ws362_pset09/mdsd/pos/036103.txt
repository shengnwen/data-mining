I'm not under 13, but I lost the password to my account.

It's already been mentioned that the book could have very much been abbreviated, but I find that it's the last 100 pages that are particularly drawn out. But still, for her childhood and teen years, I found the book hard to put down. Also, I'm surprised how much praise the book gets since the writing/grammar is considerably flawed.

Nonetheless, it's a great read. For the first few hundred pages, you'll be gripped. It's a remarkable story
