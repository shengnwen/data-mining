This was the first Christopher Moore book I read and it turned me in to some sort of junky. I mean I went out and bought all his books after reading it, none of them disappoint.

It takes place in San Francisco and it has Emperor Norton in it, you gotta love that, and I really don't want to give the plot away. Read it.
