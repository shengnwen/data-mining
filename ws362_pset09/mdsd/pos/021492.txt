Lorna Doone is a classic tale of romance and bravery, vengance and  villany.  What is important about the book besides the story is the  societal subtext.  When you read this book you get a picture of what made  the British Empire great.  We see Master Jan, or John Ridd, a simple  squire, who catches his own fish, harvests his own wheat at the head of his  labourers.  This humble man is not afraid to take matters all the way up to  his king and expect justice in return. We see a comedy of errors as militia  groups vie with each other and end up fighting each other instead of the  enemy.  The whole tale is told amid the last battles ever fought on English  soil during the little known Monmouth rebellion. A remarkable and  noteworthy book, which tells more than the main story.  It is both a great  read and a portrait of English rural society of the time
