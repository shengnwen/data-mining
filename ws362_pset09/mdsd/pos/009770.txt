*BILLY BUDD, a classic tale by America's Herman Melville, was written 40 years after his burst of creative energy.  Melville still possessed the feeling for a good story, but he wrote it in a language so ornate and (to our modern eyes) stilted, that one can hardly absorb it.  Nevertheless, BILLY BUDD deals with a timeless human issue---the nature of justice.  Billy, a handsome young sailor, has been impressed into the British Navy where he incurs the jealousy or instinctive dislike of an officer.  Billy has done nothing to warrant his wrath and is highly popular among everyone.  This officer, rather more intellectual than most, proves tenaciously vindictive.  He endeavors to trap Billy in a mutinous plot, but Billy rejects the idea.  At last the officer goes to the captain and accuses Billy of mutiny directly.  The captain too likes Billy and cannot believe the accuser.  He calls Billy, who in tense circumstances is apt to stutter or be tongue-tied.  When presented with the officer's accusations, Billy cannot speak.  He strikes the officer.  The conclusion is swift and sad.  I should not reveal the ending, but the question of "what is justice ?" lies at the center of it.  

*Other Tales---these are neither very enjoyable nor easy to read except for BARTLEBY THE SCRIVENER, an amusing story that might remind readers of one episode from "Sinbad the Sailor".   Bartleby, a copyist or scrivener arrives at a lawyer's office and is hired.  He seems to have no past, no present.  We discover that he even lives at the office, never goes out.  He gradually refuses to do all work, but will not leave the premises.  How to get rid of him ?  I could tell you the end, but in the immortal words of Bartleby himself, "I would prefer not to."  This is a minor classic.
