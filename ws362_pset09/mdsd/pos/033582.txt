I like how Caroline Keene writes. She gives great detail. Such as: "She wore a white turban, and the wind whipped her flowing robes about wildly." Also in this story, I could relate to Nancy. Some things she did, the actions she made, I would of done too; for instance, telling the police about the mystery she was trying to solve.
  	This book is about a young boy, named Rishi, who was the maharaja of India. He was kidnapped when an infant. The three people that kidnapped him wanted a different person to rule the land. Nancy's job was to find the culprits and arrest them. But it wasn't easy. Rishi's stepfather was after him, trying to kill him, because he knew too much. He kidnapped Rishi twice, almost killing him. Nancy doesn't know where to look for him. Also someone stole her charm with lifesaving fluids in it, which rishi would need to recover from his injuries. Will Nancy find her charm? Will Rishi ever be found?
    	I think anyone can read this book. Particularly people who like mysteries. And anyone who likes adventure and suspense.
