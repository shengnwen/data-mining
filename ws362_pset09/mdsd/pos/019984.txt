Have a Nice Day! by Mick Foley is the best biography I have ever read.  It is the story about a wrestler from the beginning of his career in the late 1980's through 1999 (when the book was published).  I watched WWF wrestling during the "Attitude Era" (1996-2001) and really thought this book captures not only wrestling, but the man behind most of the most dangerous stunts during this era.

You do not have to be a fan of or even watch wrestling to enjoy this book.  Mick Foley starts the book out when he was about 18 and goes through his teenage years and sports career on Long Island, NY.  From this, he gradually progresses through his college years and his growing interest in wrestling.  He then begins to write about his wrestling career from the start in the late 1980's and includes his family life in the book as well.  Through this book, he gives a great view of all types of wrestling in different locations, from Africa, to Germany, to the South, to the WCW, ECW, and finally his success in the WWF.  

Throughout the book, he manages to keep a comedic tone and make you, the reader, feel as if you are there with him, listening to the other wrestler's stories.  He includes a lot of information on the wrestlers he had roomed with such as Steve Austin, Owen Hart, Vader, and the Undertaker.  However, as it is stated on the insert, this book is not for the squeamish.  He goes into detail on many of his painful injuries and shows that even though thought of as the "fake" sport; wrestling is indeed the most brutal.

The book does end rather abruptly.  It is picking up a lot of momentum toward the last few pages as Mankind wins his first WWF title, but then stops right there.  Don't worry, his second book, Foley is Good picks up right where the action left off in this book.
