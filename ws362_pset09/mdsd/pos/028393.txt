I was intrigued by the title of this book, as I have used Bach lower remedies in the usual way for many years. This book is clearly a labour of love.  It is beautifully written and produced.  It provided a new perspective for me on the remedies. It is accessible to lay people as well as practitioners.  It is one of those books that I would consider buying multiple copies to give to friends
