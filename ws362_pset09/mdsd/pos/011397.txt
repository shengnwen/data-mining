The body of a beautiful woman is found, floating in Boston harbor, with the heart surgically removed. At first glance, it seems that a serial killer, christened Jack, by the press, has struck again, but lawyer Scott Finn and police detective Linda Flaherty are not so sure. What they can be sure of is that someone has gone to a lot of trouble to make it seem to be connected to the previous killings. The murdered woman was an old lover of Scott's which is why he's taking a personal interest, with his involvement increasing until he becomes a suspect in the case with incriminating clues left at his apartment. This is an intriguing story with connections to the underworld, huge business interests and lawyers looking to line their own pockets at everyone else's expense. Rather than the modern take on crime with intricate psychological motives, this has a lot of good old fashioned biffo, as was present in Mickey Spillane books and those of that genre, and I found it to be a very good read
