I'm writing about the 2nd ed. (1990), but if you landed here, I think what I have is of value for later editions too.  The book is fantastic.  There are a myriad of technical terms for various kinds of multivariate analyses.  The average person has no idea what the names mean -- or how to choose between them!  To be able to DO anything (right, anyway) you need a CONCRETE understanding.  Such is what this book provides.  Right off the bat, the book tells you -- not only what kind of data each technique requires -- but what questions you might ask (and want answered) for such data.  So, in a mere 4 pages -- near the beginning! -- you get 1 or 2 paragraphs on each of these:  factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, multiple linear regression, principal components analysis, and more.  You'll know what these techniques require as input (what kinds of data situations) and what they assume the question(s) is/are that you want answered -- already concrete, already good understanding of the differences of the formerly cryptic technique names in a mere 4 pages!  I have seen no other book do this.  The rest of the book is nearly as effective in the decoding of other details of the multivariate analyses.  In short, start with this book, because therein you will be way way ahead in acquiring a perspective on multivariate analyses with little effort.  Go to any other book(s) first and you may eventually develope a perspective -- only by accident, that is with little author help -- after a long hard road.  Get your perspective from the get-go instead -- with this book
