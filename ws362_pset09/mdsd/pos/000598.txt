Something can be nothing, and nothing can be something.  How can we explain about that deep philosophy to children?  The book, Joseph Had a Little Overcoat explains that in a smart and practical way.  It could be nice book to introduce how to recycle old stuff we can't use anymore.  Another noticeable thing with this book is a division between negative (blank) space and positive space (object).  There is no negative space at all.  It includes familiar stuffs we can find around are in this book.  It will be nice book for children to learn them and find them through the book.  Joseph Had a Little Overcoat shows how we can make an idea for children's book from our routine life and also includes the wisdom of our life.  I definitely recommend this book for our precious children
