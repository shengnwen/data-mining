Actually, half-and-half might be a more appropriate analogy for this quartet of love stories.  The first two, by Suzanne Forster and Lori Foster, live up to their billing.  The hilarious affair between secretary Abigail and unaware boss Max builds to a delicious climax featuring a striptease!  And Lori Foster follows by introducing us to the Winston boys, specifically the eldest, Cole, who is seduced by Sophie twice, once as herself and once as her decadent twin sister.  Wonderful characters, delightfully sensual settings - it can't get much better!  And unfortunately, it doesn't.  While the other two tales are sweet romances, they don't compare well with the crisp sparkle of the first two stories.  The plots are bland, and the characters are almost too good to be true.  It was worth buying this book for the first two tales, but the second two are a disappointment
