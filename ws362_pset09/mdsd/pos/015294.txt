Half of Volume 2 consists of further classical guitar instruction, while the second half is a repertoire. This repertoire alone is worth the price of the book. The pieces are divided into the periods of the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, and Modern (though the Modern period pieces are few because of copyright restrictions). Many of these transcriptions are the ones CP has himself used in performance. All include tips on how to play them. Note that there is no tablature in this book.
