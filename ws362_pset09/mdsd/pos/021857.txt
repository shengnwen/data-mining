Washington Square is a pleasure to read.  Best of all is Henry James' lush prose; his ethereal descriptions of characters and their emotional states and feelings towards others is peerless - and beautiful, and often funny in a stylistic sense.  The novel itself functions as an expostition of human greed and the need for control, physically and emotionally.  The four focal characters are all well drawn, and because of that their more despicable natures come forward.  The naive Catherine; her father, the overbearing Dr. Sloper; his sister, the officious Mrs. Penniman; and the greedy, and lazy, Morris Townsend, ostensibly interested in Catherine only for her, and her father's, money.  There is plenty of scheming and posturing by all four of them, and any more words from me will spoil the novel.  Also amusing, is the dated sensibilities of the characters; but it all adds up to an enjoyable novel by an American master
