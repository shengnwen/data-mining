Disease-Proof Your Child does two things no other book has ever done. First, it clearly and persuasively presents scientific research that shows what our children eat now will more or less determine their risk of developing cancer and other killer diseases as adults. After reading the first few pages, you will never again view sodas, donuts, fries, pizzas, candies and other "All-American" junk foods as innocent again. 

Allowing and encouraging our kids to eat this garbage on a regular basis is excusable only when we don't know what we're doing. Now that Dr. Fuhrman has exposed the truth - we can cause or prevent 99% of all diseases by what we eat - no parent who reads this book will be able to allow their child to develop "cancer on the installment plan" through malnutrition. And if you're not into long-term thinking, Dr. Fuhrman also demonstrates the link between the Standard American Diet and the national epidemics of childhood asthma, ear infections, colds, flus, and allergies.

So a warning: do not buy this book unless you're willing to exert your responsibility to protect your children. If you read it and do nothing, you'll go through hell as you watch your kids poisoning themselves with their favorite addictive substances and starving their immune systems by not eating nutrient rich foods.

Which brings me to the second thing this book does that no other has: it provides tools and a roadmap and a philosophy for transitioning your family to a healthy diet. Remember paint by numbers? This is the diet transition equivalent. From practical ideas (the "refigerator advertisements" is a wonderful example) to over 50 recipes ("string beans and almost dust" will blow you away with its simplicity and how much your kids will love it) to lists of delicious "non-recipe snacks" that ensure you'll always have healthy alternatives to junk fod - Disease-Proof Your Child is a well-written and well thought out "operations manual" to your most important job as a parent: setting your child up for a lifetime of health and happiness.

In Disease-Proof Your Child, Dr. Fuhrman explains:

- how to prepare your home for eating healthfully before making the shift
- why "three meals a day" is a recipe for failure when it comes to feeding kids right
- why focusing on quality, not quantity, is the key to healthy eating
- why "consistent but not perfect" is more effective than 100% "compliance"
- when and where it's OK to compromise
- how to teach your kids never to "diet"
- how to reform the picky eater

Dr. Fuhrman is not an armchair researcher. He runs a family practice, and offers many case studies that show exactly how families transitioned successfully to a healthy diet - even when both parents thought their child's eating habits were a lost cause.

After reading the first half of the book, you will be shocked, angry, and motivated like crazy to do something to save your kids from a lifetime of obesity and disease. The second half of the book, the solution, is going to get dog-eared and underlined and photocopied and food-spattered. You're going to want to recommend it to your friends, mostly because you won't be able to part with your own copy. I already find I need two - one for my study and another for the cookbook shelf.

There are few books ever written that have to potential to have such a huge positive impact on the well-being of your family. Is it easy to put this into practice? Not at first. But is it worth it? Try the following thought experiment:

It's 35 years from now. Your child is a grownup, with a kid in elementary school and another in high school. You get to choose one of the following scenarios: a) your child is a healthy and vibrant adult, at the prime of life; or b) your child has just been diagnosed with cancer, possibly fatal within 3 years.

I know that's stark. But the links between what we feed our kids now and their health as adults are that real. Try the thought experiment for 2 minutes and see what moves within you.

If you're not able to link current behavior with the long-term future, here's another experiment:

What if you were able to prevent most of the ear infections, allergies, colds, feveres, and severe asthma attacks that your child gets on a regular basis? The long nights up with a crying child, the endless trips to the doctor for another round of antibiotics, the missed events, the feelings of "when will they outgrow it"? That's a real outcome too.

Please - as a health educator, as a parent, as someone who cares about the world we're sending our kids into - I urge you to get and study this book.
