I find it curious that some readers found this book wanting. I would admit it had its slow times, but over all I was very impressed.

Besides a reasonable story line of the fictional voyage, the author had lots of the sea history of steam vs. sail, rounding the "Horn", navigating, scurvy, etc. I liked it all and appreciated the author's connection with long-lost relatives.

My recommendation: if you like "fictional history" from that era this is a good choice
