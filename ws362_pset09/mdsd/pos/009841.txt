The detailed instructions on each exercise are extremely helpful for those of us who are "word" people, but it is probably most useful as an accompaniment to a video or to working with a certified instructor in a studio.  I am doing both of those and found this helpful, but if one were clueless you might not "get it" just from the book.  

By the way, one reviewer asked why the exercises aren't listed separately by level of skill required.  The answer is that in the Pilates method the sequence of exercises is considered extremely important AND when you are more advanced you continue to do the more basic exercises (sometimes with more difficult positioning of legs, arms or body.)
