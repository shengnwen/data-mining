I couldn't put this book down!!  I drove my husband nuts by putting all the stickers on everything standing still.  I carried the flashcards everywhere.  I equate it to a first semester college language class.  Don't expect miracles, just enjoy learning the language.  My only gripe about this book is that you don't hear the language being spoken.  I watched our DVDs in French to get used to the speed of the native speakers
