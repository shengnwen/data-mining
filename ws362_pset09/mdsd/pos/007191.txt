If Chandra's book ever goes into a second edition, he and his editor should change the title to "Bombay" or "Mumbai".  What are "sacred games" anyway?  Perhaps Hindis know, but for this American reader, a slight allusion to life being a game does not amount to a clear and distinctive religious view of life and the universe.

But no matter. This sprawling portrait of modern, corrupt and loveable Mumbai is like a film noir story inflated by a passion for movies.  Indians seem obsessed by films, and Chandra uses his own passion to create a novel that is grandly suspenseful as well as spectacular in ambiance.  I felt as if he had watched and rechanneled his enjoyment of every crime series he's ever watched on TV or on the silver screen, especially "24" and "The Godfather".

Whatever its sources, "Sacred Games" is a great read
