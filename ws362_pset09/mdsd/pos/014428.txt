The first part of the book is amazing, the part where it explains how nlp started and gives a few examples of how the brain works. But it becomes too goal oriented, like what do you want to do with your life? This part bothered me because I didn't want to find my meaning on earth, I just wanted to develop tools for my every day life.

It's just the way the subjects were brought that bugged me but there are good topics covered in that book and I recommend it.
