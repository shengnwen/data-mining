As a physician working with hundreds of &quot;tired&quot; women, I found this book intriguing to say the least so I put Gittleman's theory to the test.  Out of the 50 women I have tested for serum copper and zinc levels nearly 75% of them have demonstrated a zinc defienciency and copper  dominance.  I am treating these women with Gittleman's protocol and diet  plan. Nearly 50% have already noticed a more even energy level - it has  been 6 weeks since they have been on the plan - and all say they feel  better overall.  Ann Louise Gittleman has always been a pioneer and ahead  of the crowd by at least five years.  I am glad that my patients can take  advantage of her insights now. A brave book and I feel so sad that so many  readers have truly missed the boat on this one
