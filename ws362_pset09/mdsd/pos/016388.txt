This is a very good book for a beginner who wants to learn the basic concepts of effective unarmed combat. These basic concepts are taught to special forces of many of the world's militant forces, so it is an excellent starter book for someone wanting to train in REAL and EFFECTIVE self defense. By reading this book, a begginer will efficently expose him/herself to defense tactics which can be used in real life self defense, and it may also help  the reader select a martial art that can be applied to real life.   I'm not trying to say that many of the martial arts out there are ineffective in real life situations, but the concepts covered in this book are used by militant forces that must use these techniques in order to survive, so they MUST be effective. 

This book, however, will be relatively useless to an expirienced or advanced fighter/ martial artist.
