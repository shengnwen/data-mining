I picked up a bargain copy of this book from my local bookstore ... and fell in love with the Scarlet Pimpernel! I couldn't put it down. Sadly, the book ended too soon for my liking!   

I've since read most of the rest of the series, and have re-purchased the original book, and as many of the others, in library binding. They are a permanent addition to my home library. 

Note to a previous reviewer: Never read the introductions before the story! Inevitably there will always be spoilers. But the secret identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel is soon enough discovered in the 1st book anyway. The books may be enjoyed more for the simplicity and intrigue of adventure, than for a Zorro-like mystery of discovering the hero's identity.
