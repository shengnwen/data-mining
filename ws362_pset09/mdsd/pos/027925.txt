The CD was great to listen to as the author's accent set the mood up nicely. I looked all over the box before I checked it out of the library but didn't notice it was abridged. I definately prefer the unabridged, but I suppose that would have been too much. There were 9 CD's in the set as it was.

It seemed to include much more of the early years, and seemed to thin out quite a bit towards the final days.

If the CD's were unabridged I could easlily recommend them, but as it now looks as if they were abridged, I'd say probably better to read the book and get all the details. Too bad.

But, if you don't particularly feel like reading through a large book like this one, the CD audio is definatley worth listening to. It was all very good. Nice accent too
