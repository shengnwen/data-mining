This second book in the DREAD EMPIRE'S FALL series is even better than the first. The characters continue to develop in complexity and their lives become even more complicated. An empire-wide civil war just makes matters worse for those involved. The result is a good story and bad times for galactic civilization.

In this installment the two major protagonists are reunited for a brief time only to have their personal foibles drive them apart. Each goes his/her own way and puts all available energies into fighting the war. Martinez does so with the fleet in space and Sula does so as a ground pounder. Each is extremely competent and each faces unexpected troubles. 

I'm ready now for the next book.
