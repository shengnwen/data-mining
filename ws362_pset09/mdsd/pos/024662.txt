Having been raised by two Caribbean parents in the Caribbean I could definitely relate to life in the Bahamas. I can't tell you how many times we've seen his movies. And surprisingly to this day I can recite the lines word for word. He speaks very eloquently and although he does go on and on about little things you have to digest every word. He goes into great detail about his struggles and achievements in life and acting.
  Overall it's definitely a good read for an aspiring actor/actress.
