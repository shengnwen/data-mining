One of my faves. Friedman was one of the best. Also read THE ROAD TO SERFDOM by F. A. Hayek. 

As for Reviewer T.A. Turner: the good news is that your lobotomy IS reversible. There are a lot of brilliant ex-Marxists about these days. Reading Thomas Sowell for starters just may restore your mind. Of course, if it's your heart that's the problem....

Putting forth a man like V.I. Lenin who said: 

"It would not matter if 3/4 of the human race perished; the important thing is that the remaining 1/4 be communist" 

---as an paragon of "compassion" is truly pathetic! 

Yeah, the "compassionate" followers of Marx, Trotsky, Lenin, Mao & Pol Pot have thus far "liberated" by mass murder between 95 and 150 million souls. Purges, Pogroms and Killing Fields!  No other political party in human history has shed so much blood in the space of a single century. And Mr. Turner's colon is is knots over a Goldwater cartoon! Give me a break
