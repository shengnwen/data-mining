Beyond telling you what position lobsters really have sex in, this book is funny and informative about the little known lives of lobsters.  The story reads quickly at first and then dives you into the details of lobster life, from there it drives back out into a subtle and slow end.  A great summer read, especially when near the coast of Maine
