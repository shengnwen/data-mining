This is an ecellent book! I have read ,many, many dog training books, -but found in this book, all the anwers to my dog training and dog behaviour questions.

I loved the training methods ,which are explained in great detail and the many anecdotes. This book is definitely going to be my new "dog bible" when I soon obtain another "bundle of joy!".
