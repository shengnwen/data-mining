"The Rapture" is a welcomed, valuable reference edition for anyone examining eschatology. 

Dr. Tim LaHaye, of 'Left Behind' notoriety, divides his volume of study into three primary sections. He begins by exposing and then deftly answering the basic challenges to the reality of the Rapture in seven defining chapters approaching the event from as many aspects. 

Next, the author turns his focus to the timing presented through the pre-tribulation view, including chapters reviewing the other most popular positions of consideration and then closing that section with a final admonition in support of the Pre-Trib stand.

The final passage, consisting of six portions, examines the primary attacks on the Pre-Trib position opening with a detailed analysis of John Darby's life and influence on the teaching. Dr. LaHaye helpfully includes documentation by other scholars that have been chronicling Darby's involvement in the Rapture debate over the past century and more. 

Dr. LaHaye's work is a needful response to the continuing attacks on a position that holds more credibility within Scripture than any other offering for endtime fulfillment.

It is positively exciting to be living in the days in which so many prophecies are either being realized or coming to light. And so deep appreciation is rightfully bestowed upon author LaHaye for not only his scholarship, but also his well-advised warning. Dr. LaHaye summons especially all who subscribe to the pre-tribulation pre-millennial view that caution is paramount for all delving into the study of these things which must soon so surely come to pass.
