This is a great book for fans of the Fighting Irish. It delves into and gives great accounts of 20 of the biggest games in Notre Dame history.

From the "Gipper" game to Notre Dame's huge victory over Miami on the road to their National Championship in 1988 to the "Game of the Century" in 1993, this covers most of the biggest moments in Notre Dame history.

The DVD is nice for showing highlights of a lot of these games. (Though I wonder why some of the footage from later years looks like practice film instead of TV broadcast tape.)

The book is the best part. It doesn't just give a play-by-play of each game, but talks about the interesting stories leading up to and after the games.

Seminole fans, stay home.
