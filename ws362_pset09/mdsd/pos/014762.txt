I picked up this book after seeing Lieberman's show on Food Network.  The recipes and advice in this short but informative cookbook are simple and easy to make, regardless of the reader-cook's skill level.

What was perhaps the best section of the book for me was the beginning portions that discussed the different terms, tools, ingredients and other ground rules for cooking that often go over-looked in more sophisticated cookbooks.  

I would recommend this book for a person who doesn't necessarily want to jump headfirst into a cooking adventure (that often requires an investment in cookware, ingredients, etc.), who mainly is looking for fun and easy home cooking.  Perfect for a college student or young professional, this book speaks in a common vernacular that will ensure the cook knows s/he is following the instructions correctly. 

(For instance, nothing is more frustrating for me than a cookbook/recipe that uses industry or learned-cook terms and does not explain what I should be doing in language a layperson could understand.  Instead of saying something like "whip until stiff peaks form" or "mince cloved garlic" and leaving it at that, Lieberman would say "whip until stiff peaks form, which means..." - definitely a good thing for the unsure/novice chef.)

Written as if he's speaking the words on his TV show, this book is easy to understand, contains recipes that are both delicious and easy to complete, and is unpretentious about an activity that can be daunting for those unfamiliar with the terrain.  Great for gift-giving or personal shelves alike
