Yes, that is the sad truth of casebooks, regardless of what I put here you will be paying too much for it.  What would Posner say about that choice?

Well, I agree with other reviewers that this is a very well written  casebook, the editors do a good job of tying their little infuriating hypotheticals and questions into the text. 

On the other hand, Aspen casebooks are horrible.  You are going to have red and black paint all over anything that touches these crappy books and they are going to fall apart the second time you open them.  

However, this property book is exciting because it is so small.  It is much smaller than your average casebook and fits snugly in your hand.  Why?  I have no idea.  But it is comforting.
