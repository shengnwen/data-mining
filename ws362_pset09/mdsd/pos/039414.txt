  I can be a harsh critic of books if they deserve it.  I have given a few negative reviews at times and some mediocre ones.  But this book does not deserve the criticism it has received!  It's also notable that while there are many negatives there's also many people who have given it five stars.  
  I won't bore you with the plot.  But this book is well written and, I think, better in some ways than the previous novels of this series.  There is almost no kinky scenes and the plot and characterization was very well done.  Many readers complained of repetition-there wasn't that much.  Although her previous efforts were good this one is particuarly well written.  Give it a chance.  The only complaint I can register is that as part of a vampire series it doesn't really include them.  And yet it was unexpected and refreshing.
