This book, on the history of the concept of "civilization" (not the history of civilizations as such), is a delightfully conversational read.  Mazlish writes with simplicity and good sense as he traces how what we understand today to mean by civilization in fact derives from eighteenth-century European discourses about the structure of social systems in a globalized world.

With regard to his topic, Mazlish aims to be neither comprehensive nor didactic but simply informative, recognizing the need to clarify the history behind recent usages of civilization in heated political and cultural debates.  While his readings of the likes of John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, and Sigmund Freud are not exactly "new," together they give the average reader a fine sense of how "civilization is a trope filled with ambiguities, many of them of a political nature" (147).  Civilization, in other words, is not an "innocent" concept.  But Mazlish intuits that if we are to contest the dubious claims made by some about our current geopolitical climate, we need to understand why the so-called "clash of civilizations" is too obtuse and historically inaccurate a formulation to realize a more responsible "dialogue of civilizations" or (given the realities of economic and cultural globalization) a "global civilization."

My sole reservation about this book is its rather perfunctory treatment of gender issues.  Mazlish acknowledges that "women have been seen widely...as the measure of civilization" but doesn't go on to ask why, and to what ends, this might be so (158).  If civilization is at times most profoundly construed as a question of "women's worth" in society, then it seems Mazlish should devote more time to the issue as it amplifies across the texts he's chosen to analyze
