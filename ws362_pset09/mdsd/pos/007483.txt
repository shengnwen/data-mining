In this novel Hiaasen, apart from his almost-usual cast of characters and target of his vitriol, throws some rocks at politically correct and fashionable psychotherapy; which appears like something not all that far removed from the methods used in Clockwork Orange. 

Twilly, the guy with the 'anger' issues and Desie, wife of a typical self-centered Hiaasen idiot/criminal, bond over the Labrador retriever, Boodle----and in the process the reader must figure out just exactly where he or she stands on the limits of what is permissible to defend 'the environment'. Hiaasen's personal rage and frustration, usually instantiated in the character 'Skink', here finds a somewhat less deranged expression in Twilly. But there's a lot of anger lurking underneath the comedy, black and grey, as well as the romance.

It's not as 'light' a work as 'Skinny Dip', but I liked it very much.
