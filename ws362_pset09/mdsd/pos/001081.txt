A very good and MUCH NEEDED book. It really does what it says on the tin. It changes you for the better. Not by casting outside ideas or rituals inside of you, but by awakening YOUR OWN primordial self goodness, or buddhahood, which really has been, and is with you at all times.

Some people (westerners) may find concern or trouble that this book is in a Buddhist or Tibetan context. NO WORRIES. The book and author are not there to 'recruit' anyone onto nothing. It is a revealing book about primordial human commom attitudes, feelings, hopes and fears, and the very much common human death that ALL follow. A WIN WIN situation if you read it and give it a deep thought or a chance to what you just read. Specially when you have the feeling that there must be something more to life than what is perceived in our pragmatic and materialistic west. Best of luc
