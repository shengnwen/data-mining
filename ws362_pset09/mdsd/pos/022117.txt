I borrowed the unabridged audio version of Porterhouse Blue from the local library, and listened while riding my bike.  I'm afraid I made a spectacle of myself as I rode along, cracking up , with tears of laughter streaming  down my face!  I'm sure it was the funniest book I've ever read.  I'm here  at amazon.com looking for more of Mr. Sharpe
