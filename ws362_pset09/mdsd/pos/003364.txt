The comparison of a modem sending tens of thousand of bits a second with the focused effort of a practiced telegrapher sold me on this book.  We all know what happened to the telegrapher; the implicit question being asked is what of our modern professions is destined for the same fate?

This book highlights the various analogies between Victorian technology and the technology of the present.  While they appear so obvious upon reading, the honest reader will admit that Mr. Standage has unearthed many lessons lost over the years--not the least of which is the value of thinking big--thinking well beyond the capability of current technology.  Overall this book is an excellent primer in the oft-forgotten fact that history repeats itself and that the educated among us should seek a better understanding of the past before making decisions about our future.

Mr. Standage's admiration for the feats of those who dared to think big enough to complete a transatlantic cable comes through strongly.  He strikes a wistful tone--like many others, he demonstrates that our present-day technology can achieve far more than we sometimes dare to think.
