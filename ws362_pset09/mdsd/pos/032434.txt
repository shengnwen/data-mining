Read this novel for the exquisitely crafted prose.  The sentences are understated, spare, austere, yet luscious.  Unfortunately, the story itself is skeletal and the main characters with the exception of Aldred Leith thinly sketched.  Also, all the characters think and speak in the same spare, luscious voice - which is perhaps believable for a war veteran of 33, but hardly for a 17 year old girl and her teenage brother.  No matter how precocious they may be, teenagers don't have enough life experience to utter the wise sayings these munchkins do.

I would've liked to see more historical context - though the war looms huge, we see only its aftereffects on the emotions and psyches of the characters.  Not much about the devastation of Hiroshima is delved into, although this is Leith's purpose for being in Japan.  I guess the book is what it is.  Maybe Hazzard excludes historical context from her repertoire.

It's a bummer how women are treated here; with one exception, they either endure lives of loneliness and quiet desperation, or are lovely exotic flowers destined to shrivel and die in their arid surroundings, or have learned from experience or the lack of desirable men to suppress their longings and hopes for the future.
