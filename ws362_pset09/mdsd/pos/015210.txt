I haven't seen writing this carefully crafted in a long time. Gave me goose bumps!  Liar's Club is the kind of book that inspires other people to write. And it's a memoir! You will find some really poignant, often terrifying observations from the view of a child. Karr is not afraid to show the spontaneity that leads a child to do gauky and often hateful things. I had forgotten some of the irrational behavior I engaged in as a kid, and this book brought it back and nearly puts it under a microscope. The pace of this memoir quickens after the first third of the book, but it takes that long to develop these very three dimensional characters. (I keep forgetting these "characters" are/were real people!) Mary Karr deserves a standing ovation. Read this book. It's a true pleasure, and you will be better for having read it.
