This is another of them -- they keep you reading (I read this one in a couple of days) and you enjoy them while you're reading them.  And yet...

They are not all that memorable and sometimes I find her "detective" characters (Brady and Beaumont) indefinably irritating -- they're just too good to be true, just too competent, and not vulnerable enough. Quite frankly, them and their near-perfect lives are intimidating. I'll bet Joanna Brady's house is never a mess -- she's got the perfect husband staying home taking care of everything for her.  I guess that's every working woman's dream...

Aside from that...this is a well-constructed and well-written mystery.  Although one reviewer said he/she knew all along who did it, I didn't, although in retrospect it all made sense, which makes for a good mystery in my opinion.  The plot involves a woman murdered in her trailer -- for some reason she has 17 dogs in the trailer with her and they die of the heat before her body is discovered.  With all those dogs, there's a subplot about animal welfare issues (although personally I think the word "hoarder" gets thrown around too much and the issue ought to be not the number of animals but whether they're adequately cared for).  Another subplot involves polygamous communities in the Arizona area (where the Joanna Brady series is set).  Then there are two other bodies that may connect to the woman in the trailer, and a coyote driving an SUV full of undocumented aliens trying to slip across the border -- all in all, there are a lot of subplots being juggled in this story, and the plot moves back and forth among all of these subplots.

All in all, Jance is an excellent craftsman, and I like the Joanna Brady series, but there are days when I wish that Sheriff Brady was less intimidating.  I can recommend this book as being at least equal to others in the series (and maybe better) for those already familiar with the Joanna Brady series.
