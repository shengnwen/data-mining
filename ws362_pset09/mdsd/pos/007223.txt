These photographs were originally published in 1967 and at the time, they represented the norm for solid earnest photography.  that is, the technique and understated design stood in service of the images.  By the way, I've seen the actual photographs.  The Museum of the City of New York just opened a show of these same images.  So one reacts not to the photo but to the subject: these now long gone buildings, and the even older signs of a long past life (for example a calendar from 1951 on the wall of one of the shabby lofts).

This work stands in sharp contrast to the current trend in photography ....  a typical current show will feature large scale images, usually in color, always over printed.  I will be standing in front of a life sized and unflattering portrait of a person - and wonder why the image was selected.  After noting the skin texture (always more present than in life) I walk away with...  nothing.  Not so with these.  I first saw this book in 1970 when in a sculpture class in Cooper Union.  Although I had not seen the book in at least 25 years, I never forgot them.

Buy the book - it will be one book you will look at for sure 25 years hence
