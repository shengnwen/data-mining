I was not sure what to expect when I picked up the book, but for [the price] why not check it out.  It was much better than anything I expected or have read in similar titles.  The author gives the reader a solid foundation for entering and exiting low priced stocks.  The book is filled with lots of good examples of the right time to buy beaten up stocks.  The primary focus of his selection technique is technical analysis, although there is a fundamental bent thrown in.  If you are thinking that there are bargins to be had after the past 2 years in the market, this is a title well worth checking out
