Just finished reading this book, finally! As usual, i will give a good/bad breakdown of this novel.

Good: First off, Brown gets the gold star for research. Although im not much of an expert on glaciology or the inner workings of NASA, I will say this boy did his homework. All the info was well researched, well written, and I was surprised all the way until the end. I also liked how the two story lines intertwined.

Bad: Was a bit long and seemed to drag out in some points. Some of the info was technical jargon. It did help the reader understand, but it also made it a little boring. 

In all, it was an interesting story, but not as good as Digital Fortress. But it was very well written. Great job
