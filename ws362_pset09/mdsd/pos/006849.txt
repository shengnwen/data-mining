ICEBOUND is a little different story-line than Koontz' normal style and makes for a very interesting book. This is about a group of scientists in the Arctic working together to help the earth with their water shortage problem. This group must place bombs below the ice surface to get a large piece of ice dislocated from the mass, so it can be floated down to warmer climates, and be used for drinking water. Sounds simple, right ... wrong. Murphy's Law comes into effect. A member of the group turns out to be a psychopathic killer, an earthquake hits and makes returning to their home camp impossible, and after sixty bombs are placed and the timers set, a series of storms hit which make rescue seem impossible. Not only do they have to get off the ice cap, but also they have to figure out which one of them is the killer.

ICEBOUND is a very suspenseful novel and an interesting diversion from the normal Koontz writing style. I found it very enjoyable, and a book even younger readers (pre-teens) can enjoy.
