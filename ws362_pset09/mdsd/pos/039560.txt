This is a book written to Christians, that is, to people who have received Jesus Christ as personal Savior. The principles laid out are for Godly living, personal accountabilty, truth with one's self, and ultimately for the glorification of God and the Lord Jesus Christ by the individual believer. Tozer is very frank in his acessment of the way Christians display ungodly as well as godly attributes and behavior.  If your goal is to emulate what God has revealed in the Bible as a profitable Christian life you will enjoy the 52 chapters compiled by Wiersbe. Tozer as usual will motivate introspection through the guidance of the Word of God and the Holy Sririt of God. I highly recommend this book, as well as any Tozer material available
