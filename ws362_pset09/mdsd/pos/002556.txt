I found this book to be a good read, and generally helpful.
HOWEVER, his fairly liberal use of soy milk is definetly not helpful to my family. My daughter is allergic, and even if she was not I don't feel comfortable giving a [...] much soy at all. He discourages the use of rice milk, so i'm assuming he'd advocate for the replacement of almond milk?
Regardless, soy is difficult for many people to digest, and us a common allergin, and so i'm perplexed by his dependency on it when it comes to his recipes
