This was even more resourceful than Attitude 101 which I thoroughly enjoyed. I like the references to the past & present leaders, the real subtleties that he makes mention of, and also the quotes he uses. The book has real substance, it's a good read, and well worth the time. Highly recommend it, whether you are a leader, or just an aspiring one
