A strangly fascinating book...didn't expect it to be so engrossing. Lived in Chicago for a time, and find I knew little about the history.
The parallel plot was a stroke of genius...the bright lights...the century
of progress, and the horror that was patiently waiting in the shadows!!
JUST TERRIFIC!!
