Besides leaving behind a freeway named after him, Reuther is a modern Father of the Radical Left, and has left behind a legacy of Union corruption, crooked party politics, and collective brainwashing.  A fascinating book, a fascinating man, and a heck of a story, it's ideologically incorrect in that it exalts Reuther toward legacy status, and it appeases those that believe in the power of government, and the collective mentality of the masses.  It's all good and well, says the author, because unions and government usurpation and regulation are all glorious.  Horrible mentality, but good writing and research.  Reach your own judgements
