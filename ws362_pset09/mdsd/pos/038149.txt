Billy Crystal is a charming, funny, vibrant performer, and his personality shines through in this delightful book!  Based on his successful stage show, Crystal invites you into his life and through his mastery of words, reminds us that all of us are basically the same deep down. His tales of growing up in a household filled with music, love, and crazy relatives are injected with his humor.  It is amazing that he met and knew so many performers through his talented family; it's no wonder the man went into show business. When Crystal shares his experiences with his father, he does so with care, giving us not only the best but also the most identifiable. At times I laughed out loud and at times the memories were so poignant that I felt near tears. I could "hear" Crystal's voice through his words, and though he is Jewish and I am not, I felt a deep kinship with him as I read the account of his growing up. This book is highly recommended to all, and especially those of us who adore Billy Crystal.  Truly a magical work
