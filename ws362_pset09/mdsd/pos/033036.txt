Here's another great installment in the Anna Pigeon, National Park Service Ranger, series, set in the Natchez Trace Parkway National Park.  A local good ol' boy is found murdered on NPS land, and the usual suspects are brought in for questioning.  Doyce Barnette, the victim, hasn't engendered much emotion in anyone he knew in life, so Anna is unable to easily find a motive.  Doyce's brother, the local undertaker and Sheriff wannabee, is a good bet because he stands to inherit and is a slimy character as well, but that may be too easy an answer.  Added to this mystery is the bigger question of who wants Anna dead, as she survives a couple of near-death accidents.  Her colleagues in the NPS office are suspect, as one is a friend and one is a proven foe.  Watching Anna deal with her managerial tasks is a hoot as she is not a paper-pusher but a do-er.  Also, watching the developing romance between Anna and sheriff Paul Davidson brings to light another side of Anna previously neglected, and shows that Barr can write strong personal fiction in addition to straight suspense.
