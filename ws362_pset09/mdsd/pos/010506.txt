I have owned Donald J. Borror's DICTIONARY OF WORD ROOTS AND COMBINING FORMS for at least 20 years and would never dream of parting with it. Though I consult it only rarely, it can be immensely helpful when one wishes to delve into the meaning of obscure words, particularly of the scientific or bio-medical sort.

This dictionary is comprised mainly of an alphabetical listing of Greek and Latin roots, though commonly used roots and combining forms from other languages are included as well. There are also useful chapters on the formulation of scientific names, the transliteration of Greek words, and on common combining forms. This last chapter (the one on common combining forms) is particularly useful if your goal is to create new descriptive words as it is conveniently subdivided into descriptive categories (color, size, shape, animal structures, etc.).

I would have to admit that the DICTIONARY OF WORD ROOTS AND COMBINING FORMS would not be near the top of any list of writer's "essential" references, but I do not mean to imply by this that it is not worth owning. On the contrary, I believe that this happy little dictionary is highly useful-though specialized-and should be included in any complete writer's library.
