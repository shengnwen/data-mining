I've been furiously purchasing chocolate books to learn as much as possible about the food of the gods and Pierre Herme's book is the most spectacular, creative and amazing.

Everything is in metric weight...which is great.   Compared to Robert Linxe's book for La Maison du Chocolat, I gotta say Pierre's shines.  Whilst La Maison was good...with nice pix, the recipes were horribly noted and one feels like Linxe is hiding the real recipe.   

Pierre's book gave inspiration, lots of ideas, and most importantly, lots of great recipes I can use.

Amazing amazing amazing.  Can't wait to try his creations at his stores in Tokyo
