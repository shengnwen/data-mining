This book was very instrumental in helping me to educate and teach others about a topic that is hard to approach in today's society. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested inchanging the current status of society by encouraging others to critical evaluate their own actions, thoughts and behaviors.

If you haven't picked up this book, you need to. An excellent resource to begin your journey towards an oppression free society and an educated society. I highly recommend this book for anyone currently teaching in any type of classroom
