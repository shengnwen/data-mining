This book wasn't what I thought it would be. From the reviews I thought it was going to be a very good book. I'm giving it four stars though, because I started reading this book about 10 hours and finished it because I just couldn't sit it down. 

The ending of the book made me smile because she got the little party she dreamed of even if the cake wasn't present. 

I'm looking forward to reading "The Best Little Girl in the World" now. I will start it tonight.
