You've got to have a Netter's Atlas on hand.  You never know when you'll need it.  Even if you are well out of medical school, well cocooned in your tight little sub-specialty, you still need Netter.  You never know when your elderly neighbor is going to knock on your door and ask you precisely which muscle in her back hurts when she stands up, just to pick a random example.  

But especially for learning the anatomy in the first place, both the structure and function, there is nothing that compares.  The level of detail is astounding, the care and thought put into every illustration is staggering. 

And you really should have the newest edition, edited in part by the great Dr. Hanson from the University of Rochester, with over 10,000 anatomical terms, and many illustrations now correlated with MRI images.  You know what I did?  I gave my old Netter's to my nephew and bought the new one.  He's into science, has kid's books on anatomy.  Why don't you do that?  Give your old Netter's, cadaveric juice stains and all, to a young eager kid, be a little ceremonial about it, then get on Amazon and buy the newest edition.  Then email me and say, "thanks, you were right about that."
