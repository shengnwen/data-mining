In a goal-driven society, it was very hard for me to believe that someone had "invented" a concept of "Goal-Free Living."  But Stephen Shapiro has done just that!  With innovative thinking and progressive concepts, he has transformed me from a guilt-ridden person to a (almost!) guilt-free person, allowing me to "write the script" of my life as each day presents itself. It is important to keep in mind that living goal-free does not mean you can't plan a trip or achieve a desired level of employment due to well thought out steps of progress.  On the contrary, I find this book frees up my time to "plan" the things that are really important to me and leave behind the things that aren't.  Whether you are a career minded person or someone in a unique position such as myself (care-giver to my sister who has terminal cancer), you will find tidbits of usable knowledge on each and every page.  This book will always be on my end table or my nightstand.  I guarantee you will not regret investing in this book.  Good luck!!
