Jim is just a boy, that works at the Admiral Benbox Inn, but he can see that Billy Bones is a nervous man, always alert and watching for stangers arriving at the inn.  And he has the right to be nervous, because he possesses a map drawn by Capitan Flint, the most feared pirate to ever roam the high seas.

Well, Flint died, but there's plenty of men who served with Capitan Flint still alive who feel they deserve a fair share of the treasure.  The map, though, ends up with Jim Hawkins - (it's a near thing, read the book to find out how that happens).  Jim confides in the local doctor and squire, who work together to acquire a ship, a crew, and provisions to sail for Treasure Island.  There is a weak link though, because although Squire Trelawney is well-intentioned, he has a big mouth.  By the time the Hispaniola is ready for sea, she is boarded by the old murderous mob who sailed with Flint!

There's a scene in the book where Jim, hiding in a barrel on deck, discovers that mutiny is planned.  The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to take over the ship and make this journey their own, taking all the treasure for themselves.  There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim, aboard the ship.

And now....You will have to read the book for yourself to see what happens next.  This is a fantastic story of double-crossing and deceit, bravery and cowardice.  I don't know how things would have turned out if Jim hadn't been involved.  For it is he who finds Ben Gunn, marooned on the island, half-mad with isolation.  And it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place.

And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all? No?  Well, don't expect me to tell you, you will have to read this amazing pirate tale for yourself.
