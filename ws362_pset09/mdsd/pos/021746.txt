This is a good history book on how things were before, DV video is the more modern way to go, it is cheaper (Less then $3.00 per hour to film versus over $450 per hour with 16 mm film) DV video lasts 60 minutes before you have to change it out of the camera and 16mm lasts only 11 minutes before you have to change it. A 16mm camera costs over $25,000 while a decent Prosumer DV Camera costs $3,500. You can edit DV Video on your high powered PC much easier then on film, plus you need special equipment to edit 16mm film. If you would like to get a history lesson on how film is made this is the book for you, otherwise buy the book "Digital Filmmaking 101" and learn the more modern and affordable way to get into being a producer
