This is definately one of the most powerful books I've ever read. True story of a woman who developed 92 distinct personalities as a result of the horrific incest and physical torture she suffered throughout her childhood since the age of 2. Written by the woman herself in the voices of her various "troops".  As, with the help of her therapist, she slowly uncovers the nightmare of her childhood. A very harrowing book, not for the timid, but also inspiring because of the woman's incredible courage and the fascinating coping mechanism she developed to cope with unimaginable horror
