This is the catalogue for an exhibition held at the Brooklyn museum which benefited from many loans from private collections. The artist's brief career is shown here with many of his best paintings from the pivotal 1982 year. The quality of the images is excellent. Now this book has not lifted my doubts whether Basquiat is really a great artist in the line of Twombly and Dubuffet whose influences he acknowledged. Seeing his oeuvre in a retrospective as complete as this one, I can't help but noticing a weakening in the "late years", that is after 1984, when he started inserting xerox collages on his canvases (many of these works appear in the book), or when the repetition of his main themes and characters becomes a bit boring. As for the book itself, if you like Basquiat, it is a must-have. If you don't like him, well..
