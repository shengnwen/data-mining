This book is an excellent introduction to the "big" history of modern-day Afghanistan, providing an overview of empire building and collapsing (either Afghans pushing outward or others pushing inwards), succeeding waves of tribes and armies moving through the region, etc.  For anyone interested in having an understanding of Afghanistan with some historical depth to it, this book is one I would, consequently, recommend.

Where the author falls flat, in my opinion, is when he begins to pontificate on how the United States should have pursued its intervention in that nation.  In this instance he betrays a minimal level of understanding ("where were the light parts of the 1st Infantry Division?" being a question he asks, apparently unaware that the current answer is that such don't exist, for instance).

The book does redeem itself a bit in looking at the future of Afghanistan, with the author proposing a rather novel notion of modelling the Afghan government on that of Switzerland.  The author makes a decent case for the idea, even if it might sound a bit odd.
