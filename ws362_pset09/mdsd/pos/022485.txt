     This book is about a shooting that occurs in Madison COunty High school. It starts out in an interview, and through the course of 3 interviews, police reports, and a diary, you will explore the lives of Cameron and Len, what life was like when they didn't fit in, having abusive parents, and getting pushed to the edge by bullies.    
  The book "Shooter" was a a very interesting and overall a very good book. One reason I liked it so much was because of the unique way in which it was written, as a compilation of interviews, police reports, and a diary. I thought it was really neat how he gave the perspectives of the three main characters, Len, Carla, and Cameron. Parts of it were disturbing and scary, especially the "turtle" incident. It was also strange with they way Cameron and Len thought about things, as you will find out in Len's Diary. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an intriguing book about people and the lives of troubled teenagers.
