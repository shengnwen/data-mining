I've read many recently published books on the substance and meaning of the Catholic faith--Weigel, Groome, Greeley, etc.  I've also read recent books by and about John Paul II, and Cardinal Ratzinger (Benedict XVI).  And, lots of historical, even famous, books of Catholic theology and apologetics: Newman, Chesterton, Merton, etc.   Lots of those books were very good, and each in their own way added a dimension to my own understanding of a faith I love.  But, David Scott's Catholic Passion is the single best book I've ever read on Catholicism.  

I cannot say I actually learned anything new (other than a few interesting facts about some saints I had not met before).  Rather, Scott captures the richness and joy Catholic life and belief, and with an easy prose encourages in the reader the attitude that a right understanding of Catholicism should inspire in all of us.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to discover or rediscover what it means and how it feels to be a Catholic.  It should be required reading for everyone involved in an RCIA program.  Catholics should buy a copy for their Protestant friends who may think (or are even sure) they know what Catholicism is about.  Mail a copy to that relative who has left the church.  

To be sure, this is not academic theology, nor a catechism lesson.  It is the inspired work of an author who loves his church, and who has found a way to communicate the best elements of that church, and his faith, to his readers.  Scott's book is the most honest and joyful expression of the faith in print today
