And what a history! As a rule I don't review novels on Amazon but THE HISTORIAN by Elizabeth Kostova is the best I have read in years. She creates a whole company of characters and you will like, or at least be interested in, and remember them all. If you like history, this is your novel. If you like mystery, this is your novel. If you like exotic locations and characters, well,,, you get the picture. When I recommended THE HISTORIAN to my mystery-loving wife she asked me if there was any suspense to the story. I told her that the suspense was such that I really hated to put it down. You will too from the first paragraph.
