The author has done a perfectly splendid job here of capturing both the essence of Burton's movies and the man behind the mask that is Tim Burton. Here is the first non-fannish, intelligent, and even intellectual approach  to Burton's work. The author's insights are keen and precise and,  thankfully, not colored by any sense of hero-worship. The films are  examined and not just mindlessly praised, which is much the same approach  taken with the director himself, who emerges as a far more interesting man  than the version of himself Burton presents to the public. If only the  publishers would see fit to allow an updating of this book to include  SLEEPY HOLLOW..
