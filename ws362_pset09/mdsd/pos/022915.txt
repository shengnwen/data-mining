This is an invaluable guide for tourists (and even some natives) who rarely venture beyond the familiar and sometimes very busy tourist traps and destinations.  I myself am familiar with areas such as Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties, the backcountry behind San Diego including Julian and the Borrego desert, and the Central Valley from Sacramento to Bakersfield, and have spent some enjoyable times in these places.  Don and Betty Martin have obviously visited these areas often amd done their research
