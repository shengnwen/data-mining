Chomsky provides yet another thoughtful and well-documented commentary on foreign and domestic policy.  It's necessary that citizens read this kind of work to know the realities of the world we live in.  This book does not provide the most well-rounded argument; however, it does provide a great lesson: educate yourself on the issues.  The media and government will not spoon feed you all the information. In fact they will instead spin information to achieve their own agenda.  So we owe it to ourselves as country to enter the political arena with our own opinions, not the opinion of the media or politicians, and demand how we want this country to be run.  That, after all, is what democracy is all about.

The lesson we learn from Chomsky is to always read between the lines; ask yourself, "what am I not being told?"  And the same rules should apply to his work as well.  So unlike some other reviewers here, I don't think Chomsky is trying to convince us of his political point of view, rather he is trying to open our eyes to the facts that we haven't been told and that haven't been made readily available to us.
