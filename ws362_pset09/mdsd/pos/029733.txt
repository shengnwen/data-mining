This is the most comprehensive workout/fitness trainer the I have seen. Complete with color pictures accompanied by written step by step instruction then catagorized by muscle group, this book is perfect for all levels of training ability. Frank's explanation is thorough and even the beginner will be able to preform the exercises.  The only thing that is truly lacking is the chapter on nutrition.  If a 200 pound woman tried to eat all of the protien, carbs and fat that this book recommends, she would never lose weight. All in all this is great book for training...find another book for nutrition
