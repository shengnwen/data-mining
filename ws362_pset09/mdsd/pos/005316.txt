"Bookstore Tourism" is a great little book and an even better idea.  The book delves into why it's so important to support indie bookstores, and how they're fighting for their lives against the large retail chains, not just B&N and Borders but WalMart and basically any other major conglomerate that sells books.  The ideas in the book are great and very helpful, telling people how to go about planning road trips with friends and other groups to towns with excellent independent bookstores.  It's an interesting, enjoyable read and I highly recommend it.  My only criticism is that it's too short and the author should expand it and do even more with the idea.  When is Bookstore Tourism Part 2 coming out like the author hinted
