Remembering Good Friends
I read this book about a sixteen-year-old boy named Buck Mendenhall who meets up with his friends a couple of years later. Kate Lucas and Trav Kirby. They all thought life was going great until they found out what best friends are really like. No one could understand their combining of each other. Buck realizes that he likes Kate. Kate doesn't have the same feelings for buck. After a while they all just start to drift apart. Buck feels that his friends don't like him as they once did. He feels lonely half of the time. He tries to put his feelings in front of his friendship.
      I like that buck has feelings for Kate and I think that's cute. I don't like all of the anger that is in this book though. I think this book is good because it keeps the reader wondering what is going to happen next. Sometimes the auther needs to think more about the readers point of view than his own.
I think that people who are into friendship stories and love wondering what is going to happen next would love to read this book. I also think people who like some action stories would love to read it to. A book called Father Figure is also like this book it keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. The author of this book is Richard Peck.
