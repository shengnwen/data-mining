Having never read Peyton Place, I didn't have the background that a lot of other people had reading this book.  However, I did enjoy the book and it kept me turning the pages.  It was my first Barbara Delinsky book, and although it was a little predictable, it was an easy to read and perfect for an afternoon at the beach.
