My grandson was very happy with this book.  He loves reading books by Dr. Seuss and knows when he comes to Grandma's house a new one will be waiting for him.  The book was presented as "used" but it looks brand new!  Delivery time was as promised.  Only negative comment for all the used books I have purchased thus far is that the postage charged has been far more than the book.
