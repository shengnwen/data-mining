For multimedia developers, this book is a great stepping stone.  It explains the entire copyright process, including what forms to fill when and why.  It also goes in depth about copyright infringment and attaining  rights.  As a bonus, it includes samples of library of congress forms, and  also contains the actual forms needed to apply for a copyright.  This book  is inexpensive, and i'd recommend to anyone
