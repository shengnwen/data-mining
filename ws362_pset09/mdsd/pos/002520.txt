Younger Next Year deals with what we all know: we need to eat better and to exercise more.  However, this book alerts us that we need more exercise than we may think if we want to remain active into our 80's and beyond.  This is not another book listing the workouts we need to be doing every day--it describes what the body needs and the stimuli to which it reacts, without burdening the reader with a list of workouts. Everyone over 40 should read this book.
