It has been said that Barry Goldwater ran for President in 1964 but was elected in 1980.  This refers to the fact that he set the stage for the movement, back in the 1960's, that set the stage for the Reagan revolution in 1980.  Goldwater energized a base of largely young conservatives and brought a whole new great of people into the process.

The book also tells us a lot of details of Goldwater's early life.  Most people probably don't realize the he is of Jewish heritage.  He worked hard his entire life to get where he was.  This is a strong contrast with the Kennedy family and many others (including George W. Bush) who were children of wealth.

The book gives an excellent account of Goldwater's entire career including his retirement in 1987....such that he ever really completely retired.

It is a faily well balanced book.....at least compared to most others.  It is clear, as others have said, that Goldberg approaches the subject from the left.  But it doesn't spoil the contents of the book and he doesn't revise history or distort Goldwater's record.  It is a fairly good account of a great man's life
