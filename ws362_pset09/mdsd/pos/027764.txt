This book holds a lot of thought for only 130 pages.  Franz Metcalf takes his knowledge of Buddhism to answer now just the big questions of "Life", but the smaller questions of daily life.  What would Buddha do or think about such subjects as failure, anger, road rage, gun control, lying, the environment, eating meat, money, sex, drinking, drug abuse, boredom and even prostitution.  Hard issues, but each is given a page, answered with a quote from Buddhist teaching and advice from the author.
Great gift for a friend or a gift for yourself.  It really helps you strip away the fat and get to the very core of the subject in question
