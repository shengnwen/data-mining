II am a professional corporate historian.  I research the corporate histories of many companies.  I have very few things on my desk that are permanent, of which, three are books--the Chicago Manual of Style, the newest Merriam Webster's Dictionary, and the Encyclopedia of American History (7th ed).  Whether you are a professional in the history field, a history "buff" or just an amateur social scientist, this is a book that you need to own.  The four sections of this book are extremely helpful when looking for grand historical events or the smallest tidbit of information.  While the internet is great for finding some of these items, this book is the most comprehensive volume of American History ever put together.  I highly recommend this book--it is worth the money
