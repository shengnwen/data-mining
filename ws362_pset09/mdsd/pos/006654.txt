This is a fine book on an important topic. My only caveat: it is somewhat dated by now. Still it is very well-done. Wheelwright first clearly outlines a conceptualization  of religion that explains the sky vs. earth religion dichotomy better than any introductory text I have ever seen. He explains the evolution of early Greek philosophy from religion in a  succinct and non-verbose way, and then in the bulk of the book he treats  each pre-Socratic philosopher and philosophical school carefully, clearly,  and intelligently, with a minimum of twentieth-century nonsense mixed in.  He uses plenty of fragments to illustrate his points. This is a really  lovely book. It will perhaps be less-than-useful for a graduate student in  Classics but for undergraduates and interested bystanders it will suffice  very well as an introduction. Highly recommended. After you  read it, however, you will need to read things more recent if you want to pursue the topic.
