David has written a compelling, honest and excellent tome on a diverse range of soul sisters some of whom have never received the mainstream recognition enjoyed by others.  That he would take time out to track down Ruby Johnson and Timi Yuro and include such soulful divas as Bettye Lavette, Maxine Brown and Carla Thomas is to his eternal credit; I'm hopeful that there will be a follow-up since there are other women who deserve the kind of truth-telling treatment he offers.  Bravo
