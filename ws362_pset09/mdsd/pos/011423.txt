I loved this book and I am not done with it yet. 95% though. 
The best advice I feel that they stress is for parents not to talk as much during discipline. That has really helped! 
As hard as it is, keep your comments in your head! LOL 
My husband & I are having a date next weekend and I am going to highlight the most important items for him so we can be on the same page. 
I would definately recommend this book.
