Offers an excellent overview of Asperger's Syndrome, including a translation of Hans Asperger's original dissertation.  The book is quite readable even for those  who do not have a technical background in the  field, but such a background will be very helpful in certain chapters.   While Asperger's syndrome is compared with classic autism, there is little  other material on classic autism itself, so the title is a bit misleading.   However, this is a must have book for professionals working with people who  have Asperger's syndrome.   Parents and educators may also want this book,  although they probably would not be satisfied with it as their only  reference
