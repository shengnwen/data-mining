Have to admit that I was also getting a bit tired of this series, but I couldn't put this installment down.

First of all, I liked the intercutting of other perspectives with Kinsey's (i.e., the flashbacks to 1953). I think these told you more about the characters than Kinsey could have, and I like that.

I also liked the fact that Grafton kept the reader guessing until pretty much the last dozen pages. There were 5 men with motives--all equally valid.  But which one was capable of murdering in cold blood?

Also, Grafton intersperses this with the usual wit--and of course she can't resist giving a key character a long-needed come-uppance which left me laughing out loud.  Justice is dispensed, but it only takes 34 years. But the point is that karma DOES catch up to you!

As for the complaints about small-town folk and stereotypes, well, I've lived in a small town as well as a big city, and sadly, in my experience, the stereotypes DO fit.

It's not great literature, but it's an engrossing and entertaining read. Definitely light and distracting fare for tough times
