How to Start a Magazine is a must read for anyone thinking about starting a magazine, and anyone currently in the business.   While the book targets the wanna-be publisher, it is also one of the best books I have read for experienced magazine professionals too.  Kobak masterfully describes all of the key competencies of magazine publishing in a straight forward no nonsense manner.  Unlike many texts on this subject, this book is full of practical real-life examples of what to do, and what watch out for.  The author also does an excellent job of exploring how to expand the business of established magazines into international markets, book publishing, list rentals and custom publishing.  This book is well worth your time and money
