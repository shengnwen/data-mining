This interesting and well written book examines developments in Nazi Germany to conduct a strategic bombing campaign against the United States following a successful invasion of the Soviet Union. Fortunately for the American people, the German invasion of Russia was not so successful. Had it been, Adolph Hitler would have had the resources available to produce enough long-range strategic bombers to pummel the American east coast.

The style of the book is a bit technologically oriented. Nonetheless, there is a great deal that the reader will find eye-opening.

First, are indications that the Nazis may have detonated two small atomic bombs late in the war, indicating that they were much further along in the development of atomic weapons than has been previously believed.

Certainly the portion of the book devoted to trans-Atlantic bombers is of tremendous interest, especially since the Third Reich's flying wings appear to be precursors of American Stealth aircraft.

The Germans also experimented with mid-air refueling for their bombers and the use of towed, winged fuel tanks.

I found the parts of the book devoted to submarine launched ballistic missiles and even submerged barge-launched ballistic missiles of particular interest, proving that there are few obstacles that human ingenuity and technology cannot overcome.

Finally, the author discusses the threat of Nazi weapons of mass destruction, especially chemical and biological weapons.

It is for good reason, then, that the Americans classified documents discussing all these developments for a period of 100 years following the Second World War. 

Particularly disturbing were hints by the author that some of the German WWII underground facilities, which may have numbered in the several hundreds, were never found. 

Could there be a Nazi flying wing, loaded with weapons of mass destruction, waiting in some long-forgotten underground hanger?

An interesting read
