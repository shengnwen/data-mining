I was not impressed when I received this book, with the quality of the paper or the overall presentation.  I thought some of the photography left much to be desired quality-wise.  However, it is quite a comprehensive book and I leaned on it considerably in my studies of furniture and design.  So don't let me put you off.  I just think that, with all the research and hard work involved, and considering the price, a better quality might have been forthcoming
