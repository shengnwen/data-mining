The first chapter is weak, because the author gives opinions not facts. The remainder of the book is very factual, well researched, well presented.
Europe has been very servile to the Arab world since the oil boycot of 1973. Servile meaning: paying lots of $ for oil, taking an anti-American and anti-Israeli stand, and allowing massive moslim immigration into Europe. The author shows all of this in great and chilling detail.
