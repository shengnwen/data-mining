Emily is a trust child, when she reaches 18 she will inherit several million dollars. Her mother is a cold-hearted society gold-digger. She married Emily's father for his money and has no time for Emily. Judge Montgomery is the perfect match for her mother. He is a cold, unfeeling child molestor. Emily has told no one about his attack, except to a web page for young people to tell their worse problems and what they want to do about it. The site is called Wishlist. com. Emily had detailed how she would kill the Judge, and that was exactly how he was killed.

I enjoyed the book but I felt that the leading characters were not so fully fleshed out. Conner gave up his hate alittle to easily. While not as good as SPEAK NO EVIL it is still a very good read
