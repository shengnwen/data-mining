This book literally changed my life.  Dr. Fuhrman presents a means of eating that makes sooo much sense.  Vegetables, fruits, nut, beans, seeds, and a little bit of whole grains are the focus of the diet, with large amounts of vegetable consumption.  Note: This book does not suggest that you become a vegetarian/vegan if you do not choose to.  I think some reviewers are getting the wrong idea.  Dr. Fuhrman says that you can consume some animal products, just a very limited amount (i.e. two to three servings per week).  The fabulous thing about this book is that everything is based on research and scientific studies.  The amount of scientific study sitings in this book is tremendous.  What most people aren't aware of is how this diet can be soo delicious.  I absolutely love eating this way and do not feel deprived in the slightest bit.  There are delicious recipies in the book and Dr. Fuhrman has even more recipies on his website.  Dr. Fuhrman is also known for having patients recover from serious conditions such as lupus, diabetes, high blood pressure, and more.  He has even had success helping people get rid of severe migraines.  If you buy Eat to Live and choose to follow it, be warned that you will no longer consume soda, white bagels, or candy anymore.  No processed sugars or high amounts of salt.  However, if you do follow the diet, your body will thank you in so many ways.  You will loose weight and feel much healthier in general.  If you have allergies or a runny nose, expect them to go away.  Mine did.  The reviewer below me suggests that the diet is too strict and that he will never give up his candy, meat, cheese, butter, etc.  Well, I feel sorry for him.  He is really missing out on a tremendous opportunity to turn his health around for the better, possibly adding years onto his life.
If you buy this book and follow the advice, be prepared to becoming a slimmer and healthier you.
