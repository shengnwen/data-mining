This is the first Oliver Sacks book I've read and I found it fascinating and informative.  Once I started a case history I was hard-put to stop reading until I found out the end result.  I particularly enjoyed the stories about the amnesiac Greg and the colorblind artist.  Sacks puts a human face on insights about how our brains work in an intellectually stimulating yet emotionally touching way.  I found the story about Virgil, the blind man who gets his sight back and must learn how to see in his 50s particularly heart-wrenching.  The only story I bailed out on was about an autistic woman who works in a cattle slaughterhouse.  (I could not handle the graphic nature of the story.)  I definitely recommend this book if you appreciate shows like Nova or if you watch Discovery television.  Anyone who wants to know more about the mysteries of our human brains will be enriched by this book
