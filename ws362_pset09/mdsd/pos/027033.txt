Levin has produced a rich, nuanced and detailed account of how complexity theory may further our understanding of ecological processes.  He does not shy away from the tough questions: How do ecosystems assemble themselves?  What is the relationship between an ecosystem's structure and function?  Does evolution increase the resiliency of an ecosystem?  In addressing these and other questions, Levin offers both real world examples and sophisticated theory. Regrettably, Levin often fails to distinguish between what he knows as a scientist and what he has decided to take on faith based on the statements of environmentalist advocacy groups.  As a result, the book is a strange amalgam of excellent &quot;popular&quot; science and overearnest environmental alarmism
