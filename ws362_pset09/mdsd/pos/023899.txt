I was given this book as a gift and I'm delighted with it.  It's sized smaller, like a gift book--so portable and easy to use.  I appreciate Rex-Johnson's introduction that focuses and guides consumers on ocean and fish sustainability.  This is befitting any bonafide cook from the Northwest (or anywhere!). Besides great recipes, she includes a helpful Appendix of techniques, everything from making bread crumbs to a chiffonade. The book seems basic enough, and sophisticated enough, for a broad range of cooking skills.  And the photos and presentation are beautiful, interwoven with historial trivia related to fishing. There's a lot in this little gem.
