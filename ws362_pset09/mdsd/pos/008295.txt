The prequel to the Newbery award winning Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry, this ninth book continues the saga of the Logan family.  It is the 1880's, and Paul-Edward Logan is the son of a white man and a black mother.  Raised on his father's plantation along side of his white half-brothers, young Paul-Edward has privileges not given to most southern blacks at that time.  His dream is to one day own land of his own.  It is not until Paul-Edward and his friend Mitchell strike out on their own is that he confronted with the racism, prejudice and violence common to black people.  Not accepted as white nor black, Paul-Edward must come to terms with his heritage and struggle to beat the odds to fulfill his dream. The Land starts out slow as Taylor builds up the characters, then moves rapidly through the boys' adolescence.  Some of the descriptive passages of racist or violent events as well as the boys' exploits to town while at the logging camp may be inappropriate for younger readers.  A definite must read for those who enjoyed Roll of Thunder.  Recommended for ages 12+ years ol
