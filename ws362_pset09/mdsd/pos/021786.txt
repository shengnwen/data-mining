This book is easily read while presenting information from the latest research in psychology, consciousness, and brain studies. I recommend this book for anyone interested in personal growth and self-knowledge. 

I learned about this book after I read Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. In fact, Gladwell notes on his blog [...]that Strangers to Ourselves is "probably the most influential book I've ever read." Blink basically describes the phenomenon of how we know something in the blink of an eye. Strangers to Ourselves provides the background information for what is going on under the covers. 

From a self-knowledge point of view, I found the catalogue of the contents and workings within the adaptive unconscious very interesting and extended my understanding of these elements. Wilson presents both information and interesting questions. One - found in the chapter of Who's in Charge: "But how do we recognize what our nonconscious needs and motives are? That is the million-dollar question. For now, I note simply that the ability to thing about and plan for the future endows humans with a tremendous advantage, but can be a two-edged sword. Following our conscious wishes can be problematic if they conflict with the desires of the adaptive unconscious."

He then goes on to describe: automatic versus controlled processing, the rigidity of the adaptive unconscious, and doing before knowing.

Wilson points out the difficulties in acquiring self knowledge because of the workings of the adaptive unconscious. He questions how much we can really know about ourselves - and his answer is not much. It is this point that I would disagree. I believe through the cultivation of insight and intuition one can come to know much about oneself - though it is an ongoing process.
