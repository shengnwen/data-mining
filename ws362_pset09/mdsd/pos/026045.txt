Linda McNeil creates a powerful picture in the minds of readers as she describes the effects of standardized testing on the education of the children in our classrooms.  Her book is one that delves deeply into the magnet schools, schools that display all the qualities that teachers would want to create in their classrooms.  These classrooms give teachers decisions on how and what is taught.  Students are critical thinkers and builders of knowledge.  Assessment is done in many forms, over time.  McNeil takes the reader back to a time when the reform began, time decided by non-educators to "nuke the educational system."  McNeil vividly describes examples of how the reformists took the learning out of the classroom.  How they listened least to the professionals on these matters, the educators actually sitting in the classrooms.  She gives chilling examples that make readers stare in disbelief at the words on the page.  One teacher was actually told that her observation would be continued when she was actually teaching, not when students were working cooperatively.  McNeil makes her opinion crystal clear about these reforms and reforms that have followed the Texas school reforms, for example, No Child Left Behind.  She is adamant in her views that this reform is strongly impeding the   education of those that it is intended to be helping, poor and minority students.  McNeil's book is one that causes teachers, both new and seasoned, to reflect upon the teaching that occurs in their classroom daily.  Are the reforms implemented by your state and nation affecting the teaching and learning in your classroom?  McNeil's book, Contradictions of School Reform will certainly help you assess yourself
