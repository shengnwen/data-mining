Even the standard text edition here, has a good-sized font. The Cambridge quality is unexcelled(unless by those of Allan Bibles of Glasgow). I am very grateful to the folks at Cambridge for installing a glossary at the back of the Bible to put the myriads of archaic words into modern, understandable English. Unfortunately, the Large Print Text edition does not have this almost-necessary feature. For an outstanding quality Text Edition, this is it. It also has a long ribbon marker, which a lot of companies are shortening, to the point where they only barely extend past the bottom of the page. Kudos to Cambridge. As an added note, I find the reviews by certain 'yaygs' who set themselves up as Theologians and criticise the very Word of God to be laughable at best, pathetic at worst
