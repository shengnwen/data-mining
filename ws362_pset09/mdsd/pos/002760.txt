Tree of Life written by Rochelle Strauss, Illustrated by Margot Thompson. I thought this book was a very unique and educational tool for informing children about Science, nature and life. The book is very detailed and is full of interesting information that will keep kids interested as well as decent pictures. Im not sure if i would purchase this book for my own home, but i would definately check it out from the library to share with my children
