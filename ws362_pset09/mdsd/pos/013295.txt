I had to read this book for my History class and found it interesting, despite the fact that it was required and I had to make a paper about it. I have absolutely no previous knowledge of U.S. History because I'm not from this country but I learned alot about slavery in America and actually understood it pretty well from reading this book. The book is not entirely about Gabriel's rebellion. Rather, it takes a more wholistic approach and actually puts together the identity, or how black slaves in Richmond, Virginia, thought of themselves and why they participated, or did not participate, in Gabriel's rebellion. In addition to this, the book reflects the experiences, beliefs and culture of the slaves in Richmond as well as the influences of other rebellions of that time to Gabriel's rebellion
