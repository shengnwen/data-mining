This book is a short read.  The pace and prose is circa 1959, but it fits this story very well.  It is the quintessential haunted house book and offers plenty of creepy moments, always subtle and handled with care, more psychodynamic than cheap surprises or thrills.  If you're looking for blood and guts or chase scenes this is not the book.  It ended a bit abruptly and I was not satisfied with the ending for Eleanor, felt a little cheated in the end.  Great book
