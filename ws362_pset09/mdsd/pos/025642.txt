Every mother will recognice all the feelings, if not the actual incidents, described in this book.  We've all had them, but only Ms Newman had the skill and wit to write them all down, validate our collective hysteria in those early years, and make us roar with laughter at it all.  There are twenty years of this madness ahead of her and I'm looking forward to reading about it (hopefully!) in her future writing
