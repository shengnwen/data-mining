There are few sources such as this one - EXHIBITION DESIGN - that share insider thoughts and plans and results of the process of presenting exhibitions in museums.  As such it is a welcome addition to the art lover's library, something to ponder when trying to discover why some exhibitions (despite the subject of the curated objects) make and impact while others feel cold and distant to all but the addicted lover of that particular subject.

Architect and exhibition designer David Dernie shares the mechanics and philosophies of current museums, pointing out the  current concepts of 'immersion, interaction, and multisensory experiential approach' have moved from the purely entertainment field into the realm of the once rather sterile filed of exhibition design.  His thoughts are amply illustrated by architectural renderings and photographs that, while informative, are not of the quality one would expect from a book on museum wisdom!  But the elements of psychological significance on how to present art to the public eye to enhance the experience of viewing are sound ones, and in his words 'how objects are arranged will determine the nature of the message they communicate.'
