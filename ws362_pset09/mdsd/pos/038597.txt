This was my first reading of the Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures. I was curious about the character and the saga after the movie Sahara with Mathew McConaughey and this book only came to confirm the impression i had after the film.
These adventures are absolutely stuning and breathtaking. Suspense is served in big gulps and when you think the hero is finished, his amazing cockiness opens an escape with a optimistic and fearless action. The mistery on this particular story is very well explored. It's like a ghost haunted house in which they're set to find the farse behind the myth.
It's a reading on a next-page basis grabbing you by the lower parts untill you finish!
You will put this one on the top of your "Favourite Books" after read it
