I am a huge fan of Daniel Goleman.  He's the bestselling author who coined the term "Emotional Intelligence" with his 1995 book of the same name.  Now he's got a new book, "Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships."  Social intelligence is the ability to read other people's cues and then act on them.  Life is all about relationships, and there is a science to how we relate to each other.  It's fascinating to see how Goleman breaks down each aspect of communication.  We can learn how to more effectively express ourselves so that we feel understood.  And we can learn how to better "read" other people so that we can better understand.  This helps to improve our interactions and ultimately strengthen our relationships.  He talks about "synchrony" or interacting smoothly at the nonverbal level, which is an important, yet often overlooked, part of relating.  Goleman also scientifically explains "the capacity for joy" and how that affects our social intelligence.  He shows how our resilience plays an important role in our happiness, which comes into play as we express ourselves to others
