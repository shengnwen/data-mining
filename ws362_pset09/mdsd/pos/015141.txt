I got so caught up in Lukeman's exercises for Inner and Outer Characterizations that I had to actually force myself to put the book (and my rather extensive but still unfinished profile for a protagonist in my story) and WRITE.

Even though I'm writing a "fan-fiction" based on a TV show, the story I am crafting puts the character in a far more complicated situation than the show had really allowed for. As such, I found I needed to delve deeper, deducing some character traits from what was presented in the show, and creating the rest in harmony with that.

I had no idea how to do that, or how deeply some traits would matter, until I came across this book as a resource listed on Suite101.com's online class for writing mysteries.

As a result, if I ever finish this story, my protagonists will be richly dealt with. Thank you, Noah!
