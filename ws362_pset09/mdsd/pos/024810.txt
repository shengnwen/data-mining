Lady Glencora Palliser is dead.  This must be understood or nothing wonderful can come of this tale.  The last installment of Trollope's Palliser series begins with this sad development.  Long Victorian faces grow even longer with grief.  Now ex-Prime Minster, Plantagenet Palliser must cope alone with the foibles of his three adult children.  As the reader discovers, their expectations are not consistent with their father's ideas.  Typical of Anthony Trollope, the story unfolds leisurely for 600+ pages.  Regardless, the quiet little story urges one to keep turning the pages.  19th century British politics, social customs, and romantic attitudes seem quaint, even amusing, by today's standards.  Much as the writings of Jane Austen, reconciling marriage and money drive the story.  Trollope's elegant style is a delight.  The reader is lulled into a quiet sense of relaxation.  No great truths or insights to report, but good downtime reading.  Appreciate the novel as you would a fine painting or a delicate antique tea set.  If one seeks a pleasant diversion from the noise, clatter, and electronics of modern life this is recommended reading.  Relish the experience. ;-
