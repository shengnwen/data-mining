I am not a mathematician, a logician or a philosopher, but a lay man with interest in all three areas. As Comp Sci major, I was familiar with Godel as the one who provided the foundation for some of what Turing did, but I did not know the theorems or their implications well enough. This book, my first on the topic, made them all both interesting and understandable. It provides a biographical (albeit sketchy) account of Godel's life, but primarily focusses on his work. The author sets up the table for the context and the potential implications of the proof in two elaborate sections of the book before actually presenting the theorems and their proofs. The proofs are explained with patience and clarity, and since they have been set up well, it is not difficult to understand them. I cannot say with certainty that I fully understand the import of these findings after reading this book, but I guess that is the nature of the beast. It has definitely triggered a great curiousity in me to read more on the subject
