I enjoyed this book, but I can understand why some people were disappointed.  This was not what I was expecting from the title, i.e., an orderly comparison of European society before and after the plague.  I happen to enjoy the type of book that this is, and I wasn't reading it for a particular purpose, so the surprise didn't bother me.   On the other hand, if I had really wanted what I expected, I might have been very annoyed.

The book is only loosely organized.  The chapters are almost independent from one another.   I found them quite intriguing.  I love books that toss around ideas, even if they raise questions that cannot really be answered.  Cantor brings up a number of possibilities about the medical aspects of the plague - was it really two concurrent plagues?   Did it come from outer space?  Do animals other than rats and their fleas spread it?  Did the death of particular people alter history?  The writing is very lively and readable.

It might have been better if I had read another, more standard history of the plague before this, but I intend to make up that lack; I thank other reviewers for their recommendations.  I'm no medievalist, so I am somewhat uneasy about some of the complaints about accuracy.   I know that some of them are off-base, and that others may be a matter of interpretation, but altogether, I will take this a little more cautiously than I might have.   I suspect that another reviewer is correct that Cantor has misinterpreted life expectancy statistics, which is one of my pet peeves.

Another issue is that Cantor editorializes about upper classes, describing King Edward III of England as a thug.  He does concede that in his own time, Edward was greatly admired (of course the question is, by whom?)   I found it amusing, and acceptable since both sides were presented, and this was a relatively informal book, but the prospective reader will have to decide this personally.
