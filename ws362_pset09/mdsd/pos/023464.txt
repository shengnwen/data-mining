I use this book as my first point of reference for all those technical details regarding HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and the Document Object Model (DOM). What I really like about this reference tome (1000+ pages) is how every element, tag, attribute, etc. clearly denotes which browser/browser version supports the item. It's nice to be able to carry around a single book that can answer so many questions. Highly recommended
