This is a great book to give you an idea of how people from different walks of life handle homeschooling. Every story is different, and I can't imagine someone not being able to relate or connect to anyone in the book. It also has some information about different resources to help you do a little research. 

I liked the fact that these stories were about the way people lived, and how they incorporated homeschooling into their lives. These families didn't have any of the "socialization" problems that so many people believe that homeschoolers have. It's great for anyone who wants to know "what a day in the life" is like.
