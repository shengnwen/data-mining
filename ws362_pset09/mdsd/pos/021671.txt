I found this book, with many fine pictures and clear instructions to be very useful, at least for an intermediate skier who wants to improve.  I particularly liked the recognition that there is more than one &quot;right way&quot; to ski.  I question whether a complete novice could learn without instruction using this book, but the beginners section would probably be a good guide for instructors on useful beginners exercises
