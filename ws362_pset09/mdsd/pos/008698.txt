this is an essential resource for any playwright as it lists all the theaters and orgs that are interested in new work.  it has complete information which allows the writer to research the theater by going to the web site to investigate the type of plays they perform.  i dont know how writers would know where to submit plays if this book didnt exist.
my only complaint is that this book took so long in getting published this year.  i buy a new edition every year and the calendar for play submissions runs from sept thru aug. every month i would check to see if this book had been released and was unable to purchase it until january! which means i had missed deadlines for four months of contests -- one third of the book no longer valid.  this book should be reduced 8% for every month the information becomes out dated.  nevertheless, it is still a great resource as it has other information regarding grants, professional orgs -- and a writer should research potential theaters year-round, not only when they are conducting contests
