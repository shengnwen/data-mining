I read some of the reviews here... and there was a comment in one of them that says: "it's NOT QUITE a sequel to Alice In Wonderland because although Alice is older, she doesn't recall her past experience in wonderland."

Well...  isn't that to be expected?  How many dreams to you remember for the long term?  None?

Alice DID change by the end of the first book -- but she may have forgotten exactly WHY she changed... because dreams just don't stay with people very well.

Also keep in mind that the author was a wierd drugged up stoner.  So -- yeah... on all accounts -- I think this can be expected. 

It's a good read.
