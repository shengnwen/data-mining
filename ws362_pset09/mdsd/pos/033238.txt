The idea of a vampire book being funny may seem strange, but this series defintiely makes me laugh!

I wasn't sure what to expect, but the book is a riot! Sure, she's dead. Or undead. But why let that make you lose your sense of humor? Or your love of designer shoes? 

She's a vampire.  She's sarcastic. She has a warped sense of humor.  But she's determined not to let the whole not-alive thing get in her way. What's not to love?

I've seen these books called romance, but don't really think of them in that genre.  As with many other series books, there's a guy in the picture, but the focus of the story isn't romance or horror.
