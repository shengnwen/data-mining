Okay, so this is book number 42.  I have felt, at times, that Jim Davis was running out of funny stories when it comes to Garfield.

This book, however, has been refreshingly funny.  I enjoyed the read and found myself laughing out loud quite a few times.  The bright colors and the nice compact size of the book helped also.

Still too short - as always (this is a theme for me with comic books), but still a good purchase
