Bamford has done an enormous job in his extraordinary book "Body of secrets." He clearly and copiously dissected the most powerful spying agency on the face of the earth. His research is opulent and his writing is excellent. "Body of secrets" will provide the reader with a fascinating analysis of the most surreptitious spying agency that has ever been assembled.
I would highly recommend this book and gives it a definite    two thumbs up !!
