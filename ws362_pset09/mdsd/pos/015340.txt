I loath Dickens. His appeal to sentiment and tedious articulation of enlightened English Methodist benevolence rescuing decrepitude and industrial exploitation following the growth of empire only finally found a critic from the likes of George Orwell. His opaque prose and tedious one-note themes echoed and re-echoed from every angle wear you down far after they have become transparent. Most of his works are better experienced as summaries. Yet Our Mutual Friend is Dickens's finest work, and in it he exceeds himself. It deserves a wider audience.

As middlebrows embrace "A Christmas Carol" and "Oliver Twist" those of us with more mature tastes can turn with comfort to Dickens's final works, the uncompleted fragment "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" and "Our Mutual Friend." In MoED, Dickens explores repression and self-repression, and rebellion, with murder as the result. With OMF, Dickens explores some familiar territory, yet a gothic sensibility pervades, and indeed is both unresolved, and resolved, for the theme is death, and towards that inescapable fate Dickens never lets up. This is Dickens's darkest work, and perhaps his most personal, for throughout we glimpse characters struggling with the unanswerable, and also coming to no resolution. Dickens mercifully has no pat answer for this ambiguity, and indeed because of this breakthrough after a lifetime of literary treacle he finally writes something worth reading. Get it today
