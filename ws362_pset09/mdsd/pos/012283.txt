I do not know where to start.  I read Nora Roberts all the time and this is by far my favorite of her trilogies.  There is a little of everything.  Sorcery, vampires, witches, time travel, battles and of course romance.  Do not even think about it just get the book and find a quiet place to settle down and get started
