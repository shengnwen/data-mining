If you hang out on the backside of the racetrack, you have extra bits of time to just sit on an overturned bucket and read. You would think of all of the stories that happen on the racetrack just in one day, there would be a lot more books on the subject. The connections for the 70+ horses that race each day at any given track are worth at least one novel each. 

Three Strides Before the Wire. by Elizabeth Mitchell is a compelling read about the backside of racing in this century. It is the book to read after you've read Seabiscuit for the umteenth time. The book tells the story behind the scenes of Charismatic's run for the 1999 Roses.  It also tells a bit about trainer D. Wayne Lucas, jockey Chris Antley, and the Ramsey's owners of Charismatic.
The book is authentic. It is a compelling read.
