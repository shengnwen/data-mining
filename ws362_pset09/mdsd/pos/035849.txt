    Moby Dick, by Herman Melville, is a four star book.
    I gave Moby Dick a four star rating for its eciting and adventurous plot. Its a quest for revenge on the dreaded white whale, Moby Dick. The book gives details about what it is like on a whaling ship, like how they hose down the barrels of oil. The conditions and why certain things are done to keep the cargo safe are described perfectly. The way Herman describes how they hunt the whale down and how the whale is killed is grueling but true. When they make the oil come out of the whale's body is described some horrifying, disgusting way. With a few sudden twist in events, Moby Dick is a book anyone can read.
   Ishmael is a young school teacher who is seeking adventure out on the ocean. When he meets an cannibal indian at a local inn named Queequee, they become the best of friends. They now are going to sign up on a whaling ship in Nantucket called the Pequed, whose captain is the mysterious captain Ahab. Altough the crew knows many things about whaling, trouble still finds them. Through te sea they meet other ship who have fought the white whale. It all comes down to this, a duel between Ahab and Moby Dick. Who will win? Read this exciting book and see.
   Other tittles I reccomend are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer & The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I am a seventh grader at Harris Road Middle School.
