The movie "The Celluloid Closet" is great, but you 
occasionally get the feeling that the directors
are straining to make a point about homosexuality
in old movies. But you never feel this way reading
Russo's book. Russo is not a gifted prose stylist,
the writing of the book is wel, it's prosaic, but
he's a good writer with a keen eye and an excellent
memory. If you've seen the movie and enjoyed it get this 
book to complete the experience
