It was a stroke of pure brilliance that caused Nancy Mitford to write this literary masterpiece. A simple yet elegant story, taking place in the early 1900's. Witty, tragic, and romantic, you will rejoice with the Alconleighs' success, and sigh at their failures, and laugh all the time in between. Immensely well-written, it was an excellent story and a true classic
