If you're familiar with the Amelia books, this is a continuation of the zany antics of the gal who just "takes things literally."  In this edition, Amelia, poor thing, just cannot get it together to play in the school orchestra.  She tries and by the end of the story, finds herself rolling into a bass drum and stealing the show.  You know it's going to be band when the story begins with Amelia being instructed to pick up the conductor.  Well, she tries to "pick up the conductor" of the local train but says, "I tried to pick him up but he just preferred to walk."  And, on it goes from there.  The guest conductor finally arrives and Amelia decides to help him out with the rehearsal and the performance.  The conductor finally gets Amelia locked into a room and instructs her not to come out until her cue but well, she misses her cue and runs into the bass drum.  It's a very cute story about misconceptions and how we should all clarify what we mean.  Honestly, if we all took literally what we said then we would all be Amelia Bedelias.  Great story, we have to read this one quite a bit in our house at bedtime.  Very funny stuff
