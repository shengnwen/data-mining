I was outraged that a first time offense could land this mother in prison for 15 to life is that justice No matter fact Hell to the No. Are drugs bad in the community well of course Yes. Although what she did was wrong by carrying those drugs to Albany she and her children should not have had to suffer sixteen years without her even five years would have been stiff but sufficient. I read one reviewer state that she was committing welfare fraud by working under the table and a host of other things anyway. But different people look at things differently you see I was born where Elaine was born and when our mothers went out and worked under the table it was called survival. When young white teens are allowed to work under the table it is called "teaching them responsibility" People kill me how they are so ready to judge. Anyway I once again will reiterate that in no way do I agree with her carrying any drugs because my mother was addicted to drugs which royally screwed up my family BUT before anyone judges Elaine let's look at this a young mother with four children working on the side is very vunerable to be lured into the situation she was lured into by George Deets. And to think good people allowed this to happen and are still allowing this to happen cause' why is Nathan still sitting in prison for four ounces worth of cocaine.
   To the Author I applaud you for writing Elaine's story with DIGNITY
