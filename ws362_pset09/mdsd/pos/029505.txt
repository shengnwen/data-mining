I have just started to get interested in the details of the multiple Israeli wars and this was my choice on the Yom Kippur war.  As a war history book, it lacks details.  Does not mention the US fleet in the area, that "confronted" the Russian naval forces in order to keep both countries out of direct contact during the war.
The book is a good story, but while we are told of the love story between Yossi and his wife, there is a lack of "where are they now".
Over 300 pages on build up/war and 2 pages on how it ended.  
While the book is a good read, I will have to read another one, as many q's are still unanswered
