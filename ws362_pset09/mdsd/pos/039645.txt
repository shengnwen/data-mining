as to the long sentences, well, yes, this is a song, so, the writing, well, here's a quote:
"Then she forgot it, standing by the fire getting out of her blue things, one by one.  She found it sweet to do that, so slowly, and to have [name] kiss her at last when there was no bar to kisses, lying with him then, with the light put out and the radiance of the fire on the walls and ceiling.  And she turned to him at last, whispering and tender for him, We're daft, we'll catch cold without anything on! and then she saw his face beside her, solemn and strange, yet not strange at all.  And he put his left hand below her neck, and he took her close to him, and they were one flesh, one and together; and far into the morning she woke, and was not cold at all, him holding her so, and then she heard the hand of winter write on the window, and listened a moment, happy, happy, and fell fast asleep till morning brought Mistress Melon and two great cups of tea to waken [name] and herself."
so, i guess the writer (the name Gibbon being a pseudonym by the way) could've simply said, "They had sex." 
proust, too, wrote long sentences, and a whole bunch of other great authors, and guess what? i love them all, and this is a great book with beautiful writing and characters and a great sense of humor to boot.  if you have any doubts, just read the prelude, and if it doesn't make you smile and want to keep reading, then poo!  as for me, im off to read the remainder of the trilogy.
