I highly recommend this book. I have tried 4 recipes so far and they really were easy and tasty. I wasn't able to make the crepes because my equipment wasn't very good but I just substituted tortillas!! It is a little more work than I am used to in the kitchen, but it is worth it because they food is so much more interesting with just a little more effort
