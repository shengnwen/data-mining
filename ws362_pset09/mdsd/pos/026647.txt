This lengthy work draws together information from a wide variety of sources in an attempt to give interpretations of symbols.  The book is perhaps the most ambitious compilation of symbol interpretations ever to have been assembled.

On the negative side, the book is, unfortunately, poorly edited, with many typos, grammatical errors and misspellings.  Also, some symbol interpretations are somewhat farfetched.  The author's interpretation of Biblical symbolism is particularly weak, perhaps due in part to his apparent anti-Christian bias.  Also, he misses many important Freudian and Jungian interpretations of symbols.

This having been said, for a given symbol this book gives a great deal of material which can be used as a starting point to understanding the meaning of the symbol.
