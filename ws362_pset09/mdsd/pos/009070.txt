Got this book for my first batch.  Still refer to it now.  This thin manual is all you need to know for your first batch, and even has a (not complete) section on all-grain.  While charlie's &quot;joy of&quot; is still a neccesity for first timers, this book contains all the bare-bones info you need and you will need for your first and consecutive batches, without the editorializing and romanticizing of &quot;joy of&quot;
