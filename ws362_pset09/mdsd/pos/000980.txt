Puzo really takes you back to pre-war "Hells Kitchen".  His descriptions are vivid and engaging.  Like many of his other books,  this one is about family.  The reader is shown a struggling mother and her children over a 20 year period.  The two female characters (mother and oldest daughter) are truly heroic.  It is by their there virtue and perseverance thatt this family can stay together and ultimately prosper. They are the rock that their family and this story are built upon.  Its a testament of how stong women can pull a family up by its bootstraps despite the failings of the men.

Puzo's use of Italian (proper, dialect and slang) brings the characters close to home for those readers of Italian-American decent.  The vartious Italian-American characters brought back memories of long since past members of my own family.  

This book really places your in 1920s-30s new york with all its splendor, virtues, vices and difficulties.  It showed me what life was like for my grandparents, aunts and uncles.

This was a very good book that I will read again someday.
