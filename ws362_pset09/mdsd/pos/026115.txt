I'll let you in on a secret- I am 29 and I love this book!  I have no patience for cooking, becoming frustrated at recipes that call for too many ingredients and too many steps.  That's why this book is perfect for me!  The recipes are simple, no fancy ingredients, no time consuming steps, yet the results are delicious.  I cooked up the Cinnamon Rolls the other day and my friend thought that they were store-bought.  They were so easy to make yet so good.  If you are a big kid who doesn't like cooking, check this book out
