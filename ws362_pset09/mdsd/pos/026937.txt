Tired of trying to climb the ladder to being a top model, Morgan Allgood realizes because of her age, gigs are becoming few and far between.  While watching a football game, she wonders if she has the potential to become a sideline commentator.  After researching the possibility, Morgan travels to Chicago for an interview with ESPN.  Having just left the interview, she spots the dashingly handsome weatherman Van McNeil.  It has been eight long months since their last encounter, one she has never forgotten.

Van had been a child when he first laid eyes on Morgan, and from that day on he knew that she would become his wife.  So when Van sees her again, memories of him walking out on their first date resurface.  His problem--will Morgan forgive him for his past mistakes.  Once he regains her confidence, they share a night of intimacy but this time when all is said and done, Morgan walks out of his apartment and his life.  Knowing she has made a big mistake by sleeping with Van, Morgan seeks refuge at her friend's clothing design studio.  To keep from thinking about him she channels all her energy into making a wedding dress; she has been procrastinating about for months, for her sister.  With wedding dress in hand, Morgan dashes off to the airport to catch a flight home to Atlanta.  However, when her flight is delayed indefinitely and there are no rental cars available, her only recourse is to ask Van for a ride.  

Kim Louise's latest installment in the Allgood series is one that is sure to please.  Morgan and Van's story was very realistic.  Their trek home was heartfelt, funny, adventurous and full of zany characters they encountered along the way.  Although, I own several of Ms. Louise's novels, this is my second in the Allgood series.  If you are looking for a book that will make you laugh, cry and then laugh some more, then WITH OPEN ARMS is just for you.
