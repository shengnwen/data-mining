A lot of people think that "Nicholas Nickleby" is a bit of disorganized confusion, but I think it's a pretty good effort.  It is one of Dickens' earlier works, and he certainly did get better as time went on, but there is greatness here too.  Dickens is noted for his social commentaries with his books, and with this one he took shots at an actual private school -  Dotheby's Hall and it's master Wackford Squeer - and the book actually did cause reforms to be implemented in the infamous school.  The hero Nicholas is the handsome, warm-hearted son of a widow whose husband's death left her and her two children impoverished.  With the help of a shrewd, miserly uncle, Nicholas obtains a post at Dotheby's Hall.  Nicholas finds conditions at the school impossible to tolerate, so he thrashes his employer and quits in disgust.  The rest of the book outlines Nicholas' life in London.  There are a lot of characters in this book, and it's difficult to keep them all straight, but Dickens' skill for characterization shows itself even in this early work, and the reader gets to know and love each one.  The plot is a bit melodramatic and complicated, but the characters almost carry that failing through.  Certainly worth a read
