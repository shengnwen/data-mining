This is an impressive piece of historical fiction - well researched and well told. While Vlad Dracula is certainly a famous, or infamous,  historical figure, not a lot has been written about his world. Augustyn  does a very good job of introducing the average history buff, such as  myself, to the region and time. Augustyn is clearly a revisionist. By  placing Dracula in historical context, he demonstrates that his subject's  bad reputation is at least partially unfair. One can understand how Dracula  is still considered a national hero in Romania.  The bottom line of what  makes this book work is that it tells an interesting story. It reads like a  fictional thriller. I do not understand why the book has not received more  main stream attention
