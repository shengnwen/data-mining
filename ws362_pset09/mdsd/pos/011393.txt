This is a FANTASTIC book.  The story, while it has wording that is difficult to follow at first, depicts how our assumptions cause all kinds of mayhem and actually my deter us from our destiny.  

I HIGHLY recommend this book.  I read at night before bed... and there were some nights I stayed up until 4 reading.
