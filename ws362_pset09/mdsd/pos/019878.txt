I read the review by publishers weekly.  Whilst i agreee that it helps to have read the previous Wilson book, the plot is NOT too complex.  Rather this book is a sophisticated and engaging read, not a Richard North Patterson novel written for USA Today reading simpletons.
Wilson is a great writer who happens to write mystery novels.  Yes, the beginning of his newest book is a tad slow, but it is worth the wait.  The twists in the story are compelling and the nature of the crimes truly troubling.  Readers of this book will not be disappointed
