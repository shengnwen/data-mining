Nancy Mitford is not the author to look to if you like your history full of facts and wars and power politics.  Nancy Mitford takes a difference approach, one more concerned with how simply delightful things (especially  French things) were before that really vulgar revolution took all the fun  out of being an aristocrat.  She sees Voltaire as not only the pre-eminent  humanist philosopher and writer of his time, but also as a sentimental fool  who just could not help but run off with the lovely, but rather too  intellectual Marquise de Chatelet. They kept getting into all sorts of  elegant French trouble with the censors and the court, all the while being  dreadfully brilliant about the whole state of the world. Delicious scamps!  Miss Mitford's historic accuracy is not in question, nor are her skills as  a writer or biographer.  But she is more of a gossip than not, and is  certainly more of an unmitigated snob about the French aristocracy than  some down-to-earth readers might like.  I for one adore this cosy, catty  biography, and find it a welcome anecdote to the tons of weighty tomes on  Voltaire and his endless epistolary relationships.  Miss Mitford writes  pastry -- light, airy and fluffy and yummy. She lets the others serve up  full-course histories, heavy, balanced, probably good for you, but so often  bland as oatmeal as just as charming
