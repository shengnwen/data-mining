In the 8th grade I did a project about the protests against the Vietnam war i nteh 1960's.  THis book was my main reference. it has pictures, quotes, lines from songs, and all-over great information. I would reccomend this book to just about anyone who just felt like learning something new about the &quot;flower child&quot; era. (It was the best of times, it was the worst of times) this is a great book, and it was fun to read, in spite of it being for a grade. I really encourage you to read this book
