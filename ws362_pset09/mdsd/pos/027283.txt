I was given this book and it set by my bedside for several weeks. Once I picked it up I was pulled into one of the best bike travel stories I have read. I could not put it down. Lynette gives a glimpse of Cuba and it's people that is unique. She is somehow able to get inside and connect with the people. She let's us see a country of poor but proud individuals yearning for a better life. Her since of humor allows us to laugh and enjoy her many encounters with humanity on it's most basic level.
