The book starts with the legend of the thornbird - a bird who searches all his life for a thorn bush and once he finds it, impales himself on the thorn and while doing so sings the most beautiful song, even better that that of a lark or a nightingale and the song is so beautiful that even God smiles. 

For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain. 

This single sentence seems to sum up the common element binding the entire book.

The Thornbirds is the story of the Cleary family, and their journey from their unpretentious roots in New Zealand where they worked as sheep shearers, to the huge Australian sheep farm Drogheda, owned by Paddy Cleary's autocratic sister. The family being Irish, the land is in their blood and from the time that they arrive on Drogheda the land plays a unmistakeable part in their fortunes and destinies. The story spans 3 generations from Paddy Cleary and his wife Fiona, their sons and only daughter Meggie and the Catholic priest Ralph De Bricassart, to Meggie's children - the exotic actress Justine and priest Dane.

But we see all this mostly through the interaction of Meggie with her family and her forbidden love for Father Ralph.

The author Colleen McCullough has a wonderful descriptive style of writing. From the the dry dust, heat and flies of the Australian Outback, the relentless forces of nature like storms, drought, wildfires, to the power-hungry corridors of the Vatican all are brought to life in the pages of this book. And the element of love and pain is dealt with in a balanced way and not over excessively.

However, only the main characters are really 3D, and I often found myself skipping through large parts of the book that didn't interest me.

Overall it is a must read as it makes us realize love is not just demanding and wanting its more so about giving and sacrificing
