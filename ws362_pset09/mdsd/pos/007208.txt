This book really brought Chick Hearn back to life for me...I LOVED IT!  It contained so many facinating memories from Chick and those close to him.  Also, the accompanying CD with excerpts of Chick's calls from many games cleverly strung together...his Chickisms....was an added treat.  For anyone who followed Chick during his career I highly recommend this book!
