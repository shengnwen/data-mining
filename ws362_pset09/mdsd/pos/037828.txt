Let me start by saying that I am utterly uneducated when it comes to science. With that said, I found this book very readable and also enjoyable. The author's humor and smooth writing style made it a relatively easy read also. I am not that into science but the topic of genetics really intrigues me. This was a great introduction to the subject and from what I understand is also very up to date
