I just reread this book after 35 years.  I loved it as a 15 year old and enjoyed it as an adult.  The negatives?  The hubrus of Cooper, the successful author, shows up in the form of undeveloped characters and a wandering plot.  The positives are the rolicking adventure and the way it makes me remember where I was and what I was doing the first time I read it.  If you are under 16 read this on first and the rest just get better.  Over 16 read them in the order they were written and try not to be too disappointed in with this later effort
