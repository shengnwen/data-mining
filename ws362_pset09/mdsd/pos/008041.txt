This is to serve as a rebutal to the earlier so- called review.  De Man's war time involvement with the Dutch fascists was indeed unfortunate, as was Heideggar's espousal of nazism, as well Eliade's support of the Romanian  fascists.  This does not however take away from the beauty of their  literary and philisophical works.  Something that as a Jew I have had to  grapple with. Derrida is an Algerian Jew, and was Paul de Man's close  friend. His approach to reading is principly an ethical one. Perhaps you  should turn your attention to his book on de Man. And perhaps also, you  should reread the above book, or first read some other books on  deconstruction, as your characterization of it was terribly off base.   Deconstruction in it's Derridean form is extremely subtle, requiring a  mental agility to grasp the closeness of it's readings. You would be doing  yourself a service by reapproaching it more with an attentive honestness  not exhibited in the above review.      As to the book in question, I have  always enjoyed Paul de Man's work, however if you are not familiar with  continental philosophy it may not be the best opening into that  world-Derrida, Delueze, Cixous and later Hedeggar may prove more  stimulating and enjoyable
