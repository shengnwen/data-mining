My book is called On The Devil's Court.The author of this book is Carl Deuker. This book is a cross between fantasy and realistic fiction.
Joe is a 17 year old red head that is tall and only passion is basketball. His dad is a really smart scientist. Joe's dad wants his son to be like him and go to stanford with straight a's but Joe doesnt want to. Joe moved from Boston with a promise from his dad to beable to go to a public school. Joe meets some friends like Ross, he goes to a public school that Joe wants to go to. Joe and Ross get in a lot of trouble togather and Joe gets caught by his parents so they force him to go to a private school. Joe wants to fit in so he sells his soul to the devil so he can be good at basketball. His team makes it to the state championship against the public school team who has Ross, who had become his worst enemy, on it. 
I really liked this book. I think it is appropreiate for middle schoolers and up.
