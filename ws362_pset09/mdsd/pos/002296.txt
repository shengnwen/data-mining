John Pina Craven's The Silent War is written by a genius, a patriot and an important figure of our Cold War victory.  Those who have criticized the book on the basis of its chronicling of the author's  recollection of his own role in the events depicted must suffer from their own inferiority complexes; Craven was there, and he played the role he played.  That's history, folks.  Blind Man's Bluff, which predated his book and which he did NOT write, confirms this.  Finally, as one who has had the privilege and pleasure of sitting down with him and hearing some of the exploits of those he writes about, I can report that he is a true patriot and a man of peace, who did what he did to prevent war at all costs - billions but worth every penny.
