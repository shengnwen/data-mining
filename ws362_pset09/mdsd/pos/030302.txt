I'm halfway through this book and have already received great advice on how to treat my 3 boys in various situations.  They have 3 very different personalities, and I definitely see ways I can improve my parenting with them by following most of the guidelines in my book.  I have realized that spanking is not the way, and it only makes my youngest madder.  Positive re-inforcement is much more helpful.  I gave the book 4 stars because I don't agree with everyhing the author says - like he doesn't believe that children under the age of 9 need choices - I find giving them choices gives them improved self esteem and a sense of control over their lives.  That being said, there are some great ideas in this book I intend to put to use
