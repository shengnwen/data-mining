I would have given this work 5 stars if it was a bit more up to date. I expect great things out of the new version slated to arrive in May 2006. One thing that I really like about this work is that it does not just focus of Mid-east terror, but looks at ETA, IRA, US Militia movements, RAF, and other groups as well. A very good historical background with some good insights about rationality and media exposure
