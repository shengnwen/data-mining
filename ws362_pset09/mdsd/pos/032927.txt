Speak With the Dead: Seven Methods for Spirit Communication, is actually a new name for the old book, "Contact The Other Side: seven methods......   Not sure if it is page for page the same material.  

Konstantinos put everything here in a format to help someone who has never seen a ghost or had evidence of one appear begin to notice the subtle traces around them.  Slowly but surely if you stick with the books methods until you notice them work you are sure to learn alot more about the afterlife, LIFE ITSELF, and ghosts.  Their not the hollywood entertainment you are used to seeing... so it's not for those who want to be like "Ghostbusters" chasing spirts.  But for those who want to study, I don't know of a better book. 

Easiest method in this book is the feedback loop with a webcam.  I had some interesting results with this as I got down into the method.  I still have not tried some of these methods but most are work very well.

Konstantinos is very true in his writings.  I can't think of a better person to write these techniques in the way he does.
