"Planetary" is a nice mix of traditional comics story-telling and more offbeat, challenging fare like the works of Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, etc.  It's traditional in that its various issues involve such comics and popular fiction icons like superheroes, Godzilla-type monsters, pulp adventure heroes, multiple universes, and the like.  It's offbeat because it treats those subjects in a darker, edgier way than we're used to seeing.  

For example, "Planetary" posits that if there really were superheroes, they probably wouldn't be as white-bread pure as in the typical Marvel or DC offering (indeed, this series' version of the Fantastic Four, seen toward the end of this volume, is shaping up to be the villainous presence of the series).  This idea is nothing new, of course, if you've read Alan Moore's "Watchmen", various DC/Vertigo titles, and other titles aimed at the "for mature readers" crowd on the shelves these days. But while "Planetary" definitely gets edgy, dark, and challenging like those works, it also celebrates popular comic book storytelling by giving us enthusiastic action scenes, big set pieces, exciting revelations, etc., genuinely having fun with the fact that in many ways it's a regular ol' comic book.  "Planetary" has it both ways and revels in it.

This initial collection includes the first six issues of the original comics series, along with the short, appetite-whetting "Planetary" preview story that ran in the back of a couple of other comics titles just prior to this series' debut.  

Are mainstream superhero comics a little bland for you these days, but you also find the edgier, adult fare out there not as exciting and engaging as you like your comics to be?  Give the heroic investigators of "Planetary" a shot.  I'll bet you won't be sorry.
