"As an honorary member of the Western American Explorers' Club in San Francisco, I feel sincerely that I owe the first accounting of my extraordinary adventure to that illustrious fraternity." Professor William Waterman Sherman just wanted to get away from teaching arithmetic when he left on a balloon voyage for a year, but he didn't get a balloon voyage, he received a balloon disaster.

In the book 'The Twenty-One Balloons', the captain of the freighter S.S. Cunningham finds this man in the Atlantic Ocean with a wreckage of twenty balloons, and the whole world want to know his story, but because of the Professor's extreme loyalty, they have to wait. Professor Sherman finally tells his story of an unusual adventure. When he has a balloon accident, he lands on the small island of Krakatoa. There he meets the islanders and learns of ther abnormal ways, which include a gourmet government, a volcano, and houses built on diamond foundations. But when this active volcano erupts, what will happen? Will these strange but humourous people survive?

'The Twenty-One Ballons' is totally original and is a stupendous, fast read. Du Bois has written it with so much creativity which wouldn't be expected in the case of a balloon accident. This fantasy tale is funny and full of excitement and wonder.
