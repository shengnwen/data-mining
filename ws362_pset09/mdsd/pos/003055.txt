This compiliation of fairy stories is amazing! I enjoyed all of them greatly. I liked Tengu Mountain, The Price of Glamour, Never Never, Imersed in Matter, The Shooter at the Heartcock Waterhole, and The Annals of Eelin-Ok the best. At first I wasn't going to read it because it was so long, but I liked it so much it took me 3 days to read 350 pages. I couldn't stop! I liked this book so much because the stories are all so different and unique. The faries are all so different, and so I never got bored. Never Never was the same plot as Peter Pan, just told in the point of view of Captain Hook. If you want to read a book that is fun, interesting, and a great journey, read the Faery Reel
