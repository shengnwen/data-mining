It's putting the quirky details together that makes this book more revealing than the standard saccharin drenched puff piece.

For example, Hepburn is quoted as saying that she wears a size 8 1/2 shoe, while the author clearly states later in the book that Hepburn wore a size ten.

Her mother's quotes, if accurate, provide convincing evidence that the Baroness Von Heemstra was more than a little jealous of her far more beautiful daughter.

The author's claim that Audrey "didn't eat during times of stress" directly contradicts close friends Audrey Wilder and Doris Brynner, who claimed that  Hepburn loved to eat.  As for her staying so thin due to malnutrition that  "permanently altered her metabolism", this is unlikely.   According to the author, Hepburn speaks of gaining twenty pounds early in her career. Other bios confirm this.  Perhaps in later years Hepburn simply watched what she ate.

According to the author, Hepburn washed her hair every four or five days.  She SMOKED.  Whew, draw your OWN conclusions about that one! 

I've found Robert Wolders a bit creepy ever since I read about him in "Queenie",  a superb biography of Merle Oberon.  From Merle to Audrey to Shirlee Fonda; this guy clearly has a THING for wealthy, older glamour girls. He's always described as an actor/businessman. Hmmmmmmm.

An additional strength of this book is its focus on her personal fashion philosophy--not just her association with Givenchy.

Audrey Hepburn is my absolute favorite and always will be.  She had many lessons to teach; not only about beauty and elegance, but also about tolerance, grace and kindness. No star of today can compare.

 PS-I'm just tucking into the Barry Paris book, which is FAR more in depth. I recommend following Audrey Style with this one if you haven't already read it
