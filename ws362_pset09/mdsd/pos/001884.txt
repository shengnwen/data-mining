If you want to talk about 'truth in advertising,' it'd be this book! It amazes me that some people approach the book expecting some kind of "fair and balanced" journey through Catholic history when the book's title baldly and plainly proclaims its author's ideology from the outset.

All that aside, Crocker writes with a palpable love of the triumphant side of Catholic history. The book is not definitive, and certainly does not claim to be. However, just as "A People's History of the United States" and "A Patriot's History of the United States" are both polemical, yet valid, so too is "Triumph" a skewed, but nonetheless valid and important, point of view. The volume is essentially for Roman Catholics who want to celebrate their faith's rich heritage, although it holds a good deal of interest for tolerant people of all kinds, Christian or not.

The book tends to gloss over Roman Catholic failings, especially when discussing the Renaissance popes and the imperialistic papacies of Innocent III and Boniface VIII. Crocker's treatment of the Reformation in particular is devastatingly biting with regards to Protestantism, and no enemy of Catholicism will enjoy his treatment of the non-Catholic Christian communions. Crocker's historical research, however, is impeccable (though colored throughout by his INTERPRETATION of those historical events).

Nevertheless, Crocker's book is exactly what he and those who reviewed it claim it is: a vigorous, pro-Catholic journey through the history of Christianity's oldest church, and while you may not agree with everything (or anything) he says, there's no doubt that he makes the ride a very enjoyable, and even side-splittingly funny, experience
