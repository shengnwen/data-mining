The first time I saw this book, I was literally overwhelmed by the quality  of the images I was seeing: Beautiful, revealing color photographs of  magnificent woodworking tools the likes of which I had never seen before.  This is THE book for any tool enthusiast; an absolutely MUST HAVE book for  any woodworker, or a terrific gift for the tool fancier on your gift list
