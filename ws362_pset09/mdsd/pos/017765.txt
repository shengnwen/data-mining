LeDoux is clearly brilliant. He's accomplished an enormous feat in distilling scientific knowledge on emotions and the brain into a 300-page text. He clearly has his finger on the pulse in this rapidly evolving field, and he knows how to explain complex and competing neurodevelopmental theories in a fair and balanced manner. 

At the same time, I would hesitate to recommend this book for anyone without a fairly good grasp of science. It gets pretty technical, and bogs down in explanations and counter-explanations. Further impeding the flow is LeDoux's incessant name-dropping. I think what he's trying to do is humanize the field by naming and describing all of the players in all of the many experiments, but it get a bit much after a while. In addition, I was disappointed at the brevity and superficiality of the discussion of emotions other than fear. 

Overall, these are fairly minor criticisms. If you are looking for a single source on what's known and what's yet to be discovered in brain science, this might be it. It's definitely a wide-ranging, up-to-date survey of the field, and LeDoux presents the information in a compelling and impartial style
