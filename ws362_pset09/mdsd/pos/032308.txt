One must remember when reading Dr. Berne's book on the games we play that it was written over 40 years ago which makes it a far more ground-breaking work than one may suppose. It's brief but exudes many timeless truths about the nature of human beings. It's important for me to note for potential readers that his transactional psychological viewpoint does not derive from the separate mathematical field of game theory. That's a completely different discipline. The titles he uses for the games we play were inventive as was his choice of using acronyms to describe them. One example is IWFY for "If it Weren't for You." Dr. Berne's work is an intriguing starting or middle point for those people interested in the way we relate to one another.
