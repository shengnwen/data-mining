I picked this book up at the public library. It's not for beginners .  The thing I liked most about it was the steady introduction of advanced chord forms.  The end of the book has a unique introduction to the Coltrane and Parker cycles that I thought were very interesting.  I still can't play them but they give me much to think about.  If you can get your hand on this book it's a good book to start with Jazz concepts.  I'm giving it four stars because I didn't feel that it was easy to follow
