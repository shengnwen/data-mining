If you love poetry, if you love the rhythm of life danced in words, look here. Many of the poets in this book would undoubtedly be more compelling heard live, but three outstanding writers take you inside and outside of  yourself--Carl Hancock Rux, a long articulate cry; &quot;The mountains have  not known me this way/the tenements with their secret apartments/have never  noticed the details of my feet/This is even more than I've ever known about  myself/the sound that comes from my throat/when I am surrendering to ocean  currents, rejoicing at my endurance.&quot; The wit and sensuality of Tish  Benson: &quot;I wanna go to the pit of yo soul/afix myself between it and a  moon in full bloom/croonin for u like a bayou geechie woman in heat and  thankin God/that the world will know what shoulda been all along:/u a bad  Boogaloosa Louisiana booga&quot;. But for me it is the words of Ava Chin  that take me truly away from my own puny thoughts, on trips through  generations, conversations with the present and past. Her intelligence and  talent make me dizzy. &quot;If I could breathe her in and out of me/would I  be able to sew the most intricate garment/with the lightest thread?&quot
