I ordered this book from firesidesellers and after much waiting and anticipating, they couldn't get it to me.  So I bought it locally.  In any case, the book is a great collection of very short stories, some by rather famous authors.  I needed it for a class, but I'd recommend it to anyone who's into very short fiction for any reason whatsoever
