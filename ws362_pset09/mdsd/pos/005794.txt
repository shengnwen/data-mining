I love the style of the author a lot. But if you are looking for some more comprehensive and less abstract but more applied oriented book, go for Hubbard's. Also if you want to just master the TECHNIQUES of Linear Algebra, try Harold Edwards' Linear Algebra--This is a very standard classic type of book written by a great mathematician
