This is a excellent book. The use of oscillators to fine tune buying real estate was a first for me. I am a futures trader so using charts and oscillators makes sence to me. Robert Campbell makes it easy reading for anyone. Here in Australia some of the data Robert uses is unavailable so we have to modifiy it a bit. In the USA I think it would be the best way to go about buying real estate.Timing any market is of the essence and Robert has wrote a extremely useful book on the subject.Robert takes a hard subject and makes it easy to understand a sign of a gifted author.
I would rate this book 10/10. If you are interested in real estate you should buy this book
