I had this Babar book as a child and could not resist buying it for my daughter, and I am so happy that I did.  This book is so incredible, the pictures and colors so vibrant and the text so incredibly addictive, that your child wil carry it with her forever.  I know I have.  I was stunned by how much of the dialogue and how many of the pictures I remembered.  This book is a reasure that you and your children will share for years to come.  Some people my comment about some of the themes, but as a child they went over my head, and as an adult, I recognized how tastefully done they are.  Highest possible recommendatio
