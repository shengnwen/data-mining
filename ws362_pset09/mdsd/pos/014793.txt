I agree with the other reviewers. In general this is good book. It bridges the gaps between many computer science disciplines. Especially OS and programming language. It also touched a little bit on computer architecture and linking process. The text was written in a a very clear way. However, I do have two complains. The author didn't spend enough effort on the relatively more complex and advanced topics. Eg, linking process for C++, advanced topics in memory leakage detection and prevention. On the other hand, author spent too much energy describing linked data structure in terms of serialization. I personally don't think its relevance is higher than the advanced memory leakage issues. For seasoned profressionals, this book can be used to refresh your knowledge. It is a beginner level to intermediate level book.
