Crews does a first- rate demolition job on a number of Freudian theories. These speculative theories according to Crews have been subject to no true empirical test, and thus have no real weight of evidence beyond them. One would only have wished that Crews while debunking Freud nonetheless would have acknowledged him to be a true pioneer in the overall human effort to understand ourselves, primarily through his bringing to general consciousness the central importance of sexuality in our lives.
Crews also takes apart other irrationalities , repressed memory theory which he believes has been misused to bring unproveable false accusations , intelligent design ( which he argues presents a false alternative to Darwinian evolution) 
Crews also argues for a complete split between Science and Religion and formulates the view that only the empirical methods of science have given us tested and reliable insight into Nature.
It is my feeling that it is not only  possible but truly wise to share his positive valuation of scientific method and work, his contempt for many of the irrational absurdities which mankind has fallen, and will continue to fall for- without dismissing religious faith, and the hope given to much of mankind by belief in a personal God.
