I was under the impression that this was a book discussing abandonment recovery; however, this is the story of a little girl abandoned in the woods by her father.  This story goes through the emotions and feelings this girl experiences in her journey.  Although, I did enjoy this story and was able to grasp the concepts the story was illustrating, I was looking for a book more like Susan Anderson's other book on abandonment recovery
