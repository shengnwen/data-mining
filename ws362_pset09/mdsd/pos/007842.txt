The novel by John Ball is exciting from start to finish because every page is signifacant and important. The details described by Mr. Ball is so vivid that I felt as if I was actually besides Virgil Tibbs, who is a black  detective in Wells. He is convicted of a murder, mainly because of his skin  color. But mr. Tibbs proves that he is a 15 yr. vet as an investigator for  the Pasedena Police Department. He helps the inexperience of the wells  police by solving the immposible murder case. Mr. Ball uses descriptive  action verbs and adjectives that captures the readers attention. This is a  geat mystery novel because Mr. Tibbs reminds me of a great detective named  Sherlock Holmes
