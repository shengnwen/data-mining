This book really leaves you wanting more. The author is definitely a pull; I was interested in the story until nearly the end. But like other reviewers, I found that it seemed as if the author just had to finish the story and quickly wrapped it up in two pages. So you get a great and interesting story and then BOOM! Wrap everything up in a couple of paragraphs. I was also heartily disappointed in Will, the 'hero' of the novel. He was never around, and besides his great opening line, we really don't get to see much of him. I absolutely cannot understand how Keeley felt she knew him at all. She constantly jumped to conclusions about him and he about her during the 10 paragraphs in the novel they spent together. 

Keep your eye on this author; she's definitely interesting, but I think there has to be more
