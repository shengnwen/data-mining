For those who cannot get enough of the life of "Anne of Green Gables" creator L. M. Montgomery, this book may be the perfect solution to that problem.  The album is stuffed with pictures and information about anything the reader could possibly want to know, and perhaps a few things he or she had never thought to ask.  Though the book is supposed to be scholarly work, there is relatively few critical pieces of anything about the life and world of Montgomery.  Perhaps in a few years a more balanced approach will be published
