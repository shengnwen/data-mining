This is one of the finest personal allegories I've ever read.  I was struck by the literary quality of the work -- quality which wasn't sacrificed by a quantity of painful emotional content.  The ending was NOT  unhappy or cynical; it was an expression of an artist, an insightful social  satirist trying to be honest enough to, at the end of his life, turn that  insight onto himself.  The result is astonishing, a powerful account of one  man retrieving the disparate parts of his self after a life of physical and  spiritual fragmentation
