This book is subtitled 'The essential reference to their lives and work'.  I'm not sure that I agree with the word 'essential' but it is certainly a very useful source of Bronte-related facts, links and events.

I believe that this book would be a useful addition to any library as it contains the biographical facts related to the Brontes, synopses of each of the published novels and a good bibliography for those who want to do further in-depth research.

The book also contains a handy chronology and the A to Z contains details of each of the Brontes and names of those significant in their lives as well as names of characters in the books.

Recommended for those who want to know more about the Brontes but who are not (yet) ready to jump into some of the more scholarly works available.
