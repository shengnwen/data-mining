I was fascinated by Miller's ability to express honestly his search for the Christ that he somehow always knew that he needed to believe. His statement that he knows that the chances of having theology completely correct were about a million to one ought to hit all of us square in the face. This book, though not at all that scriptural, like scripture, rings true in places that we least expect it.
It is fairly obvious that Mr. MIller has a great intellect, one that I pretend to have sometimes, and it is delightful that with that intellect, he still somehow stumbles onto the Truth of the Gospel. It is that intellectualism, I believe, that most fundamentalist evangelicals fear the most.(I say most, only because I guess I am one too.) How many times have we all failed in our attempts to "explain" our belief in Jesus as God to an intellectually sharp person and left that encounter actively, furiously building defenses about why we failed, only to be left with the realization that either our theology is flawed, or the person is reprobate, doomed, predestined for hell, a child of Satan, and chose to embrace any or all of the latter rather than allow a challenge to our belief system.
I don't know how much of this theology is wrong, but I, for one, am willing to accept any that profess to belive in Jesus, and let the Holy Spirit do the leading and guiding into all truth. I would that all intellectual pursuits lead to Miller's conclusions
