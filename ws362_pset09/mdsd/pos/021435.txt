I was referred to this awesome book by another fellow entrepreneur. I am extremely glad that I was too! The Art of Profitability is all about "profit models". What is a profit model? A profit model is made up of the core parts of a business system that have a direct influence on how the profit happens for a business. Basically the key factors for how a business turns a profit. 

What if there was a book that defined and explored several profit models that have a track record of success and gave you real world examples of where they work? This means, from now on, instead of trying to magically dream up the best way for how the profit should happen in your business ventures, you have several existing patterns to use as a guide. 

Let me give you a quick example of just one of the profit models described in the book...This one is called the "Pyramid" profit model. The Pyramid profit model is where a business sells multiple products/services at different price points, targeted to a different type of buyer. An example of this in the real world would be Mercedes automobiles. They have different classes of cars targeted to different groups of buyers. Sometimes customers buy into the brand at one price point and over time move up the pyramid and buy at higher price points. Some Pyramid profit models implement a "Firewall" product/service. This is where the lowest item on the pyramid is sold cheaply and efficiently in order to maintain market share and draw people into the brand. 

This book is very profound and useful. The common bottom line in business is profit. How profit happens should really be one of the most intense studies of every entrepreneur. Start with reading The Art of Profitability right away
