I love the book because it has a huge variety of what Srini and unamerican.com did... however it was missing some of my favorites from back in the day, such as "arm the homeless" and "drugs help alot." When I got it, I was happy to see the ones that were there, but my only complaint was that when I finished I was disappointed to not see some of the classics.
