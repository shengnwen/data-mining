This is a really good addition to the Amelia Peabody series.  For one thing we have the entire family with Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, Nefret, both cats and Emerson's brother Walter and his wife Evelyn.  In this book we have Emerson on the verge of discovering an almost unheard of unopened tomb.  The word of that gets the vultures circling, and there are two unscrupulous groups of people after the contents of this tomb.  Amelia and her family are caught in the middle, and there is much danger to them all.  The book moves fast and keeps the reader turning pages in order to see what happens next.  This is a wonderfully entertaining series
