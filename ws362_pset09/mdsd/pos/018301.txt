This isn't just for husbands.  Wives should read it to get a husbands perspective.  But it did help me relate more to what my husband is going through and how men deal.  I started reading it half way through my chemo so I read a lot of what we experienced and some of the ways he responded to certain situations.  It was also great to read the personal experiences of different couples who have gone through or are going through breast cancer
