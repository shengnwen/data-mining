This was another great novel by Michael Crichton. This book starts out quick with the killing of the eight group members, then it slows down to introduce the characters including a gorilla that understands sign language. The gorilla will help them out in the end... They will find some other stuff that they didn't expect to come across including diamonds and the terror that took the lives of the first group of members.

Once the story gets going though, you can't stop reading it, you'll never want to put it down. There is a lots of twist and turns that will suprise you. If you enjoy a good science fiction then you will enjoy both the technology and the story. If you don't enjoy science fiction, if you can see past the hubble in the beginning with the systems, you will still enjoy this story. It's a good book for everyone
