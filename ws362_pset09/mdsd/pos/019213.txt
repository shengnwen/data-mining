We used this book as a brainstorming tool for our company's 
strategic planning process.  I was spellbound by the vivid
descriptions and illustrative examples.  It is amazing how 
 Ms. Popcorn and her firm can visualize the macro forces 
 affecting our lives now and into the future.  I highly 
 recommend this book -- it really opened my eyes to the
 &quot;big picture&quot;
