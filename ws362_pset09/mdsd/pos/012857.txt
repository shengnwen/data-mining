When I first began to read 'The Bonds of Womenhood' I found the concepts general and the progress slow.  Despite this slow start, Nancy Cott's work soon pulls you in to her convincing arguments and compelling presentation.  By the conclusion one can appreciate the structure of the argument as much as the message, history, and interpretation she conveys in the text.  I recommend this book to those who wish to begin a modern and fair interpretation of Gender history and Women's issues.  There are few scholarly books that are enjoyable to read and this one in particular is commendable
