This entire book is a stream-of-conscious reminiscence of a 39-year-old Dublin widow.  Nobody else speaks, except through her memory. It is a memory that has lost one-fourth of her life due to abuse of alcohol and abuse of herself by her husband.  She doesn't remember anything from the 80s.  She is a mother of four; it would have been five, except she fell down stairs, or walked into a door, or something.  She's waiting desperately for someone to ask her.  Ask her what really happened.  But, nobody does.  Nurses take her word for being clumsy.  Doctors look at body parts, but never at her.  Nobody asks.  So, she continues taking it because she loves him, and he loves her.  That's her belief and she's sticking to it. As Doyle has shown us in previous books, such as The Commitments and The Snapper, he knows how to capture the spirit of the Irish.  He has certainly done it with Paula Spencer, nee O'Leary.  There is not a false note anywhere in this book.  If you have any feelings at all, you will get caught up in her tale of woe.  But, don't take me wrong.  It's not all horror.  There are laughs and smiles aplenty along the way; after all, this is the Irish.  Then comes the day when the husband goes too far.  It's interesting to contemplate who she is telling her life story to; she indicates that she might be writing it down.  But why, and for whom.  It's a quick read with the pages flying by as we become emotionally committed to the life that is portrayed within
