I usually don't like romance novels because of their predictabilty but Waller's Bridges of Madison County breaks through the genre with emotional characters and thought provoking morality questions.     The Bridges of Madison County leaves you questioning your ideals as you attempt to justify or condemn the affairs of the two main characters.  Honestly the writing is average but the setting and the purity of the character's emotions make this story work.

Clearly the most interesting aspect of this book is the polarity in peoples reactions to it.  It's a deeply personal tale and those that can relate to it probably are the ones that can appreciate it.  Does it glorify adultry?  Perhaps, but the stars were alligned in this affair which makes it easier to accept and enjoy from a readers standpoint.  Which ever side of the fence you fall on will also probably determine if you like this book or not.  I say probably because personally I disagreed with what the characters were doing but the beauty of the whole literary experience made the book enjoyable.  I guess in the end I rationalized that this was fiction and that I didn't have to take a stance.

I haven't seen the movie nor do I have any desire to since Maryl Streep and Eastwood are way too old to be these characters in my mind.

Bottom Line:  An interesting look on the dichotomy between the simplicity and complexity of a marital affair.  What some find beautifull and pure, others will find abhorent and ugly..
