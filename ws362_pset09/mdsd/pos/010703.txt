C.J. Box's Joe Pickett adventures seem to very in style with each novel.  The initial Open Season was a surreal not quite but almost Carl Hiaasen type novel, then Savage Run turned the series into a more traditional thriller type of adventure.  Trophy Hunt introduced a very far fetched paranormal element into the series and I am glad to say that Out of Range has none of that and is a return to the traditional believable realistic type thriller.  In fact I would have to say this is my favourite of the Joe Pickett adventures.  However I would strongly suggest reading these books in order, starting with Open Season as parts of previous novels are given away in subsequent ones and Out of Range is certainly no exception to that.     

In Out of Range the game warden in the larger neighbourly district Jackson, Wyoming is found dead with everyone including Joe in disbelief that he would kill himself.  Since the hunting season starts earlier there Joe is ordered to temporarily take over that district and since his daughters are in school he decides to leave his family behind in Saddlestring.  In Jackson Joe encounters much resistance to his presence there from everyone from the local police to the Parks Department financial officer who points out at every opportunity how much Joe's career is costing the department.  With his wife getting more and more upset with him, not realising he doesn't have the opportunities or time to ring her as often as she'd like both are tempted by opportunities from the opposite sex.  It soon becomes apparent to Joe he is leading former game warden Will's life in more ways than one, and there is substantial danger to his in doing so.
