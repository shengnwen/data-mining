I picked up the first Stephanie Plum novel out of curiousity and wasn't disappointed.  I've gone on to read every book in the series and have enjoyed every one.  Rarely does a book have me laughing out loud, but I do with each one of these.

The characters are wonderful.  Grandma Mazur is great.  She may be old, but she doesn't let that stop her.  She'll try anything, anytime.  I love Ranger and Joe.  If I had two guys like that in my life, I'd have a hard time deciding between them too.  I love the family dinners.  The conversations are hilarious.  You can picture Stephanie's dad trying so hard to tune everyone out and not quite succeeding.  And Lula!  She gets better with every book.

Sure the situations and the characters can be a little out there at times, but isn't that what makes a great book?  I love to get lost in a good book and tune out everything around me.  I'm starting the 11th book next, I already have #12 and can't wait for the 13th to come out.

I recommend this series to everyone.  Give it a chance and read it for what it's supposed to be, escapism.  There's too little of that these days and I think we all need it to some point in our lives
