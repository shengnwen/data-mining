A Slant of Sun is a beautiful book written about a boy whose dignity and integrity teach his mother many things.   This book is not an appropriate selection for parents who are seeking a plan of action or a series of steps to take toward a child's wholeness; the author makes it clear, repeatedly, that what worked well for her child is not necessarily a prescription for all children.  Instead, A Slant of Sun is a book for those who believe it is important to step back, to spend time with their children, and to learn the lessons that they teach.  It is a book for those who have been profoundly moved by their own child's first words, by unexpected gestures of love
