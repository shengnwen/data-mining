Bill Rancic, the dashing winner of the first season of  Donald Trump's runaway-hit reality show The Apprentice admits on the back sleeve of his book You're Hired: How to Succeed in Business and Life that he never went to business school and that he doesn't believe that business theory can be learned from a book.  What then is the affable Mr. Rancic doing offering advice on good and  ethical business practices?  Making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame, that's what.  In two hundred pages, he lays out the formula for his own success that led to him beat out 215,000 applicants to become the Donald's first `Apprentice.'  The reader is privy to Mr. Rancic's early entrepreneurial efforts, businesses that whet his appetite for something larger.  Readers are also witness to his failures and mishaps that threatened to derail his ambition.  Through it all, Rancic recounts the lessons he's learned, persons he's admired, falls from which he's risen.  He offers opinions on Kwame Jackson, his fellow runner-up to the Apprentice title, and `deceitful' Omarosa, whom many believed was the cause of Jackson's loss.  He also details lessons he's learned on goals, values, strategies, leadership, vision, and success.  While business school grads may scoff at Rancic's straight-shooting and simplistic advice, it is less idealistic than The One Minute Manager series of books.  Here, Rancic seems to be offering advice to the everyman and everywoman looking to get a better hold on the direction and management of their lives in pursuit of their goals and dreams.  The result is one that is as memorable, yet as pleasing, as a tall glass of lemonade.
