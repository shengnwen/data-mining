I started an online book study with my 3 daughters using this book.  All three of them are long distances away.  This book has really opened up some great discussions and opened up their hearts to the Lord and the beauty of being a woman.  One of my daughters said "That's exactly how I feel!  I hated myself for feeling that way, but now I realize that is the way God made me!"  It has helped us see ourseves and our wonderful Lord in new ways.  Very recommended.  Read it with someone you love!
