Greider states the progression of capital and it effect without regulation.The conduct of  those today in the corporate state have the same character,as during the industrial Revolution.Keep in mind that US business in foreign nations profits by any means to cut cost.Also the boarder with Mexico is the best example for those who up hold the slave labor which has been pooring into the US because of trade agreements.Outsourcing started in the sixties.At that time the middleclass thought it would not effect them,so they did not care.There are many today who still think the same way.Jobs across the board are being taken by foreigners.This includes high tech.Are the middleclass upholding their income,are the middleclass doing better today in relation to income on a percent basis.Are there more or less middleclass,answer less,why.Because of outsourcing,and the increase of immigrants into US.

Being educated does not mean you are smart if it involves being brainwashed,For if you are you cannot see,and you will not act.The communist said we would bury ourselves, or words to that effect.

Greider gives you the history of why and how we are where we are.

To put it in simple terms.Reduce the cost of labor,sell on volume.Reduce the margin of profit,knockout the competition,and centralize the control of production,for what end, the new world order.One world,one culture,one king.Crazy,who says so.

The governments say they have to reduce the standard of living of the nations to compete with Asia,but they do not say that in plain words because they know you will not buy it.EU,France,Holland,no vote.They want a peoples bill of rights,why do you think they voted no.

Who owns the largest percent of US bonds, mutual funds are they invested internationally.What influence does this have,and there is no end to the selling of america,and the buying of america.

Do you really believe we have to expand,without Asia we are dead, it may be the reverse.Could the western nations get along without the business of Asia.Who benefits,and for how long,and at what cost Is europe getting along now without the EU vote no.

Greider explains what is going on.You have to sellout,find cheaper and cheaper,and cheaper labor,and if you do not do what business wants they will leave your country,and the country will lose money ,so the governments have to walk the line This means no benefits to people.Keep producing products at cheaper cost untill you sell at less than cost,and maybe you will go out of business,and in the mean time totally exploit the country.Who benefits.

Greider says this and much more in detail,the shame is that thoes who become aware generally say nothing,so what is the point.If you want to exist you have to make an effort.Banks lone money,and one could be a slave to them.Could the governments be acting like banks.Who is running the governments.Could it be banks.Redundant,and simple.
