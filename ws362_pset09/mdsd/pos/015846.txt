Although I think the secondary characters could use a little more attention, the primary ones are well drawn and believable. It's a well-turned plot, though I wish everyoine involved: author, editor, and whoever wrote the jacket blurb, would have been a little more circumspect with clues. One reviewer complained of southern stereotyping; I say: barely. I lived in the area for a couple of years, and the description sounds eerily familiar to me. I had an owner of an extensive marina complex tell me once, "I AM the law on Magnolia Point!" (geographical name changed.) just like Taylor in the book. Out in the country the way "things work" is accurately described. And sorry, but people DO use "Y'all" in the singular. Perhaps they shouldn't, but they do.  In any case, since there is now a sequel, we know DeMarco survived. I'm looking forward to the next one.
