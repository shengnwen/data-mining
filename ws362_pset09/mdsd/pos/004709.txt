... the basic plot's the work of a genius. Roland and his Tet are carriors of the task to save a "Calla" village from an attack of so - called wolves. The task is fulfilled perfectly, so the newly grown Tet's about to move on which they'd love to do - BUT...

As I said above, the basical happenings are chosen and mostly also narrated afantastically, if the author would only have kept it a LITTLE shorter. E.G. the new Tet member's self - told biography shows some details which don't really wanna fit into the actual Tower story at all; all they show is how the guy came into this world, still Midworld, of course. 
Most of the rest, however, is told fantastically, as I said above. When Eddie comes to talk to Calvin Tower about the house ground with the Rose on it ("Waste Lands" readers will know what I mean) or Susannah's mind is caught by another person, differently said: Detta and Odetta receive company, those facts are told GREAT!!
