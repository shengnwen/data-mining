The writing of this medieval mystic, contemporary with St. Teresa of Avila, is, as the title implies, very dark.  As a translation, it is quite good.  As general reading, the reader should be aware that St. John's philosophy is difficult to read, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with personal issues dealing with guilt, shame, etc
