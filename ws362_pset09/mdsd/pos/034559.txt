This is one of the best written fitness books out there (and I've read a ton of 'em). Fenton covers topics from how to start a beginning walking program to competetive speed walking, and everything in between. It's well written and presented and is actually fun to read.  More importantly, you'll learn it's fun to walk for fitness. A great start for beginners, but also a good motivator for seasoned exercisers
