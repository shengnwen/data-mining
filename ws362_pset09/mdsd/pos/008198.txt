Even when my baby was under one month old, he would stare at the colorful pictures on the pages-- he would stare at the left page and then the right.  I knew the book was stimulating his growing brain and I was giddy with excitement!!   Now that my baby is 8 months old and he likes to hold the book himself, I appreciate the rounded corners and thick cardboard pages (so baby won't get paper cuts).  My baby likes to gnaw on the book so I guess it's also a great teething toy
