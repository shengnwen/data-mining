The review by "Mr. Big," which for some reason appears twice, is so riddled with inaccuracies and errors that it is unworthy of  Amazon.com. The references to the Jesuits as "popes" is sickening. The one thing that Jesuits have never been is "popes." Lacouture's book is obviously too big for "Mr. Big."

Fortunately, the other reviews are more reflective of the book and of Jesuit history.
