Stanislavski himself says, "My system is for those who have a creative nature. It's for the talented". On stage or on a movie set you have to be believable. All musicians should read this book (or any performing artist in that matter). It would be a priceless benefit for them... For instance, many soloists these days are displaying an unnatural, forced "phrasing". If they were asked to speak the way they play, the result would be so fake or even funny that they'd realize it in a flash.
