Ride a horse through China. Trek in Nepal. Ride on the back of a motorcycle from California to Northeast Canada.  These women are adventurous... yet are normal women with real fears.  After reading this book you'll have the courage to be more independent and challenge-seeking.  The stories range from the thrill-seekers (think African safari) to conservative travellers (such as going to Gatlinburg for a weekend with the girls)...but illustrates that stepping out of your comfort zone means different things to different women.  It's the effort that counts
