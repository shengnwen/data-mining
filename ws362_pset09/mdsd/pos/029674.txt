Roger Kahn's lyrical narrative is not a page turner.  Rather it slowly sucks you into the story with wonderful analogies, good charachter description and a  flat out good sports story to tell.

It is the story of a baseball dreamer who decides to explore the sport first had running a bankrupt team in habited by an interesting roster of charachters.  Whats great is that the author seems to know going in, that the business, money, and personell  side of baseball will be a rough ride that might tarnish his school boy image of the sport.  But he takes the plunge anyway _ almost as if saying I love this sport so much I want to see it all _ good bad and funny.

It has a happy ending too
