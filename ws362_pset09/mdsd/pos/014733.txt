We love the Rumpole books.  My husband and I have read all the Omnibus books.  We've never watched the series, so we have our own images of all the main characters:  Rumpole, The Bull, "She Who Must Be Obeyed."  Good stories...fun characters.  Good threading of plot and characters through all the stories.  Love it
