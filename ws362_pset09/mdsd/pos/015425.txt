I'll have to read this book several times more. However one only needs to  get to about page 5 to appreciate that the topic of space and measurement  is complex and encompasses far more than mastery of dividing kilometres,  litres, hours etc into handy sized bits. This book might help explain why  space and measurement gets a separate rating on your childs report and may  give you some hints on how to interest your child in the subject.It is, I  think, a common misconception that this part of Math is for those who will  do practical things in the &quot;real&quot; world. But where is the  &quot;real&quot; world? If something is so small that we are not able to  measure it can we be sure it exists at all
