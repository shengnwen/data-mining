  Morris meets a cow and a deer and tells them that they are a moose just like him. Of course the cow insists she is a cow, and now the deer tells Morris he is a deer.  Oh my! You have to keep reading to find out who wins this arguement.
  This is an adorable book and one that is easy for children to read or would be enjoyable to have read to them.  Cute illustrations are well.
