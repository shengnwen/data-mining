I found this book very helpful. It is clear and thorough and a very good resource for owners and trainers. It is also easily accessible, despite covering some fairly technical material. In terms of the content, Culture Clash is first rate. 

It suffers from problems in other areas, however. 

I agree with other reviewers who found this book to be distractingly disorganized. The chapters are loosely put together, and the lack of an index makes finding specific references difficult. My own copy has several post-it notes sticking out of it: a testament to the book's utility and lack of organization.

Another weakness of this book is Donaldson's tone, which is kind of cranky at times. She takes issue with other schools of thought in dog-training, and not only lets the reader know she disagrees with them, but also lets the reader know how stupid they are. The dog-training world is famous for rabid arguments, so I take her comments with a big salt-lick, but the book suffers from them.

This book would have greatly benefitted from a good editor. But still, the information it offers more than compensates for it's shortcomings. I have re-read sections of it many times, and still find it helpful.
