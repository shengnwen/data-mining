If you are going to read only one of Virginia Woolf's many works, this is the one to read.  She is the greatest novelist, but her novels cannot be equal, some being better or more universal than others.  She really *arrives* in this one.  I first read it twenty years ago in college, but I still think of phrases, thoughts, and concepts from this book.  The novel's themes resonate the way poetry does.  Worth the reputation.  I hope no one ever tries to make a movie out of this one
