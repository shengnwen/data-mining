I didn't grow up with formal religion, so in the past few years I have been introduced to Biblical Fiction by a few friends and family members.  Reading Biblical Fiction has been a great way for me to learn about these wonderful historical figures.

"Rachel and Leah" by Orson Scott Card was a great book that kept me up late at night reading.  It was enjoyable and informative.  I felt like I was back in biblical times, I could almost taste the dust on my lips.  However, I never felt like I got to know the characters.  I know the facts involving Rachel and Leah, but I'm reading fiction and I would have liked to have gotten to know them a little better, they weren't memorable to me.

The ending of "Rachel and Leah" was too abrupt for me.  I know Mr. Card is planning an additional book to follow "Rachel and Leah", which is very exciting, but I feel like he just didn't want to write anymore, so he ended the book.  Having said all that, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a little bit more information on biblical times and biblical figures
