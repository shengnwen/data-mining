I don't normally review children's books; however, this one is very special.  The art is superb and the main character, Olivia, is as humorous, lovable, artistic and curious.  She is quite precocious and even most adults will be charmed by her antics.  I laughed out loud at several parts and enjoyed reading the book myself.

If you are trying to instill artistic or creative aspirations in your children, this is probably a good book to own.  My understanding is that in subsequent books Olivia's personality is more controversial, but I haven't heard anyone complain about this one.  

The later books I have seen in this series have been different than the original including a personality shift in Olivia toward being more mischievous and perhaps even "over the top" with respect to some behaviors that parents may not want to encourage in growing children.  I suggest you read reviews of specific books before purchasing additional Olivia books if this is an area of concern.
