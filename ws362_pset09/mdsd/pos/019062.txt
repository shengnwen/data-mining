I enjoyed this book and Dershowitz's commentary. I agree with Dershowitz, about the 2000 election but also think that his argument could have been much shorter. Overall, however, it was a quick and informative read written easily for all of us that are not accustomed to legalise. Skim this book and get the main ideas, but don't spend too long - there are too many other good books out there
