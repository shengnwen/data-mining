This is a book on recreational mathematics. As such, the topics covered are diverse - from number theory to more practical matters such as probability. However, the common denominator is the author's clarity of expression - an essential quality for a book of this nature. Because of this diversity of topics, some may be of more interest to the reader than others. In my case, I particularly enjoyed the chapters on shared birthdays, Stirling's formula for factorials and Pad? approximants. Suggested problems are found throughout, with solutions at the end of each chapter. Written in a very friendly style, this book will surely appeal to math buff at all levels
