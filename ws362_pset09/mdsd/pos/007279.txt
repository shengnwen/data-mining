I've read many of Grisham's novels, and this remains my favourite.  It addresses complex issues and does not attempt to gloss them over.  I recommend this novel to those more familiar with Grisham's more recent work: this is what he is capable of, and it is outstanding.
Whether or not the end is 'right', it is satisfying
