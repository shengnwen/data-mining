  I am  a sixth grader.   If you like fantasy and adventure, then Doctor Dolittle is the book for you.  Doctor Dolittle was a people doctor in Puddleby-on-the-Marsh.  He was also an animal lover.  His house was full of all different types of animals.  The more animals he took in, the less people came for his help.  Because he liked animals better, he decided to care for animals instead.  His parrot, Polynesia, explained how animals have their own language.  After spending a lot of time with Polynesia, Doctor Dolittle soon learned the languages of all the different animals.  
     Chee-Chee the monkey told the doctor about an illness among the monkeys in Africa.  Doctor Dolittle said he would go there and care for the monkeys.  There was one problem.  He had no money to get there.  Some of the animals and Doctor Dolittle boarded a boat for the long trip to Africa.  It took them six weeks to sail there. The king didn't want them on his land so he put them all in prison.  They escape from the prison.  They finally find all the sick monkeys.  Doctor Dolittle starts tending to them.  You have to read the book to find out how this adventure ends.
     Another fun part in the book is when he finds an amazing animal.  It is like nothing you have ever seen before.  I will not tell what is special about it because I don't want to ruin the surprise. He takes this animal around so everyone can enjoy this unusual creature.
     Doctor Dolittle does eventually return home.  There are many other adventures and surprises in the book.  I don't want to ruin the book so you will just have to read it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, fantasy and make believe.  I wish I had the ability to talk to animals, don't you?  So hurry out and get this book.  You will be glad you did!!!!!!!
