A wonderful book. This is not a toddlers story book, with 3 letter words that rhyme and bright colored pictures to make up what the story lacks. This is a childrens book (8,9,10,11) to help them understand why they may choose to be vegetarian.
Like many wonderful classic books it is full of charming, black and white art. The book touches on animals feelings and enviromental issues on why someone may choose to be vegetarian. Good not only for vegetarian kids but also for other kids to get an understanding/acceptance of others
