&quot;Juran's Quality Handbook&quot; is a massive tome of great value to quality professionals. It is not smooth reading, nor is it the type of book that can be read quickly. Indeed, to maximize the usefulness of this &quot;Bible,&quot; I suggest reading one or two sections per month and try to apply the concepts as much as possible. It will improve one's effectiveness as a quality professional. The book covers every facet of quality I could imagine, so there certainly is no lack of material. I give it 4 stars due to an abundance of long, run-on sentences. This complicates the book unnecessarily, making the reader review sentences twice in many cases
