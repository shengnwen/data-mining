your view on this book will track with your appetite for erudition, academia and intellectual challenge. the criticisms that this book is "ivory tower" & arrogant are right!
Having said that, I enjoy the challenge, entertainment and new ideas Bloom always brings to the table. Some of his more esoteric trappings -- such as the Kabbalah-based framework for the book -- I simply ignore. But I think his love of the classics and belief in deep reading as a source of humanity are thought-provoking and much needed.
if you love literature and are willing to work a little, this is great book to read slowly and savor
