This book was an excellent starter in thinking critically about statistics. It was used as a textbook for a short college seminar I took, and I feel it really added to the material we discussed. However, it is wordy at times, without having much depth. If you're just starting to think about statistics, I recommend this, but you won't find a ton of content here
