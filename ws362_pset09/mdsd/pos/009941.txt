There's not much that one can add to this list of great reviews.  That's what kind of book this is.  I found it remarkable how quickly the landscape changed in those 10 years regarding populations of Native Americans, buffalo, and beaver.  In the last few entries we begin to see some of the damage done upon the Native Americans i.e. small pox, alcohol, and lifestyle and it's very depressing.  Likewise, Osborne describes the plummet in buffalo populations and the approaching end of the fur quest as beaver populations dwindled and other furbearers were becoming more profitable.  These were a rugged bunch of men and this is perhaps the best look into their lives and into the changed and vanished West.
