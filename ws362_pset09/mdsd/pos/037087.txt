Excellent novel!  One wonders if, in fact, it is a novel; however, Feldhahn explains in postscripts the connections between fact and fiction.  A terrific commentary on higher education today and how far we have strayed from original purposes, all skillfully woven in an exciting fictional fabric so real one could think they were reading a documentary. Going to buy several for my Christian friends
