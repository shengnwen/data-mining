Perhaps the least acclaimed (and least read) of Hammett's five full-length novels, "The Dain Curse" is still loads of fun. Each of its three parts is a crime story unto itself, unveiling the convoluted pasts of a couple who die in the first act and of their oddly dull-witted daughter.

The always-unnamed Continental Op arrives on the scene to investigate the disappearance of eight imperfect diamonds from the home of Edgar Leggett, a soon-dead scientist who was trying to develop a method for tinting the jewels. This section is the most traditional of the three--a rather formulaic detective story where many of the whodunits seem to be solved by the end. 

But it's the unsolved (and incorrectly solved) aspects of the mystery that provide the fuel for the next two parts. After the Op moves on to another case, he is called back to protect the Leggetts' daughter, Gabrielle, who is holed up--and doped up--with a religious cult. The Op stays in the Temple of the Holy Grail and observes both its strangely lethargic inhabitants and the charmingly plastic husband-and-wife team who leads the cult; his odyssey is one of the more atmospheric and bizarre adventures in Hammett's oeuvre. These four chapters alone are worth the price of admission.

From there, the action moves to the beachfront town of Quesada, where Gabrielle and her new husband have secreted themselves to recover from the prior series of traumatic events. The twists and turns--and the climax--are satisfying indeed, but what's lacking throughout the novel becomes apparent at last: Hammett's bizarre ambiance and the plot surprises fail to compensate for cardboard characterizations that aren't quite believable. 

Nevertheless, "The Dain Curse" is a brisk page-turner, and fans of crime novels and of Hammett in particular are sure to enjoy the ride
