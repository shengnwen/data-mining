Okay, this is a humor book, written by a humor writer.  Don't look for deep understanding, exhaustive research, or politically correct statements, viewpoints, or stories.

With that caveat...

For many guys, this book hits closer to home than you might expect.  Barry uses the technique of exaggeration to bring attention to the world of the guy, which he argues (successfully) is not the same as the world of the man.  "Guyness" is not "manliness." It involves more genetic guy-wiring, multiple remote controls, free-flowing testosterone, and tools.

Guaranteed to bring a chuckle out of 95% of men, 90% of women, and 100% of guys, who will look at it as a "how-to" book.

And don't take any of Barry's "guyness" quotient tests unless you are guy enough to handle the results
