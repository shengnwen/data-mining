You don't have to have an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia to gain insight from this book. I started out reading "Eating in the Light of the Moon" to see how I could help someone else through her E.D., only to find that I myself am a "disordered" eater, that is, I eat for reasons other than hunger. I eat to comfort myself, to stuff down feelings I don't want to deal with. I recommend this book to every woman. You will grow spiritually, your soul will be nourished, and you will be affirmed in your woman-ness. You will also be more grace-giving to yourself and to other women and girls in your life. It's the kind of book you just can't put down and it's good to the last page
