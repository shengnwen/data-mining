I found the blend of Erik's adventures climbing the Seven Summits and Paul's strong message perfect. I liked being able to relate back to real-life situations through Erik's writing. If there is anyone that turn the impossible in to possible, it is Erik Weihenmayer. So many books of this type lack the true human aspect of dealing with adversity in our lives. I became more focused, more creative, more driven, after reading Adversity Advantage. There is a life-changing message in this book. I highly recommend it
