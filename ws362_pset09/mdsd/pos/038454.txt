One of the biggest stumbling blocks when we set out to make our dreams come true is appreciating what is going well. Most of us have an unfortunate tendency to dwell on problems rather than the good things in our lives... and then we wonder why things just seem to keep getting worse instead of better. 

Therapists Noelle Nelson and Jeannine LeMare Calaba explain how you can achieve success in every area of your life through transforming your beliefs in THE POWER OF APPRECIATION. Whereas criticism, contempt, defensiveness and stonewalling work to destroy relationships, appreciation can help people feel like they're living in heaven on earth. Nelson and Calaba outline a practical five-step process to make your dreams come true that has proven effective for them with their clients. They also include scientific research and descriptions of individual case histories to help bring their ideas to life, so you can better understand how to harness the power of appreciation in your life. The five steps are: choosing what you desire, determining the feelings behind your desire, weeding out conflicting thoughts and beliefs, launching your vibration of appreciation, and working your appreciation. 

THE POWER OF APPRECIATION really hits its stride when it examines how appreciation can transform the relationships in our lives. Every relationship at work, at home, and with friends can prosper when one applies its five-step process for developing an appreciative mindset. I highly recommend this book for anyone genuinely interested in creating a better life
