The Publisher's Weekly review said this is too difficult for children. But back when it was first in bookstores, my 6-year-old daughter told me there was a very good book we should look at. She took my hand and led me to Old Turtle in a bookstore, where she had discovered it herself. We bought it promptly. Kids need everyday books like how Tommy first tied his shoe, but until pre-teen brain damage sets in, we need to give them more credit for the higher concepts they can understand. For us, it was the story that touched us so deeply. The illustrations were just a lovely and interesting bonus
