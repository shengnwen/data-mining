Most modern fantasy is formulaic junk. I renew my call for a complete ban on multi-volume epics in which the young hero (occasionally, heroine) must overcome terrific odds to save the world, win the girl (guy) and rule in peace forever. Or at least until the next multi-volume epic...  That mine is depleted of ore; that well is long since dry. It is time for something different.

Which is why I like McMullen. He writes serious fantasy that doesn't take itself too seriously. McMullen addresses serious themes - world-threatening weapons, for example - without losing his sense of the absurd. It makes "Glass Dragons" a refreshingly different and delightful read.

A cadre of sorcerors is re-building a fearsome, ancient weapon, the Dragonwall, which makes a sorceror a minor god. At least its gives the sorcerors who create it fearsome powers of destruction. Against this terrifying weapon are pitted some of the same characters we met in "Voyage of the Shadowmoon." Laron, the 700-year old vampyre in at 14-year old body; Terikel, the guilt-ridden last priestess of the Metrologan sect; Wensomer, the self-indulgent master sorceress. And delightful new characters, including the wonderful Andry Tennoner, lately of the bargeyard slums but now an aspiring gentleman. Andry is a masterpiece of a character, whose every action gently mocks the traditional luck child and epic hero, without ever being so crass as to come out and say as much.

I am baffled by McMullen's only limited success in the United States. He is a fine writer, and every one of his novels improves on the last. If you are looking for a break from fantasy-by-the-numbers, if you don't believe fantasy has to be solemn, you will enjoy the Moonworld series and "Dragonwall." Strongly recommended
