I knew nothing of this book until seeing it on a list of the best novels of the 20th century.  Now, I must agree that A Bend in the River is a fabulous novel.

Though no specifics are named, A Bend in the River takes place almost certainly in Zaire, where the President ("the Big Man") has put down the rebellion and restored order to the country.  Business flourishes, and many rejoice in the promise of the future.  Eventually, however, things take a turn for the worse.  The political climate becomes more repressive, government corruption and poverty abound, and the place becomes a real mess.

The reader experiences this through the eyes of Salim, an Arab-African (more African than Arab) storeowner in the local city.  Salim is a fascinating narrator - his observations can be brilliant and insightful, yet his detachment from the real world is quite striking.  Salim's ability to conceal his emotions from both the reader and himself is also of particular interest.

Readers should not expect an "action" novel - A Bend in the River falls much more along the style of E.M. Forster or Joseph Conrad - but Naipaul's prose is superb.  Feast your eyes on the opening sentence: "The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it." 

I understand why this book is so highly regarded.  I have never read a better personal account of the rise and fall of a dictatorial regime, fiction or otherwise.  Naipaul's work makes fantastic modern fiction.
