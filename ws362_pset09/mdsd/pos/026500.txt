     Like THE SECOND SEX and THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE, Joan Gould's SPINNING STRAW INTO GOLD is less a book than an awakening. Half scholarly work, half exquisite prose, this work is profoundly moving, one of those books that illuminates a woman's life. Most girls love fairy tales, whether they are from mythology ("Demeter and Persephone") or Hollywood("Pretty Woman"). In a fascinating book that is destined to become a classic, Ms. Gould tells us why we are drawn to one fairy tale over another. Insightful, warm, beautifully written, this book is a treasure. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
