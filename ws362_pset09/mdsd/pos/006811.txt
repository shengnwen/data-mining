Jones is one of the top fiction writers in america today and a master of the short story.

for this reader, this book continued to shine with Jones' typical intensity when dealing with Vietnam Vets and boxers. However, I felt the teacher story as well as the story about the 40-year-old living at home lacked the prose cadence & intensity and just didn't grab me the way his other, admittedly more cinematic stories
