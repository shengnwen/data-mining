I thought this was one of the most intelligent and honest books about the Korean American experience I have ever read. Other books, with memoir style perspectives, have explored the generational conflict and cultural and geographic displacement a Korean American may feel, but Lee does not seem comfortable speaking in the existing dialogue about immigrant experience, but instead includes that particular voice as a part of his inner dialogue--this discomfort is why the use of the espionage genre works so well. 

This book is about a man who in the end does not seem to exist, but not in the "quiet Asian man" way we typically hear about in Asian American discussion; also, the main character's subversive behavior is not a reaction to feelings of frustration stemming from marginalization. 

The man does not exist because he cannot face his other faces. 

As a character whose occupation is to act as a spy, he finds his job natural, but also problematic. The problem is that he does not feel strongly connected to any one identity; at least, not one with a face--he crosses from hating his father as a symbol of all that is old and prideful to admiring an up and coming Korean American politician as a symbol of a "Korean Man" he would like to meet, or perhaps, become. The problem reaches its climax when both men merge and are in the end, elusive to their supposed symbols. 

Native Speaker struck me as honest because it came out and said what it had to say: I cannot relate to any discussion about Korean American identity, because I believe the search for identity in these terms is futile. 

I do not walk by Lee's side on this point, but I believe he's on to something, and also, that he is brave for expressing it so passionately
