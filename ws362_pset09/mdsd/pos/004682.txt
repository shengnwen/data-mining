By far, this is the best book available... I bought most of the other books that also were highly recommended - but this one blows them out of the water.  I'm 10 weeks pregnant and this is the book I turn to first.  It has week by week pictures and is so well organized you can flip to any chapter or symptom.  I've used it so much the pages and margins are creased!
