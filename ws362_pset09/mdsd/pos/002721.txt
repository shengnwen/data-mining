Another excellent tome in the &quot;Essential&quot; collection, this one covers the &quot;mid&quot; years of the Lee/Kirby run, between the outstanding inventiveness of the earliest material and the legendary run in  the #40-#60 range that introduced Galactus, the Inhumans, etc. So what's  the highlight here? Well, #20-#40 pretty much are reprinted, and even in  black and white they mostly shine - the best stories include the origin of  Dr. Doom, a slam-bang battle between the FF, the Hulk and the Avengers, an  awesome confrontation between a powerless FF and Doom, and the introduction  of the Frightful Four! Woo! Great stuff! I'm only knocking this down one  star because of the hideous inking Kirby's pencils got on the first five or  so issues included in this collection - it's slapdash and sketchy, awful  stuff compared to Chic Stone's great inking in the last 2/3 or so of this  mammoth book.
