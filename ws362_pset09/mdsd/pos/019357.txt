This is a high recommend. I only read it because there's been so much talk about it in my circle, and it far surpassed my expectations.  As someone who has struggled with my weight, it has not been easy for me to think about starting a new diet plan. My weight is a sensitive issue for me, and I have struggled with it multiple times in the past.  The book's plan is simple and doesn't require you go out and buy a lot of products or anything.  It seems like the book is written because the author generally cares about helping people not only lose weight but improve their health
