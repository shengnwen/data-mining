I enjoyed the book, it was very helpful to me. I have read 2 other of the authors books, and I agree with the other reviews that some of the book was recycled. But a lot of it was researched about how the holiday began, and alternatives to some of the traditions we have and why we have them. I agree that sending Christmas cards is bad for the eviroment and we could save a lot of trees, and money in stamps. Also why are we not using recycled wrapping paper, and why are we bothering to wrap gifts at all? Why not use news paper for kids if you have to wrap gifts?  she has an entire section on Christmas for kids. I think this is a good book, and worth reading if you want to simplify your holiday. I love the portion on non traditonal Christmas and celebrating as other cultures do. Less focus on gifts and more focus on what we truly care about
