Pre-Requiste: Read Gershom Scholem's 'Kabbalah' first. If you survived that book you MAYBE ready for 'On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah.' 

This book is much more challenging than 'Kabbalah' (is that possible?). In fact it's possibly the most difficult book I've ever read. Where 'Kabbalah' covers a lot of history and kabbalistic basics, this volume deals primarily with the most abstract concepts so be forewarned. A very difficult read, so make sure you're willing to put in the time and effort. If you do, you'll be among the knowledgeable.
