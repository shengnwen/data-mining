Magical thinking can be defined as believing that one's own thoughts can influence events, either beneficially, by creating good luck, or for the worse, like giving someone the "evil eye." In Burroughs' book, one of his chapters/essays discusses his thoughts on "magical thinking," but the majority of his essays are just humorous factoids of life. Who'd have thought that even the most mundane thing or episode in a person's life could be that funny? It gives the rest of us hope that we can look upon our own lives and laugh. 

Actually, his stories and life events (if they can really be called "events") remind me of emails exchanged between friends and me. Something so ridiculous or inane might happen in one of our lives and trigger an email. It may come across as venting at first, but it becomes a very humorous escapade (that may have not seemed funny at the time). 

Sadly, this is my first book that I've read of Augusten's, although I have a collection at home. I'm thrilled that I've finally started...and the good news is that now I really want to jump right into the rest, knowing what a pleasure it is to read his musings, laugh at his miseries, and feel connected to someone who has an eye for finding the humor in even the worst situation. 

I caution those who don't appreciate sarcasm, though. Burroughs is VERY sarcastic...and blunt. For me, that's a plus. For others, it may be offensive. It's good just to take everything with a grain of salt...and wash it down with a tasty margarita. :
