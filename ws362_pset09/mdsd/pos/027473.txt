This is a very thorough, convincing book.  If there is an aspect of nonbelief that Dan Barker didn't cover, I haven't thought of it yet, either.  At first I was a little put off by the use of previously published articles because it seemed to deliver some redundance.  Soon I was enjoying the format; the articles are each delicious.  So instead of trying to read it straight through as I originally planned, I took a couple of weeks to read it, a couple of chapters at a time, and I enjoyed the book immensely.  It is easy to read, with almost a conversational style.  

I read a criticism that this book didn't concentrate enough on the author's process in eschewing religion.  I don't believe that complaint is warranted.  Personally, my doubts grew, and grew, until I reached the day when I realized that it would never make sense to me, that it couldn't make sense to me.  I realized that I couldn't live my life guided by an ancient text, that I didn't believe in heaven or hell, and that all non-Christians could not be doomed.  I started breaking off the pieces that I couldn't swallow, until nothing was left.  Barker calls this a deconversion.  He says he went to throw out the bathwater, and found there was no baby.  

The tone of this book at times seems almost evangelical about atheism.  But in our political world, I believe that someone needs to be speaking for those of us who aren't mainstream "Christians."  Keep writing your essays, Dan Barker.  I appreciate your voice.
