If only Amazon allowed us to review in half-stars.  Frustration!

Coben's first stand-alone is still his best.  I was so taken with this novel that it, along with Darkness, Take My Hand by Lehane and Cujo by King, created within me the irresistible urge to write genre fiction.  The writing is crisp and at its most descriptive here than in any of his other books, the Bolitar series included.  His characters are believable, albeit still overly quirky.  For some reason Coben thinks a character can only be interesting if he crams them full of colorful idiosyncracies.  Fans of Myron Bolitar know this tendency of Coben's to be true.  Their eccentricities occasionally detract from the story, but the strength of the plot and the twists and turns provide the impetus to forge ahead.  

And you're not disappointed.  The twists come at a relentless clip (only Deaver can compare in the twist department), and as the pace picks up you gain the sensation of free-falling, as if Beck's life has gotten so out of control that there's no way he can right it again.  Yet at the end it all comes together, and credibly at that.  You're left with one heck of a ride, catching your breath and wanting to read the next stand-alone.  A four and a half stars guaranteed thrill
