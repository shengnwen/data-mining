I saw Dorothy Leeds at a book talk and was so impressed that I had to buy her book.  I am very impressed at the breadth of occupations and life situations to which her writing applies.  It is very practical information that almost anyone can use.  I am in the field of education, and it will certainly help me to ask better questions as a teacher.  You won't be disappointed
