This is a special book about private revelations of Jesus Christ to Sr. Faustina.  The book offers special insights into her life, and a great amount of detail on the miracles.  I took the advice from the reviewer from Baltimore to read this first before reading the diary.  It is wonderful to read about these amazing events from only about 60 years ago
