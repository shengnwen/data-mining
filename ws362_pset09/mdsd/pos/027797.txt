 This book ,written by an obscure U.S. Navy officer, is credited with opening the eyes of many emerging countries to the need for seapower. It lit off the first arms races that almost bankrupted countries building "dreadnoughts" (early Battleships) and lead to the rise of both Japan ,Germany and the U.S. as serious Naval powers actively seeking colonies.

 This book ignited the fuse that lead to the battle of Jutland and to Pearl Harbor.

 History buffs,Naval  officers and students getting ready for their first year at Annapolis should check it out
