I admit, if you are a brainwashed La Leche fanatic or one of those moms who gives up her entire identity (and marital bed!) to motherhood, no, you probably don't like this book. However, if you are a normal person who wants a lot of honest, practical advice, this book is both entertaining and informative. She doesn't advocate IGNORING your baby's needs...she advocates remembering that MOMS have needs too!! And, frankly, anyone who has seen a one-year-old cry and then stop to see if you're watching knows that babies indeed can be "manipulative." Perhaps that is too harsh a term, but I have the sense that the people who vehemently criticize this book are the same people who still share their beds with a four-year-old who asks, "Mom, could you lift your shirt so I can have a snack?
