"That is why he is a Warrior of the Light, because he has been through all this and yet has never lost hope of being better than he is." -from the book.

I love how this book shows the good and bad of our human nature and blesses it all. We all have within us the light and the dark. Which one will we allow to guide us? We are whole because of both. 

This book is encouraging and truthful, and full of wisdom. As you read this, you will take a look inside yourself and acknowledge what is there. This is a good book to keep out where you can pick it up and read something from it often. It's great to keep by your bedside for light reading before bed, or in the morning when you get up.

"In order to have faith in his own path, he does not need to prove that someone else's path is wrong." -one of my favorite passages from the book.

I enjoy this book. I hope you'll read it too!
