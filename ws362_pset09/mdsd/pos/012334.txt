Chieng's novel is a family saga, but it is no thousand page tome.  Through short, funny vignettes than span decades, the reader comes to know the Cantonese Lums of Orange County, CA.  In this short book, the reader gets to know three decades of the Lum family in surprising detail.

Chieng's timeline jumps around.  It opens with Louis, the protagonist, adrift and barely thriving in his post-college job as a magazine fact checker.  He is forced to move in with his gansta-rap loving dad, Sonny, to keep Sonny from trying to kill the man who accidentally killed his wife in a car accident.  When Chieng fills in the backstory of Sonny's boyhood, Sonny's marriage to Louis's mom Mirla, uncle Bo's relationship with Grandma Esther, and the relationship between Granpa Melvin and Esther, the story truly comes alive.  The family is unintentionally hilarious on all levels, from Louis's attempts to speak Cantonese with the correct inflection, to Sonny's love of rap, to Grandma Esther's famously dreadful turnip cakes.

This book comes highly recommended along with the other Breakout Books of 2005
