The title is a little decieving.  This book doesn't really profile silat or kuntao.  Rather, it is one of the best books on concepts that I've ever read.  I'd place it up there with &quot;Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot;.  The concepts of gyroscopic rotation, shearing, adhesion, etc. can be applied to any art, given a little imagination.  While the reader will learn something on the history of Indonesian martial arts, it is really the underlying principle that recieve the most attention.  One won't really learn HOW to do silat or kuntao, but will gain an understanding of WHY the practitioners of such arts do the things they do.  There is nothing on weapons, which I thought was strange, and nothing on Kali, which I thought was Indonesian, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is one of the best books on martial arts principles out there.  No matter whether one is looking for asthetics, self-defence, understanding the &quot;arts&quot;, or sporting aspects of martial arts, there is something in this book for everyone.  I'd recomend it to anyone serious about the martial arts, but those with a more casual attitude towards the arts may not find anything useful here.  If I could only have five martial arts books, this would be one of them
