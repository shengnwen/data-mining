I've done some investigating on this book and James Frey as an author. When he first started looking for a publisher to publish A Million Little Pieces, we titled it as a non-fiction work, and was turned down for years. He finally put the title of Biography on his book and it immediately was picked up by a publisher.

All that aside whether he was right or wrong..the book is very well written. One of the best books I have read in a while. Frey is an amazing sensory writer and really lets the reader imagine the scenarios described. You can't help but feel sad for James at his lows and rejoice with him at his highs.

Overall..I would recommend this book to anyone with enough time, and the stomach for some graphic stuff :
