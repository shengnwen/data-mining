I have spent almost a year studying Japanese, primarily with the Pimsleur tapes, but also with grammar books and a few private lessons with a native speaker.  With that background I find this book very useful.  It helps me review what I already know; it supplements my vocabulary; and it makes clear some grammatical issues that Pimsleur leaves murky.  Pimsleur gets you speaking, but makes no comprehensive effort to teach grammar.

Having said that, I do not think I would find this book useful if I were a total beginner.  I cannot agree with the reviewer who called it "garbage."  It is more accurate to say that beginners should look elsewhere, but that the book is useful for students who have already struggled with Japanese for a while, as I have.

I recommend the kana version of the book.  Anyone who has enought knowledge of Japanese to profit from this book will also profit from the opportunity to read Japanese in kana characters.
