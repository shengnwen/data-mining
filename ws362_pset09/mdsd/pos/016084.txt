Before reading this, I fancied myself as someone who might get into travel writing to make a few thousand extra dollars a year. After reading this book, I said, "That's WAY too much work for the money" and the realization was, quite accurately I think, that travel writing is a PROFESSION. Professions take full time attention to be successful and a lot of time (years really) to build up the knowledge, contacts, and writing style to make a living. I'm just not willing to put in the 40 hrs per week on it.

The book is very prescriptive, giving detailed instructions on what to do "x" many months before departure, who to contact, where to find them, what to say, how to say it, how many pictures of what kind to take and send, how to do your background research etc. I created project management spreadsheets (because I am a dork) based on the recipe in the book. When I got done I realized how incredibly much work it required. I do not doubt at all that if you followed this prescription you would be a successful travel writer, but it's not something you can dabble in and do well unless you have unusually remarkable connections.

If you have already dedicated your heart to being a travel writer, ABSOLUTELY buy this book and follow the advice. If you were looking to dabble, like I was, you may want to pass.

Not because the book isn't well written; its style is accessible, very helpful and made me really excited about traveling and writing again. As a compromise, I just started a travel blog. No money in it, but no pressure or research required either so I can focus on enjoying the writing part
