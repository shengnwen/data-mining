Fans of retold fairy tales, such as those by Angela Carter and Tanith Lee, should order this book immediately.  It's marketed as a children's book; whether it's entirely appropriate for that age level, parents will have to decide for themselves, but I can definitely say from one adult to another that this book isn't just for children.  It's the Hansel and Gretel story from the witch's point of view.  The story of how she came to be a witch is moving and satisfying.  Ironically, I had just previously read Max Luthi's EUROPEAN FOLKTALE, which argues that part of the power of fairy tales is the one-dimensionality of the characters.  Napoli adds dimensions to the witch, and it only enriches the character and the story.
