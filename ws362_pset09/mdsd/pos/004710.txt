Jeff Toobin is an engaging writer who draws you into his narrative and makes you want to turn pages. His book is chatty and "dishes" about all the internecine fighting between lawyers both on the prosecution and defense sides.

As an O.J. trial junkie, I have read many books on the subject, and Toobin's certainly falls into the "he was guilty" school of thought. Toobin doesn't really hide his bias, but that doesn't detract much from his examination of why O.J. was acquitted.

I recommend the book to anyone who has an interest in the "trial of the century", but "The Run Of His Life" probably shouldn't be the only book you read on the subject. For the definitive account of the trial, read "American Tragedy" by Schiller.

As for whether O.J. did it or not, I tend towards the guilty opinion myself. I do have one nagging question, however: how did he dispose of the knife and clothes so that they were never recovered, yet took one glove back with him and dropped it on his lawn? The theory that he left both gloves at the scene (a smart thing to do) and then someone took one and "planted" it on his property has at least some measure of plausibility. I can't imagine O.J. being so savvy and stupid at the same time
