This is an excellent reference book to knitting. It uses 20 words where 6 might do better and is boring to read. But it has information that you will not find in any other knitting book.

Other flaws besides the excess verbosity are her opinions on  ideal hold of needles and yarn, and the curious non-organization, and her flip dismissal of grafting using stitch holders or multiple needles.

Her favorite needle hold is awkward and slow. Her dismissal of the Continental hold is not rational. Some of the best knitters in the world use this hold. She does not mention the extremely fast Greek/Turkish/Macedonian/Peruvian hold using the thumb to flip the yarn, and tensioning around the neck  at all. This is not a curiosity, but an extremely fast method of knitting deserving a spot in such a comprehensive book of words, words and more useless words. 

The organization of the book is strange, but a good index makes up for it. Casting on which is the first thing you do is in Chapter 6, after you have read 120 some pages and five chapters about many complex knitting stich concepts.

The information on designing, charting and correcting patterns is the best I have seen anywhere.

I consider the classic Righetti and Zimmerman books useless, so I am not easily impressed by "sainted" knitting references.

It should be edited way down, reorganized, and reissued. It is definitely not worth over $300 in its current form weighing about 5 to 7 lbs. It was worth the $40, its original price
