When I started this book I found his humor inappropriate for the topic, more because the jokes seemed corny than any dislike of black humor. He writes of wartime, and jokes about past encounters with girls or his smoking habits lessen the gravity of the message. Still, he has the heart and eye and interest, that made the book a good read, and his commentary evolved as the book progressed to true satire. If he cut out eighty percent of the jokes, the ones remaining would have seemed much more funny, and the seriousness underneath would have been more effective
