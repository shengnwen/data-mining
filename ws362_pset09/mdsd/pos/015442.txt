If you ever felt that you wanted to be "somebody else," if you ever felt that you "were not good enough," this book explains where these feelings and thoughts might have come from. It does not go into great detail as to what you can do about it, but it is very insightful and serves as a proverbial wake-up call to "perfectionists" all over. He sorta argues that we are all on this quest to be 'perfect,' but this quest is destined to failure before it even begins. Read this book to gain insight and move forward on the journey. Also, read "There is Nothing Wrong with You" by Cheri Huber to really give yourself a "1-2" knockout of wisdom.
