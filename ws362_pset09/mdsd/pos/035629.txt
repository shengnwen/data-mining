I just finished re-reading The Gunslinger. I must confess that when I read it for the first time I was not impressed. I have decided to re-read it after I have read the first 4 books and Surprise! Surprise! it was much more interesting. I think the reason behind it is that I have got to know Roland better from the book 4 - Wizard and Glass (about his past). It helped to understand The Gunslinger. In the introduction and foreword of this new edition S. King mentions The Lord of the Rings a few times and that he wanted to write as great book or better. To tell truth, while reading the following books, I felt an influence of Tolkien, which is a positive sign. 
This edition is very well made. It has a beautiful dust jacket and many "odd" pictures inside. They are trying to convey some of the ideas of the book but sometimes they are so obscure it is hard to understand what the artist wanted to tell us.
All in all, in my opinion The Gunslinger is a great book and a good start for great story.
