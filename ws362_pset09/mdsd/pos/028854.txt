When a Continental Detective Agency operative is called in by an insurance company to investigate the theft of eight loose diamonds, he quickly realizes that there is more to this case than meets the eye. Something very strange is going on, and murder after murder seems to be swirling around young Gabrielle Leggett. Is there really a curse attached to her blood, a curse upon all of the Dains? It just might be true!

I love detective stories, and read them all the time. But, Dashiell Hammett is not your everyday mystery writer; he's the originator of the hardboiled detective story. This book was first published in 1929, and it is a great read. I love the characters, and the way that they interact. But, even better is the dialogue, including the quote above!

Overall, I think that this is a great story. If you like tough, two-fisted crime fiction, then this is the book for you. It's a great book by the king of his genre!
