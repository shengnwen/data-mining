This is an excellent book for an empirical overview of how humanity treats itself during the time when it is most inhumane.  The only complaint I have with the book is its concentration on the Soviet Union and communism.  Because Best wrote the book during the Cold War, this is understandable, but it still needs an update.  Otherwise, excellent read
