I learned only two major things about Mr. Popper from reading this book.  First, he's a painter, and second, he really, really likes the polar regions of the world.  Earlier today, when I saw a guy painting a bathroom, I almost felt like asking him if he ever dreams about visiting penguins in Antarctica.  I tell you, after reading Mr. Popper's Penguins, I'll never look at painters in the same way ever again.  Maybe they're all like that.

The plot's super-simple and the only part that's even remotely complex is when Mr. Popper is thrown in jail.  Such things happen...

There's a particular scene in the chapter "More Troubles" where Mr. Popper tries to call and ask about getting a penguin license.  He has some problems being understood over the telephone, and I thought the horribly persistent miscommunications were delightfully funny.  

I would recommend this book to any kid.  It may be a bit simple for adults but there's no denying that it's good, clean fun.  It possesses a rare trait in that it's truly appropriate for anyone and it doesn't try to push any agenda.  You'd have to be a real stick-in-the-mud to hate or feel threatened by any part of Mr. Popper's Penguins.  A perfect kid's book
