I bought it to have handy for rainy days. My children were small and I needed something to keep them entertained. After many years of using it and planty of fun, I moved and I lost it. I am buying again, because I treasure it. And when my children come back with their children, this is the book they want to see. Sincerely, Hilder Garriso
