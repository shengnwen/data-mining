This is a great book for anyone learning how to handle dogs.  It gives you great pictures of how you are supposed to stack dogs. Other books tell you how to do it, but lack pictures.  This also uses a variety of breeds in their pictures.  It goes over stacking on the ground vs. stacking on the table.  It also does a good job explaining the dog show world, which can be confusing for newcomers.  I highly recommend this book...even more than George Alston's book (another great one!)
