Jack London's social document written in 1902 about the slum of London's East End paints no less than hell, `a huge killing machine': an illiterate scrambling mass of human beings living in the most squalid conditions, inhaling air saturated with sulfuric acid. 
The fact, that there were `more people than houses', was fully exploited by house-sweaters.
The fact that there were `more men than work' was ruthlessly used by employers to pay starvation wages. Moreover the working conditions were abominable; every year 1 out of 1400 workers were killed, 1 out of 2500 were totally and 1 out of 9 temporary disabled.
55 % of the children died before the age of 5. The average lifetime was 30 years.
The renowned economist Pigou estimated that 71 % of the population of London lived on the brink of starvation.

In the innermost centre of Christian civilization, in the heart of the wealthiest and most powerful empire in the world, cynical moral indecency was the standard. The church goers remained callous before the permanent hunger wail and the slaughter of the innocents: `It's their own fault'. More, the `soul snatchers' promised paradise after life.

The situation in London reflected the global situation in England, which was perhaps worse, because people continued to migrate in the city.

If Jack London's book is a dramatic plea for more humanity on behalf of the powerful, his solution (`better management') is more than naive. What the starving poor (the vast majority of the population) needed was democracy (one man, one vote) in order to grab power themselves.

This book is unfortunately still topical, because, in a certain sense, the social contrasts inside London at the beginning of the 20th century reflect our North/South division.

Not to be missed.
