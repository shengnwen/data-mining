In order to describe Postmodernism, one has to first explain what Modernism was -- since Postmodernism is something that comes after Modernism.  In fact, until I read this book, I was not sure about what Modernism was, let alone what Postmodernism was.  The author of this book does a superb job elucidating the entangled relationship between Modernism and Postmodernism, and their relationship to Christian faith.  As the author points out, there is no one singular definition of Postmodernism, since it is a phenomenon that envelops art, literature, music as well as philosophy. I think Postmodernism is something that you FEEL, rather than THINK.  So it is terribly difficult to describe what it is, let alone explain its relationship to Christianity. Nevertheless it is a task somebody has to accomplish in order to equip Christian apologetics in this Postmodern era.  But I had one question as I was reading this book: if Postmodernism can be defined, for the sake of simplicity, as "Any Way You Make It," and it can aid our Christian faith, does it mean that the Christian truth is also any way you make it?  I think not.  We believe in absolute truth, and it is written in the Bible and capsulated in the person of Jesus Christ.  It is not negotiable and not open to any twists and turns of human interprepation.  However, I agree with the author that, in so far as Postmodernism destroys the tower of skepticism that Modernists had set up so high, Postmodernism can help our Christian faith and advocacy
