  Alan Furst has written other novels of the dark days in Eastern Europe as war approached. In "The World At Night," his subject is France just before its cowardly "defense" against German invasion and the immediate aftermath of France's surrender.

  Furst is, as always, a master at depicting the oppressiveness of German occupation. Private cars are requisitioned. Radios must be turned into the authorities or their owners face imprisonment or far worse. The simplest things of life are rationed or unavailable. And always the German occupier and its French collaborators are at hand, threatening.

  For a while Parisians try to get on with their lives. Jean-Claude Casson, a producer of B-movies, continues to move on with his lovers, his falling out with his true love Citrine, an ex-wife and her husband and their circle of partying friends.

  Bit by bit, some in the circle fall into the orbit of the Germans, profiting handsomely while the French police and their German masters root out Jews and other enemies of the New France.

  Casson tries to fight back by becoming involved with British Intelligence --- and a dangerous double-game with the German SD security service.

  The plot is thinner than other Furst novels. Still excellent, but it lacks the feeling of oppressiveness and ever-present danger that I've felt in his other work. Casson is, to a certain extent, something of a lightweight and almost extraneous to the story of Paris under German occupation.

  Overall, that porrait --- a people who weren't prepared or willing to defend their freedom --- and living with the consequence of such cowardice is the real story here. Furst never fails at painting the dread a subject population must feel every day. But Casson neve quite makes it as a sympathetic or particularly heroic character. He is just sort of an "everyman" caught up in a swirl of events much larger than himseelf. Not unusual in a Furst novel, but not as well-defined either.
