HIDDEN RICHES is a tale about an antique dealer (Dora Conroy) who buys some items for her shop at an auction and becomes the target of an international criminal. Enter Jed Skimmerhorn (where did she get that name?) who is an ex-cop and new neighbor of Dora's. His attraction to her causes him to jump back into the crime game to protect Dora at all costs. They have to figure out why she is the target and they find out that treasures can be hidden almost anywhere. Of course they have to battle a mutual attraction along the way!

Ok, this theme has been done over and over again, but not was well as Nora Roberts does it! Once again she adds romance and mystery together for her own special blend of wonderful reading. She does it so well, that I've forgotten if she writes a better romance novel or mystery. She always has strong characters and interesting locations. She doesn't buy into the one weak and one strong character issue, but instead combines passion, strong wills, intelligence, etc. This is a much more realistic view of people in today's world.

I've read most of her books, and with the exception of a few Silhouette Romance novels in the beginning of her career, I haven't found any that I didn't like. I've especially enjoyed her latest (actually those from the last 5 or so years!) which combine the genres and create a fictional account that is her own extraordinary writing style and has something for every type of reader!
