I read this story in Greek Mythology in university.  Jason is some kind of wise man.  His father was a doctor.  The Argonauts are a band of wise men, doctors, shamans, augurers, omen-readers, and shape-changers.  The Argo is  a ship of dreams.  The name Jason has become very popular.  I often ask  fellows named Jason if they know where their own name comes from, and  usually they do not.  Everyone named Jason should read the Argonautica.   Anyone who knows a Jason should give him a copy for a gift
