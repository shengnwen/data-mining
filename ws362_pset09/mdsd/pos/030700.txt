I have read all of Mr. Cahill's books and consider this to be the finest. He answers and ambitious question -- "Did Jesus Matter?" By comparing the expectations of the civilized world before and after Jesus in a wonderfully entertaining fashion, he provides fresh insights and makes a compelling case. Whether you are a Christian or not, you can appreciate this captivating perspective and Mr. Cahill's lively writing.
