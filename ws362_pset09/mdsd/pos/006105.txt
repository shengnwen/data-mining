A beautifully written, well-crafted book with exciting characters and tantalizing plot.  The author really gets you to care what's happening and you join in the frustration and fear of the main players.  The audio version, particularly, brought the characters to life with accents and speech mannerisms that tantalized.

If there was a sequel on sale now, I'd stand in line to get it
