I think System Modeling should ship this book with their software (I don't know, just use Arena in school and never bought it yet). This book is self-explaination.  Tutorial is great.  Easy to walk-through or jump to  each chapter if you want to. If you are &quot;or&quot; will be using Arena,  get this book.  You won't regret it.  Don't forget to check another book of  Kelton.  That book will take you to more detail of what simulation is
