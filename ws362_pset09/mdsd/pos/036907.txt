This is an impressive manual that brings forward the harmonization of international statistical standards a great deal, while bringing in a link between transactions and balance sheets. 

Paragraph 471 is hard going and the section on "attribution of production" in Chapter IV lacks a foundation in institutional units. The importance of "other flows" as important economic events in their own right could be emphasized more. I am looking forward to the next edition
