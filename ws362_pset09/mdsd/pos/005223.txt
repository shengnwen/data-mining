Fans of "The History of the Future" take note! Whether you are a fan of Zack's "Something Awful" website or just like to read weird books about WW2 or failed engineering experiments, this is the book you're looking for. There are times when I actually laughed out loud reading this book, and not just during the narratives! Overall the narratives are exciting and the nuts and bolts segments are written in a pretty understandable style. 

I can't believe I tried to run him over with my submarine and stab him again and again! Sorry about that, Zack! My bad!
