I have used this book for the past year in my thermodynamics courses.  It is at times a bit confusing, especially when Sandler decides to change notation halfway through the book.  Charts and Data are extremely useful however there are some important compounds missing which meant that I had to resort to the web in order to find the data.  However this book does easily explain many concepts of thermodynamics.  I would recommend this book for thermodynamics courses at the bachelors level.
