I am following the proceedures outlined in this book. That was my New Years Resolution. Check back in a year and I'm sure you'll find that I have made mucho dinero in 2007. It will be my best year ever, and I will more than double my income (not that hard, considering the pitiful amount I made last year). 

I am trying to get other people to do this, too. But I won't wait for others to see the value of this. I believe that it will really help me, a knowledge worker, who has multiple projects, and millions of great ideas, but feels overwhelmed by trying to implement them all. This book is just what I needed, and for me to say it resonates with me is an understatement of the first, second, and third water.
