I got this book for my toddler. He was fascinated to see all sizes and shapes of the moon and relate them to the real moon. He now gets up saying "moon grew and grew". 

When I draw for him he wants me to draw the phases of the moon. He loves the part where the dad tries to climb up and up for the moon. He loves this book. 

But unfortunately , I think I should have delayed giving him this book. The page where the moon unfolds is very flimsy. My son wants to look at that page and there is no way the book is going to stand a toddler's grab! That is my only concern. I got the board book online thinking that I could give it to him to read for himself. He likes to do that. But this book has been a sad experience for him in that way as he can't have the book he really loves. 

Infact he can even handle hardcover or paperback books well. But the unfolding moon is very flimsy and doesnt fold back very well after a few reading sessions
