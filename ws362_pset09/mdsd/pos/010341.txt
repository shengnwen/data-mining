Life in the Son is a good critique of Eternal Security that doesn't contain much of the polemics that are so common in many books and articles (on both sides) on the issue of Eternal Security.  Shank explains the key verses that always become flashpoints in debates in an easy to understand manner.  There are a few problems with his book that I would like to point out.  For instance, he seems to concentrate more on contradictory Calvinist commentaries of the verses rather than explaining the verses themselves.  But all in all, its a pretty good book
