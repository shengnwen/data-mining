William Martin's With God on Our Side offers a sympathetic yet objective look at the evolution of Christian fundamentalism in America over the last 50 years, culminating in the rise of the Christian Coalition and the Religious Right.  Written in conjunction with a PBS series of the same  title, Martin's book contains both a detailed overview and plenty of  first-hand accounts of events that have transformed what was once a  politically non-existent group into one of the most important voting blocs  in America.  No matter which side of the fence you fall on, this book is a  must for students of both religion and politics
