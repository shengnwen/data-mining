sanford meisner on acting was recommended to me by my first meisner teacher five years ago. I had done a lot of local theatre before and wanted to improve my technique. This book not only enhanced my study of the technique but has become an often used,  well worn reference guide. The technique not only made me a better actor, but i have become a much more effective communicator in my "real" life. It is a wonderful thing to feel as if you are truly "present" and "in the moment" when you are onstage. Meisner teaches better than anyone else that "acting is reacting". A great read for anyone (not just actors) wanting to increase their communication skills
