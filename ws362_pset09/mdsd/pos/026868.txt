Very readable (I have no background in linguistics). Tackles a monster question (How did language come to be the way it is?) and provides an easy to absorb answer. I thought it would take me forever to read this book, I'm about to finish it after a couple of days. It's not easy to understand how much of the answer provided is the author's opinion and how much is accepted by the Klingon High Council for Linguistic Affairs but seeing how the KHC was wrong in the past, maybe that doesn't matter much. Highly recommended. Examples from an astonishing number of languages
