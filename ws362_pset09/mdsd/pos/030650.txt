When I first saw this book, I was hoping for a book that told what happened on flight 93 and the emotions of the people and family.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book had all and more I was looking for.  It takes the reader through a detailed account of every person on flight 93, what kind of person they were, and how they spent thier last minutes.  This truly is a motivational book and makes you step back and realize how precious our own lives are.  It made me appreciate more the people I see and love every day of my life.  It helps you to never take for granted your life
