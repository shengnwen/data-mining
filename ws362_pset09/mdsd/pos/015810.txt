Kipling did an excellent job in compliling and communicating these stories.  I thoroughly enjoyed each story, with the exception of the one about how writing was invented, which seemed a bit boring to me.
Kipling had me rolling with laughter with each of the stories, and most of the time his notes on his pictures were the funniest parts (well, this picture doesn't have anything to do with the story, but it does have an armadillo in it...).
This book is a true classic, and it is unfortunate that it seems to have fallen out of favor with our present culture.  Perhaps this has something to do with a few racist remarks in the book, or the swastika in some of his pictures (it was a part of Kipling's official logo long before the Nazi's took it).  In either case, these things need to be looked over as a product of their age, and they should not in the least dampen the fun to be had in reading this book
