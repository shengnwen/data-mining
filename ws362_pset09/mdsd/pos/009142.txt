I read this book six years ago when I was twelve.  It remains one of my most memorable books. It absolutely moved me to tears. I read the last page over and over, crying and sniffling, feeling depressed to the point where I thought I was gonna die from being depressed. But wow, I couldn't believe  it was a true story. I find that the most impactful movies and books on  historical characters, are those that move you to learn more about the real  life persons. This was one of those impactful books. Read it! You won't  regret
