I read the "trilogy" this summer, starting with, what I consider her best, Fifty Acres and a Poodle, followed by The Exact Same Moon. I did enjoy Growing Girls, although the chapters were erratic at times and did not exactly follow a timeline. It was more a collection of essays. I'm hoping she will write another book as I love hearing about her life as a mom and the rigors/joys of living on a farm. I was disappointed not to hear more about Marley the poodle in this book, but I know she has a different focus now that she has kids.
