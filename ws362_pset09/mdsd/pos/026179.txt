Thanks to Augustus Ceaser for not buring the Aeneid, not listening to Virgil's request before he died thinking that it wasn't finished.  Well Augustus Ceaser read and completely refused due to the well written story(epic) that Virgil has written. 

This story is well written, with many flashbacks going to back to the "Illiad" by Homer, in Book #2 and really shows how the "Trojan Horse" was used.  Many discredit this theory.  But I personally think there is a lost book of Homer the 3rd one where it is between the "Illiad" and "Odyssey"  Well Virgil, made that book since we have not found it.  Thanks to Virgil who fills in theories of what happen between the "Illiad" and "Odyssey"

This form of the Aeneid is well written and very well understood.  Overall Effect: 5/
