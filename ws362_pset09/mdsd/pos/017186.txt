Although this story churns slowly and with a writing style that many of us are not used to, it makes up for it with a great, chilling story that sticks with you after the last pages are over.  This is one of those books you have to read in the quiet to concentrate on each word, but it is all the quiet that can make this book scare you.  James' obviously did a masterful job on the story, with his cliffhanger ending, because to this day, people are still giving their interpretation of it and what it means.  And this story was published over 100 years ago, in 1898.  Any author would LOVE to have people still talking about a book like that, for better or worse.  I love the characters throughout this story, and you begin to wonder what exactly is going on - is she seeing ghosts?  Are the kids seeing ghosts?  Has she lost her mind?  All good questions and at the end, you still might be scratching your head, but it is still a satsifying conclusion that lets your creative mind decipher it all.  In conclusion, this book is a pretty slow read considering it's only like 100 pages, but once you get half way, you're not going to want to put it down
