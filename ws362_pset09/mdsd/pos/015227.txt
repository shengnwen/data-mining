Thanks to Christine Prussing's book, I can now make jewellery using right angle weave, a stitch that has eluded me for years. There are a few typos but you can find the corrections. It's well worth the investment if you wish to make beautiful, unusual jewellery. 
She covers both single needle and two needle right angle weave. I prefer the two needle method; it is faster and works up evenly.
Thank you Chris!!
