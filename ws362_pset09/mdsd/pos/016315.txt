-than to grow up like Bone, a young girl from a poor Southern family, where both drinking and fighting are usual ways to spend your time.

It is not her immediate family, however, who are the worst. The Boatwright family sticks together, poverty, alcoholism and violence aside. Bone is loved and, in a way, also protected by her family. But it is still a rough life, also for Bone's mother, Anney.

When Anney marries Glen, things to seems to look brighter, but after a tragic event, Glen starts to take out his frustrations on Bone. It gets worse and worse, and the story is heartbreaking and very difficult to digest and understand. 

It is also a very fine piece of literature, and I cannot recommend this book enough
