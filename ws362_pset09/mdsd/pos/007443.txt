Book #25 in the In Death series.
In this book we find Eve confronted with a person from her past.  
Trudy Lombard is one of the foster moms who took care of Eve after she is found in Dallas.  Eve doesnt share the happy memories Trudy tries to force on her.  When Eve tells her to get lost she tries to get money from Roarke.  Roarke being Roarke tells her where to go and how to get there.  A few days later Trudy ends up dead.  Eve, ever the professional, puts all efforts into solving her murder.
Although I agree with the other reviewers that this mystery was easily solved, that wasn't my major complaint.
I gave this story only 4 stars because although it was good I expected so much more.  I really thought we were going to get some answers to some questions from Eve's past.  We really didn't learn anything new.  And to me we should have.  This story is really good, but it lacked some insight for me.
