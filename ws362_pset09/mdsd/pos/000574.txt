Nietzsche gives an historic account of how morality has developed in the world.  Unlike many others, Nietzsche takes a historical approach to the development of morality and gets into the etymology of the the ancient languages.  The &quot;good vs. bad/good vs. evil&quot; distinction is very  important to get a grasp of as well as the concepts of guilt, conscience,  and the ascetic ideal.  Along with Beyond Good and Evil, this book should  be one of the first by Nietzsche that you should read, in my opinion, to  get a good grasp on Nietzsche's thought.  Great analysis of Christianity  too
