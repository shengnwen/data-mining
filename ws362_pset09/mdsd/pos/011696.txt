   Kira-Kira is about Katie, a Japanese girl, and her family. They don't have much money and aren't always treated well. They eventually move so they would have a better life. Things do improve slightly, and they even get a house of their own, instead of renting a house or an apartment. Then  things worsen when Katie's sister Lynn gets ill, and her little brother Sam gets hurt. They have a lot of medical bills to pay, even when they aren't doing well with money.
    I gave it 4 stars. It is a sad book, but it is very interesting and somewhat suspenseful. I always wanted to keep reading. What will happen to Lynn? Would they get deep in debt? Find out yourself.
