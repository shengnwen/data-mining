Great book. Delicious, gourmet recipies. High calories- everything is butter, chocolate, buttermilk etc. but worth the treat once in a while! Who would think cupcakes could be so spe ical?  The cupcakes are one of the famous recipies from the Magnolia Bakery in New York- A++.  I have made quite a few recipies, just got the book a few weeks ago. Banana cake with white choc. and cream cheese icing- excellent.  Everything is superb! I am enjoying the book.
