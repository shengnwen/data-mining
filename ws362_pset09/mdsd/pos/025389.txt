I found this book to be amazing.  I have researched the various relgions of the world for several years now (never really seeing the big picture untill recently), but I found this to be still a kind of difficult read.  It was the first book that truely introduced to me some of the Qabalah, and it took a little bit of outside reasearch to get at this book.  From my findings though, one can not really read Regardie cover to cover without study (or a lot of previous knowledge).  I got a lot out of this book, and would recomend it to anyone willing to work through the material.      I found working through the material and doing the research to understand the book to be just as valuable as the book itself also.  A great starter on some of the more western esoteric traditions some (eastern stuff in there too)
