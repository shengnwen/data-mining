Ludlum has created a name for himself in the espionage genre by writing fast paced thrillers that entertain - and "The Aquitaine Progression" certainly fits that mould well.  It's not among his best, but certainly not among his worst novels either.  The plot is occasionally speckled with blasphemy and occasional profanity, the odd immoral tryst (although less so than what I recall from his other books), and regular killings of guys good and bad, but the main feature is the story-line itself.  Unlike some of his other novels, the main plot doesn't revolve around a cold war type scenario, but a world-wide conspiracy theory.  Joel Converse, an American lawyer, is informed of a global conspiracy (code-named "Aquitaine") to topple the leadership of every major government across the world through a series of carefully calculated military moves.  But Converse quickly discovers that his knowledge is dangerous, and soon he is on the run for his life, because the generals behind the Aquitaine can not afford to let him live.  What follows is typical high speed action from Ludlum, as Converse must flee from the hands of his pursuers, and yet find a way to rescue the world from the impending global violence.  All his ties to help are slowly cut, except that to his former wife.  Together, they must find a way to destroy Aquitaine.  The ending was somewhat of a let down, not featuring any real surprising twist, but this weakness aside, "The Aquitaine Progression" is a typically fast and entertaining ride, worthy of the name Ludlum on the front cover. -GODLY GADFL
