Jumanji is a great book! I am 23 years old now and I still remember the day my 2nd grade teacher read Jumanji to my class. I was hanging on her every word and the illustrations were absolutley amazing. This was in the year 1987 and up to that point I had never seen pictures so vividly and immaculately rendered. Jumanji was unlike any other book that I had read because it was fun, exciting, adventurous, and also eerie which added to the intrigue. I was very disappointed by the movie interpretation of it, because it's nothing like the real thing
