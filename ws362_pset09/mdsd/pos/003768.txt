        After reading this book more than once, and enjoying it every time, I truly believe I can assess this book with ease. I have found it each and every time written beautifully but understandably. The main character, Anne Shirley and the imaginative world she creates is even more so captivating.
	As the first book of the series, we are introduced to Anne who is rather predictable at times, but the things that L.M. Montgomery does to her and how it affects her life keeps me reading on and on. The flowery language is flowery only in it's descriptive ways and not too much that younger girls (and even boys) cannot comprehend it. Her adventures are another thing that makes it for everyone, you don't have to read profanity to be interested. To read of such a bright little girl growing into such a wise but evermore interesting should be good enough for everyone.
	She has many adventures, and at the beginning many could be called misadventures. Like, putting liniment in a cake instead of vanilla, such important a cake that it was meant for a role model of her's, the preacher's wife. Another, where a boy who secretly likes her calls her "carrots" and causes the poor dear to break a slate over his head. From then on a grudge would last for many a time.
       Over all I think the romanticism and appeal to every age makes this a book that will last in my heart and many others.
