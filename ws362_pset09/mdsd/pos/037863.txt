Tananarive Due is the first African-American woman to write books that verge on horror and often are pure urban fantasy.  Her characters are African and African-American.  The characters of other ethnic and racial backgrounds are peripheral to her stories.  This is her first novel.  I found it more dificult to read than The living Blood and My Soul To Keep , but only because the story construction is more complex.  Hilton James and his family (his wife is a newly elected judge) are threatened by a racist who promises to kill all of them.  The complexity is created by Hilton's previous life.  Did his grandmother die and come back to life to oversee Hilton's growing up?  Did Hilton drown as a boy or was he rescued by that same grandmother or both?  Due doesn't answer these questions.  She leaves the answers to the reader.  
This is an amazing debut novel.  Hers is a voice to remember and Hilton and his family will haunt your dreams.
