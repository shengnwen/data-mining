A very interesting discourse on the culture of warfare. He brings an interesting point of view to the table regarding how our culture determines the way we go to war. There has been some discussion on a 'western' way of going to war. And his analysis begins with the Greeks first defining the western way. ==From the Greeks he discusses some aspects of the ancient Chinese and other Eastern aspects, and goes on to discuss where East has fought West around the world. 

Over time also the ways of warfare have changed. To an extent this has come from equipment, but also from basic cultural differences between the fighting forces. The cultures of France and Germany were certainly different in the Ardennes in 1940. And the cultural differences between the Japanese and the Americans were immense. 

During the long Cold War, the cultures of the USSR and the USA were different, yet surprisingly close when compared with today's cultural differences between al Queda and the rest of us
