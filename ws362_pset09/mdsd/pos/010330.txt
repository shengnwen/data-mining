Building Harlequin's Moon is a satisfying book, however, if your taste is real Hard Sci-Fi then it probably will not be your cup of tea. The novel is more about people/relationships/human society than it is about anything else- A story SET in a science-fiction universe but not ABOUT one- if that makes any sense. Even so, I thought it was a nice deviation from other Sci-Fi work which tends to get itself bogged down in the most minute scientific details and neglect the story. If I wanted that much science in my life I'd pick up a scholarly journal not a novel. A novel should be about characters, story, and plot with the jargon that usually accompanies "Hard Science" unobtrusively playing its music in the background- Building Harlequin's Moon does this very well. The only criticism that I can offer is that the book's pace is slow at times and the abrupt ending. The questions about humans at Ymir and the long-term survival of Selene were just left up in the air. All things considered it was a satisfying read and perhaps the loose ends could be tied up in another novel? Here's hoping
