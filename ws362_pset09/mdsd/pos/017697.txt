I always enjoy anything Langston Hughes, my favorite author, writes and this was no exception.  Ironically, I'm doing a class project right now in which a teacher is trying to make the class keep the same strict culture, but the people in the class won't study the culture. It just reminds me of this book so much because many of the characters go from being totally proud of themselves regardless of appearance (but not fitting in with other black people) "Poor Little Black Fellow", to totally disregarding their color "Passing", to disrespecting their culture "Father to Son", to loving the culture but being in the wrong place at the wrong time "Home".  In each story, culture matters so much, but some people (like two in my group) just don't seem to care.  It's sad that this book is not recent, but fits perfectly with the ways of...you know the title
