This is one of my favorite books.  It is a story about culture, the insecurity racked years of adolescence, lives of immigrant families and their kids in London.  Zadie is a great story teller who brings all her characters to life with her descriptive writing and a wicked sense of humor.  I don't like to give away much during my reviews so you'll just have to read it to find out.  Worth all the accolades it has received
