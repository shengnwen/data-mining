This is mostly a "Just do it" book.  Its a quick read that flows well and gives you the information you need. The only thing it didn't get right for me was taking into consideration that some people have had a lot of sex before the start of a long term relationship... then it pitters out in the long haul. However the information given on how many people feel during the lack of desire times was great.
Focuses on both the low desire partner and the higher desire partner well
