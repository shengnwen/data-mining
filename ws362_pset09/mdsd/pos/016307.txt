The Unseen Queen is the second book in the Dark Nest trilogy and like the first book I found it to be great adventure in the Star Wars universe. I particularly loved the way that Troy Denning cleverly continued the Killik hive mind/Force parallel that he began in The Joiner King, it really sets the Killik situation up to be a source of further understanding for the Jedi and for me a thought provoking new way to look at the force that still gels with the spirit of the films. 

Troy Denning also shows great skill at writing interesting political characters for example Chief of State Cal Omas being portrayed as not a cardboard cut out straight out good or bad guy, but simply a man concerned about preserving the good he has done since taking office. The Unseen Queen also has a number of very funny subplots especially the part about Luke, Han, and Starship replicas which a I found hilarious, plus the action scenes are also good with all the major characters getting to show their skill in either fighting or flying. There are also some great examples of Dennings own characters such as Saba Sebatyne, Jae Juun and Tarfang playing important roles and being as interesting to read about as the classic ones. All these things combined with a exciting plot focusing on preventing the Killik blockade from boiling over into war makes for a great addition to the Star Wars story.


This book in my opinion is slightly better than The Joiner King as its pacing is improved with a more interesting beginning to the story, but my only negative point is that it eneded too quickly and i wished it could have been longer. Troy Denning again shows a great deal of skill at writing in the Star Wars universe and in my opinion the Dark Nest trilogy is up their with his other great books such as New Jedi Order: Star by Star and Tatooine Ghost
