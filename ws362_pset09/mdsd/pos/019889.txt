This short, brilliant novel attempts to answer the question "Do we live by accident and die by accident, or live by plan and die by plan." A well-traveled, primitive bridge in Peru collapses one day in the early 1700s, sending five people to their deaths. Brother Juniper, a Spanish friar, is sent to investigate; he reveals to us the life stories of the five victims. The five people represent a mixture of the proud, the contrite, the sick at heart. Brother Juniper is convinced their deaths are a just act of God, for which he is condemned by the Church and burned at the stake. Countering Brother Juniper's view is Wilder, who believes that the answer to the question is not decidedly accident or plan, but an ambiguous combination of the two. Above all, he claims, is the love that was involved in each person's life: this love "will have been enough; all those impulses of love return to the love that made them. There is a land of living and a land of dead and the bridge is love."

Wilder develops his theme and characters superbly; the characters whose lives are lost at the bridge are beautifully fleshed out. In fact, "beautiful" might be the best word to use to describe the book - it's almost poetic, especially in its concerns with love. Wilder won a Pulitzer for this, his second novel. It's a memorable work by a master craftsman and wordsmith.
