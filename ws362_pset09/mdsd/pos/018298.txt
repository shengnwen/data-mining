A better book could not have fallen into my hands!  An American professor in Venice recommended it, and after I read it I was only sorry I had not read it before going to Italy.  The mystery of its medieval, rather Renaissance cities (Florence, Venice, among others) would have been clearer; even today's Italians' ways and personality.  So much a product of Renaissance Italy...and its wonderful heritage from Ancient Rome.  I truly recommend this book for Italy lovers, anyone going there soon, or for the sheer joy of reading a good history book.  Jacob Burckkhardt is one of the most intelligent, enlightened historians I know
