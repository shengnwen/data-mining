I felt as if I had read this book before. Maybe Brave New World. I just finally felt that I didn't care what happened to these clones. But the clones didn't seem to care either. All through the last half of the book,I kept muttering, "can't they run away?". The acceptance of their lot in life drove me to despair. Nevertheless this was a good read and I will read other books of his. He does have a spare and readable style
