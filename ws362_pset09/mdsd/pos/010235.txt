The writing here is a great example of modern fiction that is American to it's core.  After reading this I had to get more Richard Ford and just finished Independence Day which is like a modern day cross between Moby Dick and Ulysses.

The pieces in this book all have the same titillating topic but each treats it from a different angle (and locale) and unravels the consequences in a unique way.  The story about the Grand Canyon is jaw-dropping, especially if you've been there.  I went back and immediately re-read 'Puppy' too
