Writers, artists and journalists all went to Paris after World War I with the dreams of becoming writers: Paris offered a big advantage in providing jobs which enabled them to make the most of the city, and after the war American news activity shifted from London to Paris. NEWS OF PARIS: AMERICAN JOURNALISTS IN THE CITY OF LIGHT BETWEEN THE WARS provides a focus on this heyday when the city was lauded as the 'centre of American journalism in Europe'. Chapters survey the colorful world of this expatriate period and uses the lives of major literary figures and newspapers to reveal the drama and hopes of the times.
