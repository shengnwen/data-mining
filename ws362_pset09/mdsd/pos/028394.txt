The photos are so luscious--I can't think of a more appropriate term--that it's as if you're in these gardens.  I believe all of the photos are of the ancient gardens in Kyoto, and if not, they're definately all from Japan.  This book is truly one that was inspired by the Sakuteki, not an illustrated edition of the Sakuteki.  You'll want it for dreamy page turning, not as an instruction book for your own gardens
