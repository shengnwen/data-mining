This is a delightful book, and in many ways: 

1. It describes the life of a wonderfully interesting lady who didn't stay just home and make babies. 

2. It gives a picture of Washington D.C. as it existed at the time of the Civil War. This picture is in two parts: 
a. the physical aspects, the filth, smell, and how life was lived, and 
b. the way Washington worked then (and now) power, money and sex. 

3. It is based on new information -- her diary, originally thought to have been written in code, but in fact just very poor penmanship. 

The story starts with a message sent to Gen. P.G.T Beauregard to give him an week's notice of when the Union Army would attack Manassas (Bull Run). He used this information to order reinforcements that enabled him to defeat the yankees. Through the course of the war Rose would be caught, imprisoned (without habeas corpus to even know the charges against her). She was exiled to the South, where she was sent by President Davis to France and England to try to get them to assist the South. 

This is a fascinating book. All the more so because it is true. Rose was a character born long before her time
