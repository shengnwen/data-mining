I knew I'd love this book at the description, but that may be bias as I love improvisation.  At first scan I see that a college instructor of mine used the book front to back for a class of mine - and good choice, as I loved all the things we did in that class!

Taking an improv class can be a risky thing if you get a bad teacher.  Ruth knows her practice in and out, and knows all the important stuff to cover - including dealing with emotinal issues.  She also communicates the exercises very sweetly and clearly.  As a teacher, it's nice to have mediations written out so you don't have to think on the spot and still come across calmly and clearly.  So if you're taking a class or teaching a class or aren't sure yet if you want to do either - get this book, and you'll have an intimate understanding of the form and lots of fun
