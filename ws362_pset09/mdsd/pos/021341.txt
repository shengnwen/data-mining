The play "Our Town" was a well written play, and I would recommend anyone to read it. The play is very short and simple yet you get the feel of what life is like for the characters. I felt like I was another person living with them. I liked how Thornton Wilder divided the play up into 3 acts. I like how he had the settings for the acts: act one being the past, act two being the present, and act three being the future. The only downfall for the play was the ending. I have to day I was very disappointed. Why was it that he had the dead people talking? I also wish that Thornton Wilder would have gone into more detail with Act 2 and describing the wedding between Rebecca and George. Everybody has their daily schedules and for people living in the city, their schedule is different from people living in the country. I believe that this play really made me see the insight into how simple life really can be. We take for granted the little things that we have in life. While reading this play I really realized how important having a grounded community. I liked how Thornton Wilder had the people play the roles of people we see in our community everyday. I also liked how he skipped form family to family to let you know what they were going through. The most unique thing I liked was that he was very simple with the stage manager and stage directions. A good book for anyone to review.
