Set behind the scenes of Hawaii during the 80's, the docter's portrayal of hawaii is by far one of his finest books. Growing up in hawaii, I recommend this book whole heartedly for its mixture of truth and surealism to portray hawaii the way I remember it. 
He discribes the Hawaii's drug culture and tourism industry perfectly. 
Definatly a must read if your a fan of Hunter Thompsons work
