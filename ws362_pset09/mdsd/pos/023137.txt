The Voorster family is an average American family at the start of Noel's "Halfway House." But this typical family is thrown into upheaval when the eldest child, Angie, is diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. The author escorts the reader on a personal tour of a family that is coming apart at the seams under the weight of Angie's illness.

I was very impressed by this novel. Noel is to be commended for her outstanding work. Noel presented the struggle of each family member with grace and elegance. The entire Voorster family was tangible as I read this work. I was able to connect to her characters and really care about them. 

I highly recommend this novel
