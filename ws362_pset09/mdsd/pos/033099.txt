     I really liked this book. I liked this book because I relates to me and what I like.  This book relates to me because I like basketball and so does Bix and Jerome. They like to play alone and really work on their game and so do I.  At the end they finally get togethor and work on it.  That is what my dad and I do.  So I would recomend this book to anyone who likes sports.
