This is our first Otto and Uncle Tooth book but I doubt it will be our last.  The story was cute without talking down to children.  There was actual plot continuity and mystery -- Gasp!  There was a villain, a small amount of danger, and a little excitement.  

As the "School Library Journal" has done a good job of describing the storyline, I will give you my take on the book as a reader; because if you are like me and have a young reader at home you are probably wondering about just this thing.  As you no doubt know, reading levels for children vary tremendously before third grade, I will tell you that this book has larger text, but that there is quite a lot of it (relatively speaking) for some children.  If you go to another Otto and Uncle Tooth book -- "The Mystery of the Pirate Ghost" -- you will be able to see what the artwork and text looks like:  the 'search inside this book' feature is active on this book and it to is a Level 4 book in the "Step into Reading" series. 

Four Stars.  [B+].  A nice reader that has a fun story that doesn't talk down to children.  The artwork is cute and it makes for a good read-aloud.  As for reading level, I suggest you look at the book mentioned above which is at the same level so you can judge for yourself
