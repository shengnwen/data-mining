One interested in the subject should first read Speer's `Inside the Third Reich' and `Spandau.' Fest's biography is also worthy. That said, Sereny's work is by far the most insightful and articulate. She accurately portrays the Faustian dilemma of a talented, ambitious man and gently but completely demolishes his Nüremburg defense (ignorance but responsibility) in interviews (much like a confessor).

Speer seems at last to have admitted to himself he knew about the final solution (as indeed he did).

Sereny's masterpiece is the tenacious profile of a celebrity's motives in criminal behavior and association, and how he rationalized that dilemma (instrumental to the commission).

Also recommeded: the author's `Into That Darkness" and "The Healing Wound.
