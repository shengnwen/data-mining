As a psychologist this book put me in touch with a very different theoretical approach to whats going on in the therapy room. This is not a book for beginners or for somebody that heard about "people playing mental games". This book is about a very specific psychological theory thus needs deep studying not just reading.
I really enjoyed the clarity of the book, but the language get very technical a times
