I can't remember why exactly I bought this book.

But some of the reasons were.

1.- The book give you a blueprint on how to start in real state with out money(Something that seem to be pretty useful for me)

2.- Robert Allen has been mentioned in one of the latest book of Richard Bandler the creator of Neurolinguistic Programming. He said they ran some seminars in San Francisco where Robert got people that have always been unsucsessfull in life and he turned into millionaires with his method.

3.- Now I remember the third reason, it was that Robert Allen and The guy fom Chicken Soul for the Soul wrote a book, the One Minute Millionaire, and I loved that book, I finish reading the theory part in one day, I really loved that book so I decided to keep reading from those authors since Robert was the only one that got more theory books and I wanted to get into the real state without money so here I went.

The overall information seem useful and really possible he outlines that you have to find people that don't want their house anymore, they are either moving or need the money fast, so here's your chance.
The problem I got is that in Mexico because of the laws this is not easy, you have to pay like 10 to 15% each time you sell your house to some agency, so it is ridiculous, however I guess this book might work
