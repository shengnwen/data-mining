Loved it. This book answered alot of questions. I don't believe every thing that was stated, But that is the main reason that i loved this book. It was nice to know that someone is willing to research and publish a book no matter on what people think. I think that is a blessing to know that Mary Magdalene was not the fallen women she was made out to be, but a founder of early christianity. If your a fundmentalist you should have never picked up this book to begin with. My thanks to the author..
