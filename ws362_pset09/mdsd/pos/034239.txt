Graham Greene novels are like pizza.  Even the bad ones are good.
And this one is far from bad.  Granted, it's another journey into life's laments, which Greene is exceptionally skilled at, but like the best of
his other work, the journey is filled with interesting sojourners you're
pleased to spend a couple of hundred pages with.  And happily, his storytelling prowess and dramatic plotting are both fellow journeymen as well.

In Burnt Out Case, Greene takes us deep into Africa, and the parallels to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness are easily made.  But Greene's story of lepers and healers and builders and believers is its own.  Replete with the lies, misunderstandings, regrets and revenge that often populate Green's pages, you can rest assured that not unlike life, what can go wrong, will. go   But in the hands of a skilled writer like Greene, you consider yourself lucky for having been along for the ride.

Burnt Out Case is well worth a dark trip down the winding river of men's souls
