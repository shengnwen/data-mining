Though I can sympathize with them, the reviewers that complain about Harrison's rambling style and lack of focus in True North are unfortunately missing the point of the book.  Those that stick with it will be generously rewarded.

This is first and foremost a novel of self-discovery and self-definition.  Unfortunately, such journeys are not packaged neatly into a 3:15 song, a 90 minute movie, or 250 page tightly plotted novel (if someone knows the trick of discovering one's self in such a fashion, please post).  And that's the poorly-kept secret of this book: a person's journey to find and perhaps save himself is a rambling, chaotic, often incoherent one and it's not going to fit well into our 20th/21st century indoctrinated idea of plot or novel.

In the hands of almost anyone else, such an approach would turn into a plodding, stumbling account of banalities, of burnt breakfasts and waiting in doctor's offices.  This is not the case in True North. Harrison uses his wit, poetic training, and incredible clarity of observation to produce a wonderful inside view of David Burkett's struggle to make sense of his own life's story.  

For those that couldn't stick with it, I suggest you put down your latest Dan Brown pablum and try True North again, this time with patience
