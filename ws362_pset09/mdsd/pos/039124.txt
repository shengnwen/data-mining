This Book Was cool,cool,cool! This is definitely the best book I have read! And I read about ten chapter books a day! I liked the part where Tal killed the Emperess. That was cool! I like Tal's Spiritshadow, too! If it wern't for him, Tal would've been dead a long time ago! Tal enemy shushin, is an complete dimwit! He probably couldn't find his way out of an empty room! I probably kill myself if the sixth book doesn't come out soon
