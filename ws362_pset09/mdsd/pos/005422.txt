 SPOILERS!! BE WARNED

This book is so freaky and thats why its great.  Its got a horror touch to it as those robots are pretty scary the way it does evil but acts like its doing perfectly righteous acts.  One reviewer mentioned that the main character is not likable. I dont know what he's talking about because the main character is totally great, honorable, just, basically everything you want in a human being or a hero.  The story is great because you can never guess whats going to happen next.  It keeps changing.  The ending at first seems pretty horrible, and I didnt realy like it but I think if it didnt end this way this book woudnt of made such an impact.   Oh and this book is exactly like that one star trek episode from the original series called NOMAD where that machine tried to "steralize" everything one but killing it.
