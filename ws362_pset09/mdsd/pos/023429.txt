More than one professor with whom I have worked have called Stahl their "hero."  Although some professionals disagree with some of his assertions, I have not spoken to one colleague who hasn't been impressed by his insights and ability to present information in a clear fashion.  Even if you find other books on psychopharmacology that you like better, you can't go wrong with getting Stahl's perspective on the topic.  If you are very serious minded, then his diagrams might seem a little "cutesy" at times.  However, for visual learners his diagrams highlight neurological mechanisms so you can get a clear picture in your mind about different mechanisms of action.  Obviously, these physiological mechanisms are not as simplistic as drawn, but the drawings give the reader a clearer picture of what he is writing about.  If you are serious about learning the essentials of psychopharmacology, then this is a great book to read
