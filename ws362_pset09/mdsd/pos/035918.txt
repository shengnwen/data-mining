I don't know, this is quite a good little book but something is definitely missing. It covers a lot on oscillator theory but when I needed to build a special saw tooth oscillator, it had no information at all. It seems to have a blind spot for practical circuits and ideas and above all certain equations. (scratching my head I wondered if the censors had banned oscillators slightly recently) It is still a good book though and if you've never seen a klystron before is very interesting
