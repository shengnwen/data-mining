Admittedly, this intriguing little tome is a mixed bag, with regards to quality, yet redeemed by excellent essays from the likes of Ursula K. Le Guin, Michael Swanwick, Poul Anderson, Orson Scott Card, Harry Turtledove and Douglas Anderson. Le Guin's essay is the literary home run, emphasizing the literary qualities found in Tolkien's writing. Running a close second are those penned by Swanwick and Anderson, in which they acknowledge Tolkien's strong influence on their careers as fantasy writers. Douglas Anderson writes an excellent literary overview of Tolkien's career as a writer and academic, noting his other published works besides those pertaining to Middle-earth. Although these essays will be appreciated mostly by the converted, skeptics of Tolkien's work may begin to understand it by reading the essays I've cited herein
