Amazon, in their wisdom, links audio and print versions of books together such that a review for one edition also shows up on the product pages for all of the other editions. This may be suitable for most books, but Amazon shouldn't have done it for "Everything's Eventual" for a very simple reason:

The print version of "Everything's Eventual" contains 14 short stories.

The audio version of "Everything's Eventual" contains only 5 short stories!

The audio versions of the remaining 9 short stories are published separately.

The collection "The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales" contains the audio versions of "The Man in the Black Suit", "All That You Love Will Be Carried Away", "The Death of Jack Hamilton", and "That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French".

The collection "Blood and Smoke" contains the audio versions of "1408", "In the Deathroom" and "Lunch at the Gotham Cafï¿½".

Finally, "Riding the Bullet" and "LT's Theory of Pets" are individual products each containing the audio version of only one short story.

This review is primarily for people who are considering buying the audio version of "Everything's Eventual". I'll start by saying a few words about each of the five stories.


"Everything's Eventual" - 3 stars

This is a fairly long (2 hours) story about a young guy with a strange supernatural power - he can kill people by remote control. The story is interesting, and yet it doesn't really grab you, and the ending is disappointing.


"Autopsy Room Four" - 5 stars

The best story of the five! A man comes to consciousness but is totally paralyzed, and discovers that he is assumed to be dead and a doctor is about to perform an autopsy on him! I was so scared that I hardly dared to continue listening to the story.


"The Little Sisters of Eluria" - 3 stars

Too long (almost 3 hours), too silly, and Roland (the main character, from "The Dark Tower" series) acts like an amateur instead of the hard-boiled experienced gunslinger he is supposed to be. Roland is seriously injured and awakes in a kind of nightmare hospital. Then he manages to flee with the help of, well, someone. Ho-hum.


"Lucky Quarter" - 4 stars

A "what if" story, about a chambermaid who gets a tip of only 25 cents from a hotel guest. But it's a lucky quarter and using it in a slot machine starts the chambermaid on a path to riches. Or does it? Perhaps it was only a dream? Short (30 minutes) but effective.


"The Road Virus Heads North" - 4 stars

An author of horror books (now who could that be based on?) buys a scary painting at a yard sale. Only it turns out that this painting really is scary. The artist committed suicide and the new owner isn't likely to survive owning this painting either.


So, one very good story, two fairly poor ones and two in between. An OK collection, although a bit disappointing. The stories are read by five different professional readers, and all of them do a good job.

If audio books aren't your thing then you should buy "Everything's Eventual" as a printed book instead. Then you get all 14 stories, and it's cheaper too.
