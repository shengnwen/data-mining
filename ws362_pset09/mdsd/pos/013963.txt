After suffering for more than an year with chronic back pain and
being advised by a neurologist that I had an enlarged spinal disk
pressing on my sciatic nerve I ended up in an emergency room a
year later where the doctor prescribed a muscle relaxant and advised me to buy books in the book store on back pain. I still
have a sore back on rainy days but I can now lift up to forty
pounds and suffer from no sciatic pain at all. I rave about this
book to anyone who will listen
