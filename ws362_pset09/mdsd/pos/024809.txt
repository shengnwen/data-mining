No praise is too high for this book, which is exceptionally entertaining as well as informative. Its most attractive quality is the way that it gets behind the newspaper headlines and gives a real sense of what life is like  in the hugely different regions of Spain. Particularly interesting on the  modern Spanish Catholic church and on youth culture
