The vast majority of Americans believe that the U.S. is engaged in a "Culture War,"  Indeed, this is true, but where they go wrong is in assuming that the war is carried out by two titanic forces known as the Democrat and Republican parties - the white and black-hatted combatants, or the black and white-hatted combatants, depending upon where the observer stands.  The truth is that BOTH parties are wearing black hats, and the raging battle played out daily in Washington and the various media outlets is for public consumption only.  The REAL war theater is elsewhere.

My best analogy is a "Punch-And-Judy" show.  While the audience (the public at large) is engrossed in the fisticuffs between two warring enemies, behind the scenes, a single entity controls both participants.  If you wish to see beyond the marionettes and get a look at the puppeteer, you'll need to read printed material that exists outside of The Establishment's  imprimatur.  Such as James Perloff's, 'THE SHADOWS OF POWER.'

I can hear a few of you balking already: "It sounds like he's referring to a...a...a...(shhh)...conspiracy."  Welcome to the REAL world, friend.  It's about time you woke up and smelled the arsenic!  'THE SHADOWS OF POWER' is a well-researched and well-written expose on the heart of the matter: The Council On Foreign Relations - which is not "Ground Zero" of the Conspiracy, but it does represent the visible moving parts, the meshing gears, the framers and roofers and electricians building 'The New World Order' structure from the blueprint provided by the "architects" hidden from public view - the "wizards" behind the curtain.  More than you know, you need to read this book if you.....

* Have no idea what the C.F.R. is and wants.

* Think the Federal Reserve, which controls the U.S. economy, is a government agency.

* Wonder why the U.S. sent young men to fight Communism in Asia only 3 years after permitting (and assisting in) the establishment of a Soviet satellite just 150 miles off the coast of Florida.

* Still can't figure out how and why the U.S. lost that war with two-bit Communists in Asia.

* Were watching nice little stories on the Seven O'Clock news about Presidents Bill 'n' Hill [*See them tote their Bible to church and sing praises with the congregation.]; their nice daughter, Chelsea; and their nice little dog, Buddy, while sensitive technology with military capability was being sold to the Red Chinese without comment from the mainstream media.

One chapter of particular interest is 'A Second Look At Ronald Reagan.'  Reagan "chalked up more government debt than all the Presidents before him COMBINED!"  He was touted as an enemy of taxation and big government, and yet, although he did cut tax rates, "also pushed through the largest single tax increase in our nation's history, as well as boosts in the gasoline and Social Security taxes."  Although critical of Jimmy Carter for abiding by the Salt II Treaty, which the Senate didn't ratify, later as President, Reagan ordered two Poseidon ballistic missile submarines DISMANTLED to ensure we stayed within Salt II limits.  And that's just the beginning!

'The Media Blackout' chapter is also very enlightening.  Here we learn of Nicaragua's former President, Anastasio Somoza's complaint about the deliberate hatchet job he received at the hands of Dan Rather and 60 Minutes.  It reveals the power to promote an agenda and sway the public perception that major print and media outlets possess.  And it should force most Americans to reconsider how many of their current beliefs might have been artificially induced by the manipulative mainstream media.

Perloff wrote this book while a member of The John Birch Society.  Hopefully by now he's realized that the J.B.S. is less than sincere in its efforts to combat global Collectivism.  Although the book was published in 1988, it's every bit as relevant now as it was then because the C.F.R. program hasn't changed - evidenced by today's headlines, and discerned by anyone who knows how the game is played.

If there's ONE thing I've learned in studying politics over these many years, it's this: It's NEVER what politicians SAY that counts; it's strictly what they DO.  To the detriment of the People of the United States, when the Democrat party takes power, it usually keeps its campaign promises.  Equally detrimental, the Republican party doesn't.  And because I love the U.S. Constitution, I despise them both!  Get this book and see who's standing in the shadows and pulling the strings on those two puppets.
