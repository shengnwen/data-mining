I am an avid reader, and I guess I just assumed if this author was good, I would have read him by now.  Well, this book was the first I have read by Kellerman, and I had a hard time putting it down!  Not one of those books where you can guess &quot;who done it&quot; about half way through.  This one keeps you guessing 'till the end.  I know that there are several other &quot;Alex Davenport&quot; (the main character) books by Kellerman, and I am anxious to read them all
