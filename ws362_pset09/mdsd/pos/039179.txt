Jack Gilbert is an excellent poet.  Like all books of poetry, this volume has many wonderful poems and a few clunkers. Sometimes his poem endings are a wonderful surprise or a shock which is the mark of a excellent craftsman which he certainly is. That said,a few poems in the volume shoot themselves in the foot with contrived endings. Definitely recommended
