This was a fantastic book and was fairly different from any other book I have read before. The book really explained how today's culture affects brands. Klein explained branding has completely emerged into our societey and that the successful companies are no longer selling simply products. Instead they are selling products with assosiatiions and lifestyles. I really learned a lot from this book and it opened my eyes to how right Klein was about advertising in our societies. I feel that today's culture has completely become obsessed wuth brands
