I have had this book for quite some time and would recommend it to anyone looking for extensive information on German Shepherd Kennels of the past and present.  It also contains valuable information on health, diseases and how to, all forms of service dogs, Schutzhund, pictures of good hips, bad hips and all hips in between as well as movement whys and wherefores.  If I could recommend just one book and no other was available, this would be it. I have been in possession of many books on German Shepherds but this has the most extensive information I've seen in one publication
