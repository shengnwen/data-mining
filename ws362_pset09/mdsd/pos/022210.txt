"Death Dujour" is the second novel in the Temperance "Tempe" Brennan series by Kathy Reichs. In this installment, Tempe's case stretches from Montreal to the Carolinas as young teaching assistant disappears, an arson fire attempts to hide the murder of 7 people and a long dead Catholic nun is about to receive sainthood.

"Death Dujour" was an excellent read! The synopsis may sound a bit convoluted, but it's really not. This novel didn't grab me the way "Deja Dead" did when I first picked up the novel. I had to allow "Death Dujour" to progress a bit before the story became engrossing. Lots of surprises and twists in this novel. Definitely worth reading
