This book provides  a basis for accountability in making trades as you do. I found the psychological part the best. It is somewhat hard to implement the basic structure required by the author for me personally. However it all rings truth in it's wording. This is a work book and therefore leads the reader through a series of questions to let you know how good you understand the basic fundamentals prescribed of his book "Trading For A Living".
   It has increased awareness and led me to stop making the same repetitive mistakes. And that is the basis for success in trading.
