Thank goodness I picked this one up. My bookshelf was full of books that were too harsh (like Gary Ezzo on scheduling babies), too condescending (&quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot;), or relied too much on anecdotal research (like &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by William Sears, an otherwise wonderful  book).  Mr. White's goal is to help you develop your infant into a happy, &quot;delightful&quot; two year old who is a good companion. His methods ring true to one who is very nurturing, but has heard the folk wisdom about spoiling a baby.  Do your baby a favor and read either this book or his other, shorter one called &quot;How to Raise A Happy, Unspoiled Child.&quot
