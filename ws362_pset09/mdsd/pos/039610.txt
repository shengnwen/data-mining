Perhaps I haven't read too many books, but this is the first book I've read that mentioned a same sex relationship. I thought I was reading the wrong words at first. It was really interesting. I wasn't too comfortable  with it at first, then later on I got used to it. I give the author all the  props for such a different approach. The mystery itself isn't bad either.  It wasn't putting me to sleep. The beginning was catching my attention  already, it wasn't one of those typical boring openings. It was a good  book
