Even after an extensive education in classical literature, I had a great number of preconceived opinions about the behavior of Achilles in The Iliad.  Dr. Shay's book not only pulverized my narrow-minded judgements, but opened a whole new world of understanding for me as to the kind of living hell the veterans of the Viet Nam war (and surely, those wars of the last ten years) suffered, and are still suffering.  Finally, it helped me to understand things about my own father (also a Viet Nam veteran) that he himself simply had no way of explaining, even to himself, let alone his family.  Rarely have I come across a scholarly work so powerfully written and relevant to the issues of today.  Dr. Shay has authored a remarkable book!  Thank you, Dr. Shay
