. . .and what a fascinating trip!  Dominic Corde--such aninsensitive cad in the Cater Street Hangman--turns up here in the lastplace you'd expect to find a man of his calibre--and he's a likely suspect in the first murder case in this outing.  Unlike some of the other readers, I didn't really mind that Emily was on vacation and Great-Aunt Vespasia was only in one scene.  Life's like that, folks. Hey, you give me a choice between going to Rome and meddling in a politically nasty murder investigation and I'll say, arrivederci, baby:) Dominic is definitely the center-stage, pivotal character in this book.  Everyone in this book except maybe Gracie, Tellman, and the Pitt children has been deeply affected in some way by what he was, is, or is perceived to be.  I've reread this book three or four times just to savor the wonderful interplay between Dominic and Thomas, as well as Charlotte's coming to terms with her past feelings for Dominic--a perspective that also proves pivotal as the book draws to a close.  Borrow it if you don't want to buy it. .
