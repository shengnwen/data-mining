And boy am I glad to see her!  I bought the first sparkley "Fancy Nancy" for my 3 year old granddaughter, Mary Mace, and she LOVES the book.  It's one of her favorites.  I pre-ordered this one and Mary Mace got it the day after her baby brother was born!  Her Daddy read it to her right away and she adored the story of the posh puppy.  In fact, when they all were leaving the hospital to bring the new baby home, Mary's Daddy said to her Mom:  "What's the matter . . are you sad to leave this *posh* room?"  LOL!  Mary Mace explained to her Mom that posh was a fancy word for fancy.  Ahem!  Even Daddy's can learn new words.

The story is about Nancy's neighbor getting a fancy dog called a Papillon.  Nancy decides she wants one, too, that is until she 'babysits' the dog and realizes that it's not as much fun as her friends' plain old dogs because it doesn't like to play and fetch.  It just likes to sit around looking pretty all day!  So Nancy's Mom takes her to the animal shelter where she finds a Poodle named "Frenchie" who is just right for her.  This is a fabulous book with a great moral and the artwork is magnificent.  A perfect book for any little boy or girl who loves stories
