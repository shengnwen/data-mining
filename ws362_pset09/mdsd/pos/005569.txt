The Granny by Brendan O'Carroll is the third and last book in the trilogy which began with The Mammy.  And its only fitting that in my opinion this is the best book of the three. 

It's hard to believe that the girl Agnes of The Young Wan and mother and widow of The Mammy is now a grandmother but that's exactly what happens when her oldest son's wife has a baby. And while Agnes is adjusting to this endearing term, she still has her other five children to worry about. Her daughter isn't very 
happily married it appears, oen son lands in prison and anotehr one moves far away from home to puruse his dreams of being an artist.  And in a hilarious scene, Pierre, Agnes's lover attempts to adds some excitement to their love lives.

While this is one of the sadder books in the trilogy it is true to life and has a fitting ending. Agnes is finally reunited with all of her children and grandchildren and knows that in addition to loving them, she is also loved by them.

I hated to end this book since Agnes and her family were like mmebers of my family while I read this book.  Even now I  continue to think about them and hope they are well.  I  hope  that the author will continue to either write about Agnes's children or he will write a new book about an equally 
wonderful character as Agnes Browne.
