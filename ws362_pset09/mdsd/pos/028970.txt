Love and Respect is a wonderful book! It really helped me understand many things.   It deals with situations in which a man or woman is responsible for discord in the relationship. This is one topic I have learned about in the past, and thought I had really implemented in my life, but I was amazed at how much I still did not understand about the way men think and respond. Read this book even if you're not having marital problems
