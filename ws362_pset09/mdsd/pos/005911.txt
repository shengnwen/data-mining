Andre and I were in the Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa at the same time.  We lived on Brown Street, neighbors and friends.  I noted his dedication, his sincerity, his love of language.  Those qualitites  continued to grow in his writing over the years.  He produced some amazing  works.  I mourn his death and and applaud his writing.  I recommend it to  anyone seeking excellence in the written word. Douglas Kent Hal
