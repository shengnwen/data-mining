At 150 pages, this can be a one-sitting read. Being easy to understand makes the material suitable and accessible for a variety of ages.

The premise is that our beliefs about ourselves, regardless of where the information came from, are considered agreements because we as individuals have come to accept or agree with what we have been told. We all possess the personal power to choose happiness or suffering. In each of us exists the Judge and the Victim. We are very good at punishing ourselves through self-rejection based on what we have come to believe about ourselves. 

If a person chooses happiness, it is attainable through four decisions or steps, known here as agreements. The four agreements are: Be impeccable with your word, Don't take anything personally, Don't make assumptions, and Always do your best. 

Everyone has wounds. Simply put, this is an inspirational book illuminating a path toward healing through changing self-perception.  I would not label it a self-help book or consider it about philosophy or religion either. As billed on the cover, it is a "practical guide to personal freedom".
