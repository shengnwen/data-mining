"American Sphinx" is not the place to begin a study of the life of Thomas Jefferson. In the introduction, Joseph Ellis comments that before joining the plethora of published analyses and biographies of Jefferson, the historian had better be prepared to bring some new insights to the life of this most revered of the Founders. Ellis chose for his subtitle, "The Character of Thomas Jefferson", and it is Jefferson's character that Ellis explores, in snippets that leap forward from scene to scene in Jefferson's life, as if Ellis were a time-traveler checking in periodically on his subject while Jefferson the man moves through a life that is now considered hallowed history. Ellis assumes that his reader is already familiar with the larger moments of Jefferson's life, as well as the surrounding history, and so skips over these. The reader who is new to Jefferson, therefore, should start elsewhere.

"American Sphinx" was published a few years before the DNA tests in 1998 which proved that some of Sally Hemings' children did indeed carry the Y chromosome of the Jefferson family, probably from Thomas himself or his brother Randolph. Because the DNA evidence cannot narrow the paternity of Sally Hemings' children any further, Ellis' arguments against Thomas Jefferson as their father still hold up, and remain as reasonable as they could also be inaccurate. Despite a wealth of circumstantial evidence that can swing either way, any final judgment must be taken simply on faith.

And "taken on faith" seems to be how Jefferson's life must be viewed. He represents so much to so many about the founding spirit of the United States that he is often worshipped along the lines of a Joshua or other prophet. Ellis seems to hold Jefferson up to this same hero-worship status, but through lines of often dry prose and some confusing sentence structure (Ellis does not set off his prepositional phrases with commas), the reader begins to get the queasy feeling that Jefferson may not have been the man that we have all wanted him to be. He begins to come across as petty and insecure, with a naï¿½ve outlook on humanity that carried on even into his waning years. It was always easy to write off Jefferson' sharper declarations (The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants) as youthful enthusiasm, but his convictions against a governing structure for the United States apparently never changed, leaving John Adams to question Jefferson's sanity while even James Madison had to shake his head from time to time. Ellis almost appears to have been startled by these revelations, and struggles to keep Jefferson atop a pedestal even as the evidence tries to topple the whole thing.

All in all, "American Sphinx" is a sobering exercise in the realities of greatness; that in the end the Founding Fathers--and Jefferson in particular--were all very human and just as capable of error as anyone; that the founding of the United States was neither a clear-cut goal of rationality nor even a consensus, but was rather a struggle of ideology pulled toward the center by camps who were alarmingly polarized even in the eighteenth century. But even as the dichotomies of Jefferson's life descend into disingenuousness, we can still ask with some reverence: Where would we have been without him?
