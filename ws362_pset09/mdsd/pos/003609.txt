Overall, this book brought a major problem of social work clearly into focus: the emergence of psychotherapy. Prior to reading the book, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do in my future profession, but now I've slightly altered that goal. This book won't be eye opening for everyone, but much of the material presented is very interesting and thought-provoking. I am glad to have read it.
