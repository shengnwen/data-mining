I don't think that it's a coincidence that I shot my best score ever after reading this book.  Rotella speaks frankly about going through your preshot routine, choosing your target and trusting your swing.  Golfers would be far better off  practicing the items mentioned above as opposed to thinking of complicated swing thoughts prior to hitting the ball.  This is one golf instructional book that I will refer back to again & again.  An outstanding read
