I have make several of the recipes in this book and they ALL have turned out fabulous. Some of my friends even offered me money for the cakes. As far as the reveiwers that mentioned the liquors, I  couldn't disagree more. Yes there are some that use liquor, but, not all of them use it. The liquor based ones that I have made were not strong to me, but they might be to someone that is sensitive. In my opinion, the alcohol cooks off in the cooking prosses, so what is left the the flavor of the liqour it's self.
I would suggest that you put a little more sugar in the filling or in the crust, if you like it sweet. Also, I like to put some brown sugar in the filling, even if the recipe does not call for it. It adds a wonderful rich color to the cakes
