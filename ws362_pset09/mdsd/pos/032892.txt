  "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader", By: C.S. Lewis is a great book so I choose to give it a four star rating.
  This book is a part of a very old and popular series of books about a magical land called Narnia.The book includes two of the four main characters from the first Narnia book called "The Lion the Witch" and the Wardrobe,Lucy and Edmund Pevensie.The other Pevensies,Peter and Susan were away at school and in America.It also reveals a new character who isn't the pleasantest person in the world,Eustace Clarence Scrubb,a cousin of the Pevensies.The Pevensies and Eustace were sucked into Narnia through a not well-liked painting hung in Eustace's house while they were staying there over the summer.They ended up in the salty sea where a ship which held the current king of Narnia,Prince Caspian and many other colorful characters.One,the captain of the ship,Drinian who though very pessimistic, a great sailor.
  The book contains many discoveries and strange islands.The ship encounters many odd creatures like dufflepods and ancient dragons.Some of the islands were uninhabited and some were cursed.The adventures were in search of seven lords who had been lost years before the setting of the book in a very devastating trip to find the place where the creator of Narnia,the great lion Aslan,was supposed to have lived.On the way they meet wizards,monsters,dreams,and even mermaids to find the lords.The greatest thing about the sail was that the lazy,cowardly,and nagging Eustace became a more thankful and nice person.
  Other titles I love are "Wringer","The Giver",and all of the other great additions to "The Chronicles of Narnia" series.I love Mystery and Fantasy books and these books are a great mix of both.
