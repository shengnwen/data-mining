What a true joy this book was to read!  True romance does exist! Mr. Kluger is very talented - creating such real, human characters with a totally addictive story through narratives, letters, checklists etc.
This big is a rare surprise.  It will make you laugh and cry as well.  Thogh it's a gay romance the book is a must read for any romantic at heart. Please Steve - write another book of fiction.  You brought life to my heart! Thanks!
