Susan Thorton wakes up--allegedly following a car accident--with partial amnesia, notably a big black hole of dread  surrounding her work as a scientist .  Susan can, however, recall the distant past such as the House of Thunder: a cave where she witnessed her boyfriend's hazing death by multiple murderers in college. 

The past has come back to haunt Susan Thorton.   Even the now-dead murderer has made his presence known to her.  Fortunately, she has a burgeoning friendship starting with her handsome doctor to help her through the confusion and hallucinations supposedly caused by a bruised brain.  

You'll be ripping through the pages with the energy of thunder.  This novel is suspenseful to the end where all of the elements unexpectedly fall into perfect place.  I had no idea how this novel would end, but I sure was loosing sleep to find out!  Highly recommended for anyone who has ever doubted their sanity... or just enjoys  a great mystery.
