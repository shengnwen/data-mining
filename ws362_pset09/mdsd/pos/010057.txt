There are those parents who buy bulk foods at the health food store and thoughtfully plan a variety of nutritious meals for their vegetarian children every day.  Then there is me, who considers herself a candidate for mother of the year if she manages to feed her child spaghetti for supper, rather than peanut butter and jelly.  This book helps.  It is filled with nutritious, creative recipes that please adults as well as children.  For the most part, the recipes have simple ingredients and are quick and easy to prepare, although the book does contain some more time-consuming recipes, such as Mama Palma's Pizza, that would be strictly weekend endeavors at my house.  My favorite of the recipes I tried was the Razz-Matazz-Berry Salad.  Mario's Stuffed Shells were a big hit with my husband and 18-month-old son, and my son and I really liked French Toast of the Town (try it with the maple glazed bananas). The book begins with a section called "A Healthy Approach to Feeding Our Families," which contains information about food and water safety, basic necessities of a vegetarian kitchen, and food allergies. It also has menu and party planning sections and a helpful section on nutritional requirements and food values.  However, the bulk of the book is recipes, all of which are vegetarian and most of which are vegan (there is honey in a few of the recipes). This book would be a godsend to any parent who needs new ideas for imaginative, nutritious vegetarian meals, when peanut butter and jelly just doesn't cut it anymore. -Reviewed by Susannah Rui
