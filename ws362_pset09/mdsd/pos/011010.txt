Wow, what a lot of bitter reviewers we have out there! Hey, it's Billy Collins, people, not T.S. Eliot.  Let's face it; there are three basic schools of poetry out there right now and they often cannot stand one another:  The brainy yet pretentious language poets; the studiously casual and often prosey Collins' types; and the, god-bless-'em, neo-formalists.  Each has its own champs and failures, and BAP has had editors from each camp at one point or the other.  Read this anthology and make up your own mind.  Pay special attention to the work of Gaylord Brewer and Terrance Hayes. And please, breathe deeply and visualize a happy place . .
