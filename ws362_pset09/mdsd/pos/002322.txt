This book has a lot of informations on what to eat and what to avoid based on your blood types.... I have just speed read through it once, but I am going to reread it again...it does make a lot of sense about my blood type though..like what food I am supposed to avoid...I find the info quite useful..if you are new to the blood type diet as I am, you might want to try to borrow this book from your local library first before you buy it...a book worth reading.
