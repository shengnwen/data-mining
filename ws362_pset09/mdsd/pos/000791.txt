Without a doubt, this is the best hospitality/humor/cookbook of the year.  While not a "joke cookbook," recipes such as "Gerri's Chilled Fruit" are hilarious.  And while not a "conventional" cookbook, Amy Sedaris's lovely vanilla cupcake recipe is perfect--a batch of them are cooling on my kitchen counter as I write.  The illustrations by Justin Theroux and others, along with the 1970s-crafty feel, as well as the characteristic photos of Amy Sedaris, make this book worthy of flipping through again and again.  And any reader of Amy's brother David will appreciate the links between her descriptions and his writings.  If you don't fully enjoy this book, you are a robot.  A million stars for this book
