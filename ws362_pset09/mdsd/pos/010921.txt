The best part about this book is that the heroine recognizes that the hero should find her unforgivable.  The fact that the hero so quickly lets go of his anger streamlined the plot, but didn't seem true to his phsyche and behavior.  The characters are well drawn.  The combination of political and economic interaction is believable.  But what I wouldn't give to find a morally ambivalent soul who's not a billionaire....
