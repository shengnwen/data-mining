The author travels to Sicily, Venice and other Italian areas, while continuing the reconstruction of the vintage Tuscan house.  Her descriptions of sites and food, once again lures the reader into thoughts of a trip to Italy.
If I had to choose between her two books, Under the Tuscan Sun would be my favorite, but this one is close in character.  She has a way with descriptions of places and people that truly starts one to hungering for the sounds and tastes of country life.  A number of recipes are sprinkled throughout the book, so the reader can try first-hand Paolo's Fennel Fritters or Sea Bass in a Salt Crust.
Besides the travel, people and food, the book details the restoration of the gardens in the centuries-old villa.  Luxuriate in the Tuscan experience through the eyes and words of Frances Mayes
