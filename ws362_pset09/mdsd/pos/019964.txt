What can you say a classic book on IPng. The text is very comprehensive covering the basics of IP networking through to the more obtruse concepts behind the Next Generation IP protocols.  The text is incredibly well written and mind  blowingly easy to understand, whilst holding the interest of all readers. My Fiancee was reading  over my shoulder, whilst I was sitting on the plane and consdiering she has little knowledge about networking picked up a lot from the few pages she read. This is a must for anyone interested in how the internet will survive the explosion of new systems hitting it and how the protocols that let us all communicate over it work
