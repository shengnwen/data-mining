T.M. Devine's account of Scotland from 1700-2000 is the most up-to-date review of Scottish history over the past three centuries.  Mr. Devine covers every aspect of the development of Scotland and Scottish life over that time period.  On many topics such as religion, immigration/emigration, government, cultural traditions, economics, and much more, Mr. Devine presents a thorough analysis.  I was hoping for more details on Adam Smith, David Hume and other figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, but Mr. Devine chooses to stick with the story of Scotland as a whole for this work.  This is a slow read at times, but for those genuinely interested in knowing more about the modern history of Scotland, this book has to be as good as one will find
