I really liked this book for many reasons. It was an easy read and it was clear, concise and specific. It can be read by people at various levels in their personal growth path and spiritual awareness. It is a step by step guide in learning how to tune into one's intuition, probably the most important skill we all need. It urges us all to be gentle and compassionate with ourselves and gives many examples of how this can be done using many different sensory modalities (such as visualizations, bodily sensations, thoughts) and the power of intention. The book encourages the reader to go inside and trust one's innermost wishes and desires. There are wonderfully
simple but powerful rituals and ceremonies that help the reader get in touch with her vision for herself and how to manifest her goals. Kudos to the author for giving us such a gem of a book.
