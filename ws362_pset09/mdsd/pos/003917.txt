I've read the reviews that some other people have written, and they say this book is very off topic and has a lot of selfishness in the characters, and that the events taking place in the tribulation don't happen the way they are supposed to.  HELLO PEOPLE, this is a FICTION book.  I'm not saying the events that the scriptures say will happen aren't going to happen, because the Rapture will occur some day.  I'm saying if Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins wrote a story ONLY on the scriptures and no characters or settings or anything in the story, the story would be way shorter and not as suspenseful.  Because when the Anti-Christ gets assassinated, there can be hundreds, maybe thousands of ways that could happen.  So when you people say everything in this book is a bunch of garbage, remember this is a STORY.
