It strikes me that Walsch's last few books have stemmed more from Walsch's ego than from God's Spirit. His first book `Conversations With God Book 1' was a feast for the soul, in my view, but these later books, particularly those written in the last 5 years, seem to be more of an expression of Walsch's impatience and irritability than inspired wisdom. 

Humanity is still in its childhood, in terms of spiritual growth, yet the way Walsch attacks certain views and beliefs, like the quote from Al Gore near the beginning of the book, is a bit like attacking a three-year old for dribbling food down its chin. The popular mind will grow into a more mature view in good time, and in turn will adopt wiser philosophies and will begin to behave more like adults. But in the meantime, the 'enlightened few' can cultivate a bit of patience, can relax, and can accept that the popular mind's views are presently somewhat unenlightened, without feeling the need to attack them or get irritated by them. 

There's room for growth for Walsch, for sure, just as we all have room for growth. We are all 'where we are' on the path, just as Al Gore is 'where he is' on the path. The more we can accept the way things are, without judging or feeling irritated, the more inner peace we will experience, regardless of external conditions and regardless of other people's views or opinions. 

In my view, Walsch said everything he needed to say in his first book, and his later books are getting somewhat tired
