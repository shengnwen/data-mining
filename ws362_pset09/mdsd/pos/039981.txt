I really enjoyed the book - read it through once underlined points to remember. Now I am going back and reading again the highlights. I like it even better, the second time through. Miss Jones' writing show passion. A man or woman, anybody who acts on the truths in this book will see change. That's what Coaching is about, Forward Change, not dwelling on the past, but learning, not dwelling in it. I am a man and enjoyed it greatly
