At a time when so many of us want to know and need to know more about the Middle East, this book is an essential read. The writer has the keen eye of a reporter as he brings readers along a pilgrimage through the modern Middle East, a path that leads to new understanding of the issues that shape this land. Whether you are Christian, Muslim, or Jewish, this book is a refreshing way to look at this ancient land. With beautiful writing and a sure understanding of history, Sennott takes readers on a journey along the path of Jesus' life.... I can't recommend this book enough
