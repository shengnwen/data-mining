It has been stated that the majority of people creating maps today have little in the way of formal cartographic education or background. If this statement is true, then this is the ideal reference book for developers assigned the task of building web-based mapping applications.

Although the Web Application Design Handbook is much more than a guide for developing interactive maps, its chapters on mapping will be especially helpful to developers who need to understand when to use geographic maps and how best to accomplish that. Beginning with basic map design concepts such as data formats, appropriate use of colour, scale, projection and dealing with map error; the authors then give the reader something further to consider while looking at the various uses of spatial statistics and discussing data classification and geographic distribution methods. This section then concludes with examples of various types of maps and how each can be used, which if nothing else, should serve to get a developer's creative juices flowing.     

Overall this should be an excellent reference for anyone designing and developing web-based applications, and as such, developers would be well advised to make sure they always have their own personal copy handy.
