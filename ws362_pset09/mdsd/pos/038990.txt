Hightly Recommended!  Like her previous book, Fad Surfing in the Boardroom, Eileen Shapiro cuts through the detrious of trends, fads and the latest management quick fix, to focus in on the essence of  practical,common-sense management.  Granted the cutesy &quot;seven  deadly&quot; aspect of the title and dustcover, Shairo immediately cuts to  the chase to address serious blindspots regarding strategic planning,  communication, personnel management, etc.  Replacing almost any other  management book on your bookshelf with this one will increase their overall  contribution to your management insight and performance
