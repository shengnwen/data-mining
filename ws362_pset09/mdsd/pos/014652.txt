This is one good training book. Lots of good information because mules are different from horses. I've used this book over and over especially good for people new to mule ownership or those who are breeding mules from their  favorite mares. I wish I had read it before my mule was born it might have  saved me from making some mistakes. Easy to read and full of good training  tips
