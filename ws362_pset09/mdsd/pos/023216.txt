This is a thoughtful and amazing book. In this amazing book, "War and the Soul: Healing Our Nation's Veterans from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder," psychologist Tick discusses how modern war affects the psyches of the human beings -- no matter how strong and resilient-- who fight them and how healing happen.

He recognizes the fact that wars are soul-wounding and that the healing is more than pills or pushing the memories away. He prescribes mythic storytelling, Native American ceremony and the involvement of the communityt to repair the wounds so that the veteran can once again feel "home" after immersed in the horror of war.

He has much to say how older veterans have a role in healing younger veterans and how the community and clergy can respond in healing ways. In Racine, Wis., I am very proud to sponsor his informational programs and healing retreats at Lake House Health & Learning Center. 

Thank you, Ed, for your brilliant and sincere work
