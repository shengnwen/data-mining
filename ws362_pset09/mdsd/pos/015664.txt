Good gods, how French women needed the feminism De Beauvoir sought to bring them.  I wish I didn't sometimes think they still did.... 

When Monique in the title story reflects that she should have known her marriage was on the skids when her husband told her she should buy a one-piece bathing suit, she immediatley reflects guiltily that she has let her thighs get fat, that her stomach is no longer completely flat... If I were Monique, I might reflect that it was a missed chance to craquer cher Maurice on the head with a deckchair.  

Instead, Monique  immediately stops eating (quelle surpise) and the first thing her estranged daughter says to her is that her resulting weight loss suits her.  It's no wonder that after fifteen years of this, Monique is gimpless when Maurice starts an affair with a younger woman.  

Sans doute, de Beauvoir was attempting a critique of such overmastering dependency, but it's also very, very raw-feeling.  The price paid by those chic women for thier polish and beauty is this overpowering, constant self-scrutiny; no wonder existentialism, no wonder a modern book like Thornytorinx (in case you think the problem is solved).  

This is powerful, true stuff, then, which reminded me of some of Dorothy Parker's best stories (without the humour) but I also felt irrtated with the spineless protagonists of all three stories.  Don't be so needy, I wanted to scream.  Go to a bar.  Go to a jardin.  Go to a boulanger.  Live a little, before you finally die.  In other words, the book feels not so much dated as in need of contestation.  I would have enjoyed it more if another character had voiced the limitations of the protagonists' viewpoints.
