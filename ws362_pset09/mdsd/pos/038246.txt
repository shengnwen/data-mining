Erna Paris has produced an excellent summary of the current  understanding of the way people in various socieities use memory to come to terms with past traumas.  She addresses memories of historical wrongs in Germany, France, Japan, South Africa and the United States.  She takes off from the abundant current literature on how societies remember.  Her princicpal contribution, however, are the many interviews she conducted in the various countries under consideration.  She has an excellent eye for the telling detail and the dramaitc quote.  This is one of the most accessbile books on memory and justice I have read
