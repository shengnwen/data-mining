A mesmerising book, Hopkirk writes with a flair and passion that is infectious.  The stories told by Hopkirk in 'Foreign Devils on the Silk Road' read like they belong in an Indiana Jones movie:  Russian, French,  Chinese, British and even Swedish(!) adventurers - heroes and villans both  - competing to find the treasures of legendary cities buried for centuries  beneath the trecherous sands of the Taklamakan desert.  Exotic locations  (still largely unknown to the Western world), rumours of supernatural  forces protecting the buried cities - even the Indiana Jones-esque link to  early Christian sects (the Nestorians) - it's all there!  But it's more  than just a &quot;boy's own&quot; adventure story: Hopkirk provides  fascinating insights into the history of the ancient Silk Road as well as  its latter intersection with the Great Game.
