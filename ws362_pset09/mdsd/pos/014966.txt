I bought this book for my daughter who's going to school next fall and for my son who's already at school this year - and they both loved it and thanked me!! The guide is filled with so many great pieces of advice, from the students themselves, and it covers every topic I could think of regarding freshman year. Parents of college-bound students: this is a perfect graduation or back-to-school gift
