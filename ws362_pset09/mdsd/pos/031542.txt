I cook for 6-24 people at a time, for casual to black tie formal occasions, and this book has beautiful and tasty recipes that have always gotten requests for "What is the recipe", or Is this easy to make?"      I do not have a lot of time to prepare complex recipes, so this book's numerous offerings, with usually readily obtainable ingredients suit me just fine! 

 My final appetizer is often slightly adapted from the book's recipes, my changes based on substituting local fresh herbs, fish for meat, or other seasonal or tropical substitutions.

Recipes such as the "Filo tartlets with spicy cilantro shrimp and Thai red chili dipping sauce" are quick to make, and stand out above other more "conventional" appetizers, and can be used without the tartlets, even on toast, to keep it easy. This and other appetizers have gotten rave reviews-if you prepare this, be warned that some guests may fill up on this alone, and not have room left for the entree and dessert!   

Worried about not having an item...then for example, substitute sour cream for creme fraiche if it's not available for a different recipe, and it's no less tasty!

There's a mix of easy creations, and some more formal ones as well in this beautiful book. 

The hints on preparation, and the pictures are inspirational to create numerous variations, so you get several hundred recipes from this beautiful book.

I need quick, easy and tasty for my uses, and cooking from this book has provided just that. See also "The Appetizer Atlas : A World of Small Bites" by Arthur L. Meyer for more complex and varied appetizers.

Buy this book, cook from it, and enjoy the smiles of your family, friends and guests
