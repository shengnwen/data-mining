I'm not going to go over the plot of the novel since others have already done that. Having said that, let me also say that Mr. Yates' storytelling style is the best I have encountered in a long time. There were several points in the novel where I stopped and said, "Wait a minute. I gotta read that again. I can't believe he [Yates] did that," simply because he kept dropping little bombshells. Meanwhile, from the very beginning, Mr. Yates lights a fuse that burns through the entire novel as he reveals the true nature of Nathan's and Tommy's relationship. I'm not referring to the most obvious aspect of their relationship (which you can read about yourself), but to Tommy's longstanding ability to exert a positive influence on Nathan's behavior by both word and deed, in spite of appearing to be just a pretty-boy who doesn't give much thought to the possible consequences of his actions. At the same time, Nathan seems to have little or no ability to influence Tommy's behavior, no matter how hard he tries or how morally superior he believes himself to be. 

I don't want to tell you anything else; you need to experience this novel in full. Just buy the book, OK? Don't forget to get overnight shipping.
