Dances with wolves is one of my favourite movies ever. Once you see the movie as many times as I've seen it :) you try to find something else to continue the story. The ilustrated story of the epic brings you back to the movie and has very nice photos and comments of several scenes. I reccomend it to any fan of the movie
