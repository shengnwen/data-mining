I thought this book was hilarious because the little kid Brad Kills himself ridin his bike into a parked ambulance. But I didnt like the way the author wants you to think about the book, he wants you to be like sad for the little kid. Also he didnt use very descriptive words. Like he doesnt describe the characters enough. out of five, I give it a four
