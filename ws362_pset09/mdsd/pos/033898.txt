Have you ever wondered why or what certain amendments mean?  The title "Constitution Translated for Kids", says it all.   This wonderfully written book takes what the constitution says and makes it easier to understand.  Cathy Travis has done a superb job.

"The Constitution endures, through each President and each Congress. Elected officials are with us for a term but the Constitution is the foundation of all the laws in our country.  No document supersedes the Constitution.  Few people truly understand that fact.  The language of the time this precious document was written makes it difficult to understand."

"This document created the most successful system of government known to people in the last two centuries, despite the human frailties of office holders and citizens...despite their emotions, doubts, fears, greed, anger, indecision or bad decisions from time to time.  The enduring magic of the Constitution is in the ideas this nation represents.  Our independence was forged in the belief that our common pursuit of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness would successfully govern a nation for the ages.  The Constitution enshrines this philosophy."

Ms Travis has included a glossary of terms in the back of this book.  On one side of the page are the actual words of the constitution on the other side is the Constitution in words that are easier to understand.  A timeline is included in the front of the book.  Through out the book there are Fast Facts, interesting facts about the Constitution.

This book was written for children however; it would be appropriate for adults also. Too many times we hear people attempting to quote or interpret the Constitution without knowing what it truly says or means.  

From the moment I opened this book I was hooked.  This is a must for school libraries and classrooms.  Thank you Ms Travis for educating us to what the U.S. Constitution means.
