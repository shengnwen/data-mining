Black Cats grabbed my attention from the start with the story of Violett's rather difficult trip into adulthood.    I was instantly intrigued by the world created by Ms. Doll.  Most of the story takes place in a small town where decorations on umbrellas denote social cliques and gods have dinner parties.  The book quickly gets interesting as Violett's attraction to a mysterious man pulls her into a life that is both exhilarating and devastating.  By the end of it I'm not sure if she would have been better off never having known him, but maybe she didn't have that choice.  
The story is told with a refreshing writing style.  It's not blunt, and occasionally somewhat abstract.  I just wish it hadn't ended, so I could stay in the world a little longer.
