I am taking Mr. Levack's classat UT, and of course this book is required reading. Regardless I would probably have gotten the book sooner or later. It is AMAZING. Extremely detailed, delves into both the magical and legal proceedings on the Witch hunt. The focus is on WHY something like this happened, and I feel Mr. Levack is incredibly inciteful in his ideas
