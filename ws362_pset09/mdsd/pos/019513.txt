Alan Moorehead's complete history of the Russian Revolution puts much in context. It is packed full of information and emotional scenes. Yet, since revolutions tend to be chaotic events by nature, it is hard to analyze them  (though many have claimed to have succeeded to do so). The two decades that  the book covers was an eventful one, and Moorehead goes through the phases  in orderly, chronological order. Unfortunately, the cumbersome load of  names of people, councils, and various crises makes the book a little hard  to follow (not exactly a &quot;Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;).  However, Moorehead discloses much information cut out of most textbooks and  narratives of the Russian Revolution such as the true founder of Communism.  It is a great complement to any textbook on European history, but one must  not try to overload one's memory banks. Enjoy
