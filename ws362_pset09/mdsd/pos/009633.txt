This is a terrific book on homology theory, covering all the standard topics, plus some nice topics that are hard to find in other introductory books. The motivation for theory is presented in both algebraic/categorical and geometric flavors. The structure of the book is mostly solid, getting straight to the point with singular homology instead of wasting time with simplicial homology and its results (a rarity with algebraic topology books). My only complaints are that the book is riddled with typos and chapter 5 (on products in homology and cohomology) is quite messy
