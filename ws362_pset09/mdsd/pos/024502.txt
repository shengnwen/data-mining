Danielle Steele is a master artist at slowly piecing a book together, such as one of her better novels, The Cottage.  This book consists of amazing characters that are split from the lives they once knew, and later are puzzled back together for a friendly meeting.  Each main character, Jimmy, Mark, and Coop, are so different in their personalities but yet so much alike in their experiences.  They cry, laugh, and just simply have fun when they are finally together.  These three men share many similar situations throughout the novel and in the end, they all meet and talk about those certain happenings in each of their lives.  How woman have left, cheated, and even passed away but they dealt with it and moved on.  Luckily, they all found each other in their differences and similarities to be best friends.  The capturing way Steele writes activates your emotions and slams your reality-way of thinking.  She has a &quot;happily-ever-after&quot; touch to her writing and it takes your breathe away.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this selection and would reccomend it to anyone!  Danielle Steele is truly a romantic genius
