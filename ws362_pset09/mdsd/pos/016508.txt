I got this book thinking I would detest it, but wanted to see what the hype was.  It turned out that I actually liked the book, even though it has some very negative aspects to it.  On the positive side, the first part of the book was gripping and very well written.  The family members are well portrayed; Annie is immediately a very dislikable person and remains so throughout.  Although the premise is kinda silly, trying to find a man who can "psychologically heal" horses, it actually comes across much more sensibly than I thought it would.  Tom, the healer is basically a likeable person who seems pretty genuine.  All is well until Annie, the daughter, and Tom meet in Montana.  Then the book starts going downhill.  The myth of a healing adulterous relationship and the graphic sex scenes are not touching and thoughtful to me.  I found it disgusting and illogical for this professional, hard nosed woman to allow  herself to become pregnant like a teenager in love after sneaking around on her husband.  The book could have eliminated these details and been much better.  The horses in this book had more sense than some of the main characters
