  This book was great....refreshingly different even tho
  it's content centered around the old subject of sex...
  at least this one was amusing...I enjoyed Red Shoe Diaries..
  Memoirs of a Geisha...and the fairly new Dance to Despair
  Memoirs of an Exotic Dancer) by Rebeckka Sathan Black 
  floored me...I could not put that book down either..
