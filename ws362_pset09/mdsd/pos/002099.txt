Definitely, an excellent introductory book on video compressionfundamentals. The book is very well written in a simple and clearway. It explains the basics of audio, image and video compression techniques, with a minimum of math. However, you won't find detailed implementation issues, and it has some mismatches in the examples and in the formulas used. If you know nothing or little about video compression and you don't want to mess with complicated math, this is the book you should read
