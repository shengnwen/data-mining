Simply an outstanding book.  Peter Nabakov has collected an impressive array of first-hand testimonials of Native people in one readable and very important volume.  Chapters range from prophecies of various Peoples  stretching thousands of years before European contact to responses and  testimonies of Native people today.  Many books in this vein focus on  historical 'quotable quotes,' whereas this book is far greater in both  depth and breadth.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in Native  Peoples, Native histories and Native issues
