I liked the subject matter of both this book & The Making of a Chef, but, as other reviewers have previously mentioned, these books are plagued by seriously flawed editing. Repetition abounds, as does typographical, syntactic and basic research errors. In Ruhlman's quest for perfection in cooking, he looks as if he abandoned this ideal in his writing. I really wanted to like these books but those mistakes became increasingly more annoying as time went on
