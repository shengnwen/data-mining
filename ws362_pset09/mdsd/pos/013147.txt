I enjoyed this book. I like that a chapter is designated for each person such as: Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, just to name a few. The facts that are listed in each chapter is fascinating and despicable. Hillary Clinton is a down right thief! I remember hearing about her "taking" things from the White House when they moved out, but at that time in my life didn't have time to concern myself with politics. The Kennedy family has always disgusted me and after reading the chapter on Ted Kennedy and how his family protects their money at the expense of others made me ill. The people in this book are lacking ethics to say the least.
This is a book that people should read regardless of your political view point. It is an eye opener that is for sure
