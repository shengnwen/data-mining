With smooth moves across the literary dance floor, author Raymond Chandler has his way with his partner, the fortunate reader. Without a word too much or too little, Chandler created a style both casual and elegant. His lead character in this work, private detective Phillip Marlowe, must solve a murder, one that is connected to  gambling, beautiful women, guns and danger. If you like the sleek style of the 1930's or 40's, then this writer is probably the one for you.

   "Let's talk a little first."
   "About what? Oh...my jade?"
   "About murder."
