I did like this book alot. Yes, I will admit, the "southern" dialect was more black gullah talk than old white blood, and it did get a little bit annoying. However, I really enjoyed this one and Isle of Palms much better than Sullivan's Island and Pawleys Island.
Some of these reviews are SO harsh. Repressed anger, maybe
