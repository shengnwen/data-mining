MISERY----5 STARS

When reading this book, I could not put it down.....i LOVED every single page of this book, I really enjoyed it....it was INTENSE, SAD, and FUNNY....What this poor guy Paul Sheldon goes thru is absolutely unimaginable. I cannot believe it......I feel so bad for this guy....how he adapts to living the way he was forced to, by this psycho crazy [...] by the name of, Annie Wilkes....UNREAL.....go out and pick this one up....like I said before, I couldn't put it down. It took me 2 days to finish it, and I did not speed read it, I TRULY enjoyed it, and was very disappointed when it was over. I am currently reading "IT" and I will review that one when I have finished....GO PICK UP MISERY!!!!
