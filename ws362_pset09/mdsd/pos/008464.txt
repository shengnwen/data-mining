Serving Crazy With Curry easily qualifies as one of my favorite books, ever. Being in my mid-twenties, I can very easily identify with the way Devi feels, believing her life's not worth living, and she should just take the easy way out. When her mother saves her, Devi goes silent and expresses her frustration through Indian cooking, but with strange ingredients. 

Not only can one easily identify with the main character, you see characters who are Indian-American struggle in being more Indian, or more American. Grandmother, mother, and daughter; who knew their lives would be so complex? 

I highly recommend this book to anyone
