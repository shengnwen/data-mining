Alan Booth has the most wonderful way of making the reader feel his triumphs and sorrows.  His writing style gives the book a very "visceral" feeling and it is easy to get lost in the book.  This is added to by the authors bluntness.  He never seems to be glossing over the truth.  He openly talks about the good and bad that is done to him, and by him.
 
I read alot of this book while I spent my mornings in a Mister Donut in Asakusa during my trip to Tokyo for a photo shoot.  The book really helped get my creative juices flowing and made me want to return to Japan to shoot along it "backside."  It also made me realize the dangers of eating vindictive carp.

I would highly recomend this book to anyone thinking of traveling in Japan, or to someone who just likes to let their wings stretch in a good book.
