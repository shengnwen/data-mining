Paul Stiles's "Is the American Dream Killing You?" is a caustic, provocative polemnic against what he regards as the worst excesses of American capitalism. He depicts "The Market" as a soulless, amoral entity, that is grinding away the best attributes of American culture and society; namely individualism and personal liberty for the sole sake of generating as much profit as possible, whatever the ultimate social and personal cost to those engaging in the pursuit of maximizing profit. He describes forcefully how "The Market" is destroying the traditional American family, forcing people to work longer and longer hours, at the expense of providing genuine familial care to their children and fellow adult siblings. He also notes how pernicious "The Market" has been in our feeble attempts in resolving the prospect of uncontrolled global warming - in stark contrast to what can be done now to control the most adverse effects of raising the Earth's surface temperature by a few degrees Celsius over the course of this century. Sounding somewhat naive, I think, Stiles urges us to return to our core basic beliefs, emphasizing the importance of strong religious faith as an important glue to the tattered fabric that is now American society. As someone trained in evolutionary biology, I also take issue with his misappropriation of Darwin's Theory of Evolution via Natural Selection, seemingly conflating it with Social Darwinism; itself an illegitimate intellectual offspring of Darwin's work, which Darwin himself soundly rejected, since he harbored a more liberal view of humanity than what proponents of Social Darwinism were advocating in Victorian Britain
