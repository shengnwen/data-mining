I loved this book. I Liked the various personalities of the characters in this book. However, I could do without the extra explanation at the end of each story. The author did a great job helping explain each situation very well, but she tends to go on and on about the subject at the end of each story. Kinda buggs me. I liked that each story was a little different and it made me mad how each state treated these adopted parents. Each story is different , with its own different successes. Thats why I like it so much.
