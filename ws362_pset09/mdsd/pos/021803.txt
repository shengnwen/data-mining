THE STANLEY PLANE by Alvin Sellens is a true American Classic for all Stanley plane collectors but also for vintage and antique american books collectors as well. The three hundreds plus illustrations are a real visual feast.

I DO NOTE that ... The 2006 recipient of the EARLY AMERICAN INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION, Inc. (EAIA) J.D. Hatch Award is Alvin Sellens. 

"In 1993 (J.D. Hatch, a long-time member and former secretary/treasurer, editor of the Chronicle, and president of the EAIA) presented EAIA with an engraved plane to be awarded on a rotating basis to those individuals who should be recognized for "excellence in the advancement of general understanding of early American industries through scholarly excellence in writing or display materials relating to EAIA"  (Quoted from The Chronicle of the Early American Industries Association, Inc. May/Jun 2006)

Sellens handsomely delivers the STANLEY goods to his readers with a detailed inventory of all the handplanes manufactured by The Stanley Works. A brief but important survey of this toolmakers and their genius at marketing and promotion makes this book as important an historical research manual as the wonderfull and comprehensive inventory of hand planes. 

This book also doubles as a very practical in-the-field manual for collectors who attends country auctions, flea markets and yard sales. You will find an informative list of 106 bibliographical REFERENCES (pp 203-206) and a usefull CROSS REFERENCE INDEX from page 207 to 216
