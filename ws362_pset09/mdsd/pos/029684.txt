This novel has a wonderfully unique premise. The themes of the darker aspects of Greek Myth, sinister woods and what lurks within them, unreality right beneath our world, make for a delightfull story. While the plot is a  bit mundane towards the center of the book, overall this is compensated  for. If you've ever let your mind wander into the origins of ancient myths,  and have been a bit shocked by what you imagine this is the book for you.  The sexual aspect of the supernatural events is key, and overall adds to  the one's attraction and repulsion to the concepts beneath the surface of  this book. Machen was akcknowledged by HP Lovecraft as a major influence,  and one sees this here. Also, Spare's illustrations, while not done for the  book, are quite appropriate to convey its themes. Highly reccomended
