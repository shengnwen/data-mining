I used to own a bookstore and when people would ask me my favorite book, I always named "Middlemarch."  In my opinion, this is the greatest book written.  George Eliot was a towering intellect and a masterful observer of humanity.  Sure, you have to really focus on this book while you're reading it, but it's worth it.  Dickens was a piker compared to Mary Anne Evans (the author's real name).  Make the time to read this novel someday (along with Moby Dick, Ulysses and War & Peace)
