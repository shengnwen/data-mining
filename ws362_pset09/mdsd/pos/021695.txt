The author deserves credit for weaving together a character Joe Pitt, who is a combination of Humphrey Bogart, Harrison Ford, and...well, name your favorite vampire.

What I enjoyed about the book was the question of what it means to live, and what it means to die, as brought out by a clan of ascetic vampyres who gain super powers by remaining on the verge of death.  Then, the plot brings about those same kinds of powers in our hero.

I am somewhat averse, though, to novels in which some mastermind seems to know exactly what the protagonist will do and when he'll do it, so that all things fall together just exactly as they were "supposed to."  This happens with the leader of the Enclave in this book, and it takes away from the balance of the novel
