. . . let it be &quot;A Path With Heart!&quot;   With wise and skillful words, Jack Kornfield is a master of teaching Buddhist practices including insight meditation (known as vipassanna) to Western students for over 20  years. Being a former Buddhist monk with a PHD in psychology,  as well as a  husband and father, he is able to communicate the practice of Buddhism in  everyday life in a way that makes sense to Western minds. Kornfield  embraces the stuggles and hindrances that are common to the spiritual path  as well as offering timely and useful meditations for awakening, opening  the heart and clear and humorous insight into basic Buddhist principles  such as the 5 precepts, the Buddhist view of self (or lack thereof) and  karma.  With open arms and a deep understanding of the Western psyche and  it's tangles, Kornfield delivers a book that is a love song, a workout and  a survival manual for anyone committed to the spiritual path
