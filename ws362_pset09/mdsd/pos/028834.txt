Upon finishing this book (and during the duration of reading it), I found myself even more disconnected and lonely than I have become accustomed to over the years.  It was a strange experience because in retrospect of what I just read the night before of the first three sections, I could not pinpoint what it was that had so drastically changed my outlook and demeanor on the present night.  People noticed a difference in me, asked if I was tired or feeling okay.  Then, as if it all came together, I realized that I was mirroring exactly what it is Dr. Peck explains in his musings on discipline and love.  I had encountered a truth in my life (and in life as a whole for that matter), and responded to it with a sense of solace and lack of drive.  I was reading something my consciousness did not want to address and thereby it left the world as I had known it just the day before starting this book forever changed and lost to me.  It was only when I moved into the forth and final section of the book which addresses the nature of God that the redeeming quality of the inevitability of life's suffering, which is the general theme of the work, became palpable to my sensibility.

Yet I've noticed a common theme of those who lack a set religion lambasting this book due to its obvious spirituality.  Perhaps my own story can diversify the response.  I myself follow no set institution of religion.  I have no concept of one religious philosophy as being superior to another yet still, the one thing that I will never be able to accept is the notion of the lack of a higher power.  Atheists like to fancy themselves intellectually superior, believing that by accepting only what they can see they somehow rise above the ranks, whereby in my opinion they meet the very contradiction of their philosophy.  The evidence of Spirit is all around us, echoed most poetically in the fact that we exist.  How is it possibly for us simple to be?  No purpose, no endgame, just here we are, nothing exists outside of this reality.  For my own humble perspective, that's more ludicrous than the notion that something outside of this reality has brought us forth and that this something has done so with benevolent intentions so that we may reflect on what it is to be and to know what it knows.  Having always struggled with issues of cosmic-inferiority, whereby I could not fathom how in a universe that knows no bounds where we are merely tiny little animals that inhabit a tiny little planet that orbits a star within a galaxy of billions we could be seen as something more than utterly unimportant and lost in the mass of all that is, this book's final section provided musings I've longed for for a very long time.  Of particular impact was Dr. Peck's assumption that if the universe is infact so vast and never-ending, then should we not by the mere fact that we exist and in a single lifetime may experience a million miracles, both small and large, that bring us ever closer to oneness with the Spirit, thereby see ourselves as the center of the universe, as somehow chosen and given as a gift the universe in all her mystery to use as our steppingstone for personal growth and ultimately the assumption of the role of God Him(or Her/Its)self.  It's borderline Ayn Rand Individualism, but from a much more humble and spiritual approach.  Obviously this book can't be everything for everyone, and there are for my taste minor missteps in the discussion of love (thus the missing star), yet still I will brave stepping right into the line of clichï¿½ by admitting that I can honestly say that this book has changed my life
