That may be slight hyperbole. Reading Stuart makes me start talking like Stuart. I think I may _be_ Stuart! This book works both as comedy and, well I'm not sure Al planned for this... as therapy too. I've actually found some strength from both the book and the movie. I'm not kidding. You'll find yourself laughing out loud in public (well, that is, if you read it in public) _and_ walking away feeling better about yourself. I'm not kidding
