As a nearly constant rule, I can count on reading and enjoying
a work based solely on the ink on the page and it's effect on
my mental processes and wanderings.
Not this time--Not this writer.
Between her knowledge of enough Science to make me want to
dig for more, and her Art, which will drive me to more of her work, it's probably best that we live on continentally-separated
coasts. I believe I would LOVE to know this person. I'm also
pretty sure that I could become an ambulatory poster boy
for the well-used cliche about Old Fools.
What a wonderful subject upon which to loose a mind of such
incredible sensuality. 
I'd recommend this book [and do] to anyone who retains even
the tiniest door open to curiousity and wonder.
I'm not even finished with the book...
I thought that it might slip off a bit at the end. Wrong again,
the next-to-last chapter, 'Synesthesia,' left me unable to continue highlighting passages...the notations extended past
paragraphs, past pages.
Just buy, read it...it's fourteen bucks you'll be glad
you traded for art.
