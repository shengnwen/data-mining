Our elder son Ian recieved this from his grandmom for x'mas, and hasn't stopped researching it ever since. Its 'grown up' enough for it to be full of facts and very well detailed, yet colorful and exciting and fresh enough for children to easily relate to. Do get it if you have a child who's passionate about animals. For others, I would wait till they can read, perhaps after 6 yrs age
