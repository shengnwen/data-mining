Raised Protestant by former Catholics, my view of religion has been a swirl of orthodoxy and free-thinking.  With no regrets, I was hooked into the fiction of Morris West.  Although "The Clowns of God," "The Tower of Babel," "Proteus," and others provided thrillers rich in theological and political ideas, nothing quite captured me in the way of my first encounter with "The Shoes of the Fisherman."

West was a writer of Old World elegance and, sometimes, stiffness.  His characters rarely spoke like actual people; they spoke like people trying to convey concepts that would be written down for the ages.  Although somewhat archaic, there was a grace and richness to this perspective that always left me satisfied.  In "The Shoes of the Fisherman," more than any other West novel, I was challenged with questions of what the true gospel of Jesus is all about, and the true purpose of ministry in a world of hurting people.  When the Pope decides to disguise himself so that he may enter the lives of normal people, we see an example of the Son of God coming to earth in the form of a man to touch human lives.  With characteristic beauty, using fictitious papal journal entries, West gives us glimpses into the mind of those called to serve God.

I, for one, miss the writing of Morris West and hope to one day see him on the other side.  Until then, I hope his books are not lost to future generations.  He has much to say that still applies to our modern world
