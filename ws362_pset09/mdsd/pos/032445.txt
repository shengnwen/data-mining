I love this book.  Bought it in Seattle when I started climbing 15 years ago.  Many of the routes are really not that crowded.  I spent days on end without seeing anyone on several of the routes.  WARNING though, earlier comments are right about innacuracy.  Abide by topos and trust your compasses -- or bring an extra day's food for some of the north facing routes described
