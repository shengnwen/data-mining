As a college senior, I didn't realize how similar colleges can be until I read this book and talked to friends at other schools. There are certainly differences between Stanford, Chicago, Harvard, and other top schools but there remain similarities. It seems that students generally aren't very focused on long-term relationships or the life of the mind, choosing instead to focus on building resumes and doing well for themselves. This isn't news, but what I liked about this book was how the author used great stories from his time at Harvard to flesh out that generalization of what students are like. As a college student, I liked this book because it rang true with my own experience. If you're older, you may like this book because it can give you a vivid picture of college life today. My only criticism is that I thought the book could have been tighter, which means that I wasn't particularly interested in everything the author had to say. But whether you end up captivated for all 300 pages or just briefly interested, I recommend taking a look
