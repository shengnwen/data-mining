Dr. Greene's book on Celiac disease is the absolute best on facts and understanding about the symptoms and far reaching results of Celiac disease. It answers questions as to childhood problems that I never associated with my problems. It gives medical terms and diagrams that I "slept through" in health class. It is must reading for anyone who may be suffering from an undiagnosed digestive condition or those under the care of a physician unfamiliar with Celiac disease. It clearly outline the proper tests needed, as well as the proper care that must ensue. We have shared this book with several "suspects", and they, too, have found it to be understandable and informative. Dr. Greene unveils much needed knowledge in his clear writing style.
