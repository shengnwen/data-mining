My uncle, who has been taking vitamins for years, recommended this book to me when I asked him for a single reference that would tell me about vitamins, minerals,EFAs, as well as some of the non vitamin/mineral supplements.  This book has it all and I love how it's layed out - for each item it gives a brief overview of what the vitamin etc is, lists the natural food sources which I was particularly interested in, gives the RDA, benefitial effects, and uses.  It goes into detail but not so much that you feel bogged down with info.  Just enough for me
