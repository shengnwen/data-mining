I find this CD a great accompanyment to the beginner class that I am currently taking. I am a complete novice in the Spanish language.  While the CD does present the course with much repetition and practice, it relies almost entirely on memorization, with little explanation of "why" a verb has a particular ending.  I find that some basic verb conjugation (from my class) helped me understand better in the memorization portions of this CD.  But, all in all, a good CD for use in the car.
