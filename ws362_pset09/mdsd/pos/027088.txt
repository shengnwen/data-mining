This is the history of German science and how it was perverted by Nazi ideology.  It begins with a review of what made Germany a leader is science in the 19th and early 20th century.  It then discusses how it was used and perverted to support the Nazi agenda.  

The subject of German science is an immense one, and this book only scratches the surface.  The early history of German science focuses on WWI, particularly with regards to poison gas and Fritz Haber.   Thus, early on, it raises the question of what moral obligation, if any, a scientist has towards the use of his science.  The answer appears to be that most scientists were more than willing to follow the dictates of their government, with little thought to the overall morality of what they were doing.  As Werner von Braun put it after the war, he did not care if he worked for Uncle Sam or Uncle Joe (Stalin), so long as he was a rich uncle.  This moral ambivalence is a main theme of the story and led, among other things, to many doctors disregarding their oath to save lives, but instead to end them in the name of racial purity.  It discusses how Nazi science contributed to the Holocaust and to the deaths of slave labores working to build the German synthetic gas and rocket plants. 

The book covers the dismissal of German Jewish scientists and which of their colleagues protested and which took this as the easy road to advancement.  The book discusses "Jewish Physics" and how this view of modern physics retarded the development of a German atomic bomb.  (Much of the later portion of the book deals with the German bomb project and whether or not Werner Heisenberg actively worked to prevent its development.)  Hitler's view of science is also discussed and shows how this retarded not only the development of a German bomb, but also (unfortunately only temporarily) the development of jet planes and rockets.  

This is an interesting book that raises many troubling questions.
