The strength of this book is its point of view.  Deemer presents himself as a screenwriting teacher who presents and evaluates many different appraoches to screenwriting, letting the reader choose what works.  In this  way, a great amount of information is presented in little space.  This book  is a quick and fun read and even inspiring.  I highly recommend it
