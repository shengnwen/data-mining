This book is groundbreaking: early 1970s fiction in which a psychological feedback loop determines the relationship between man and machine. Like Pynchon, Gibson, or Burroughs? This is like a popular fiction exploration of the same ideas, except infused with a small amount of Steven King scariness. As a concept, it is an excellent book. I found the characters more believable than those in most Crichton books, and more compassionately portrayed. Where it falls down as a popular book is the pacing of it. After a rush of initial discovery, we are warned of impending disaster, but the disaster happens in the small and is over quickly, leaving us with a talky and poignant but starkly empty conclusion. Crichton found out, as many authors do, that too many "current" technical details age poorly. If he updates the technology references in this book, and expands upon the terror wreaked by its situation (a hint, dear sir - one man's actions can influence others to do much more, especially if he's a genius), this book could be a contender among the popular fiction of today, as it hits on a vital topic and shows us the pathos of humanity in its grip. I would recommend this book to any reader of popular fiction who likes the theory behind computers, or human computers, something we commonly call "psychology.
