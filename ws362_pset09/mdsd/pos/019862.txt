This book was written very well and had a few challenges for me to work through.

I would definately recommend this book as a must read for families, those who work with kids, those who are thinking of working with kids. it truly does a great job of challenging you in how do you really value kids? Do you see them as valuable, one who christ died for? Do you see them as a tool to get to the parents? What about a bother? 

Maybe you already work with kids but you find yourself preparing for your time with them getting shorter and shorter. This is a tell discussed in the book that even as a full time childrens pastor of 15+ years I found myself challenging to think through
