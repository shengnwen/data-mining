"Creating Unforgettable Characters" succeeds in giving practical steps in the development of character.  The book covers several disciplines like psychology, acting, backstory and relationships in an effort to refine and inform the way you approach your characters.  For more experienced writers looking to drill down rewrites, the digestible 'get to the freakin' point' style of the book helps you get to what you need, instead of wasting your time lording over topics you don't give shlip about (if I could only take a minute of life away from every author who's wasted my time patting themselves on the back for their puddling observations... there'd be a lot of dead folks in LA).  

Particularly useful are the summarizations and categorical exercises at the end of each chapter, helping you immediately implement the lesson into your writing.  There are also frequent exercises throughout the book to help jog your mind in relation to your characters.

Seger gives special attention to minor, supporting and nonrealistic characters which populate every script, but are often neglected.  Seger's not asking for every character to be the central figure of your narrative... but they better be the central figure of their own story in some way.  The book helps in creating characters, small and large, that have a reason for being.  It's easy to neglect lesser characters, when they should be poignant and relevant.

Thankfully, Seger has the 'How' mentality that is missing from so many other books on writing.  If you are new to writing, this is an excellent resource for illuminating all the elements that go into making a fully fleshed out character.  If you're an experienced writer and are looking for a way to make your characters 'pop' off the page a bit more, "Creating Unforgettable Characters" could help you find that edge
