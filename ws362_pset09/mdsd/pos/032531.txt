The term "Red Zone" refers to the mode animals are in during the height of an attack where nothing can stop it.  Therefore the novel "Red Zone:  The Behind-the-Scenes Story of the San Francisco Dog Mauling" describes the actions leading up to and beyond the horrific attack on lacrosse coach Diane Whipple by two Presa Canario dogs.  A gripping tale covering the accounts behind all the people and organizations involved in obtaining the fighting dogs and the subsequent trial of the victim's neighboring owners, not a detailed history of the breed or the gangs.

Starting roughly seven years prior to the attack, the author compiles evidence behind how and when individuals met and their general background information, focusing the novel's first half on the mastermind behind an illegal dog-breeding program, inmate Paul Schneider.  The latter half includes the investigation and legal proceedings.  The events occur quickly while maintaining a storytelling atmosphere.

While understanding the profound motivations and psychology behind those being manipulated by Paul Schneider, better editing could have reduced the oftentimes-repeated facts and notably bias remarks.
