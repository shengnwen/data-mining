I was just wondering about the age of Luke Brandon from the first novel of the series, Confessions of a Shopaholic, and this second one, Shopaholic takes Manhattan.  In the first one, Luke is said to be "32 years old" and here, he's said to be "34 years old."  How can Luke age by 2 years when it has only been a gap of a few months between the first and second novels.  In addition, Becky's only 25 in the first one and 26 in this second one, so if there's only a 1 year leap for her, then why Luke has two? Can anyone answer this question for me?  I just simply don't understand.
