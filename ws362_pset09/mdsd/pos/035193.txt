This book gives a perspective of the culture into which Mary was conceived, born, lived and died. It certainly expanded my understanding of her and her special relationship with Jesus. The "downside" is the frequent references to absolute rejection of any pleasures of this world and life and the need to undergo unimaginable suffering while living here if one wishes to be seen by God as acceptable-a view apparently shared by the 4 mystics and Mary.
