I guess all the neo-literary, post-post-modern, pseudo-noir, Jonathan Franzen/Dave Eggers-type writers of this sad, sad world (to name just a few) should stop typing their inane "masterpieces" and crack open this very book. Maybe it wouldn't do 'em any good, but you never know.  "A Gin-Pissing..." reeks of truth and sweaty dreams, but with a sweet epiphany to boot. Dan Fante's novels (get 'em all) are mighty good, but that's his best
