The Jackie Daniels series combines a terrific plot along with just enough humour, police procedure, descriptions of places to keep the book even more interesting.  The author shares Jackie's personal life more in this book but not so much that this aspect takes over.  Like the previous books, the author has introduced the villain or situation involving the villain, fairly early in the book so it is necessary to read carefully.  A great second book and a hard book to put down
