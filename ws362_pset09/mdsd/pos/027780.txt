It's always hard to decide who is more famous, Steve Smallman, Sr, or Steve Smallman, Jr. . . . having said that, this book is a tremendous set of stories and studies about how God mysteriously moves in human lives to draw people to Himself.  It shows, through winsome narratives, how God gently works in the inner places of human hearts, in ways that are visible only to Him.  This spiritual process is much like the physical conception of a baby:  new life is growing within a person long before the rest of us can see obvious evidence of that fact.  SPIRITUAL BIRTHLINE is thus a great encouragement for youth leaders, missionaries, pastors, lay people . . . every believer who desires to see others come into the family of God.  Design-wise, the book is tight, a quick read, a great size to stick in a backpack or a briefcase, ready to pull out to use in a small-group setting for discussion and study.  It's a useful tool.
