City of Bones by Michael Connelly is the third book I've read by this author, and the second in his Harry Bosch series.  Connelly never fails to deliver with his mysteries and City of Bones was a real page-turner.

Harry Bosch is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department Homicide Division.  When human remains are found in Laurel Canyon, Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, are called in to investigate.  A forensic anthropologist determines that the victim was between the ages of 10 and 12, and was severely physically abused throughout his short life.  Since the bones have been buried for over 20 years and there is very little evidence, Bosch and Edgar have an uphill climb in trying to identify both the victim and the murderer.  As always, there are a number of factors that complicate their case.  The police chief wants the case wrapped up quickly without regard to whether they've identified the real murderer.  The press is relentless, and someone on the inside is leaking them information.  And Bosch finds himself romantically involved with a rookie police officer-something against department rules.  Bosch is a meticulous and tortured officer, and he leaves no stone unturned in trying to find the real killer.  Even when he has a confession in hand, he doesn't believe the case is closed.  

Michael Connelly writes gritty, hard-nosed mysteries which are more realistic than most writers today.  Things don't always work out for the best, and police don't always follow the rules.  City of Bones is not a fluffy work of fiction and Connelly will have you guessing until the very end.  It's also interesting in that Bosch ties in some local history of the La Brea Tar Pits and two murder victims discovered in the pits that dated back 9000 years.  

After finishing City of Bones, I next plan to read Connelly's Concrete Blonde.
