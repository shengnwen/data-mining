I love this book. I purchased it over a year ago and keep it by my bedside.  I refer to it on a continual basis.  This is the perfect book for the person who is (or wants to be) on the path to enlightenment. If you are ever feeling afraid or upset and read this book, even a few pages, it is difficult not to let these feelings go and go to a wonderful, calm place in your mind. I pick it up to remind myself continually just how unimportant the day-to-day stresses in our life actually are. All stress is 'self-induced'. Highly recommended for the 'open-minded' person!
