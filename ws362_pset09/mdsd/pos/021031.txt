Unlike so many dull counting books (and their companion dull alphabet books), this book has a quirky attitude all its own. "One" shows Johnny happy alone, reading a book; as we count upward, a number of raucous animals and even a robber invade his home. We start to count down when Johnny threatens his uninvited guests, "I'm going to count backwards and when I am through/If this house isn't empty, I'll eat all of you!" My 16-month-old son loves it & so do I. I wish they made this in board book form
