As many of us know it is writen by one of the greatest mistery novel writers. So you have the garanty that it is very well writen. The story is about a trial agains the tabaco company Bioxy which has united forces whit all of the other tabaco companies .Everything has been working out for them until now. but there is an element surprice on this trial.  there is a lot on play and everyone has to win to  survive . they will do anything to make sure the counter part doesnt win.
if u have never heard about this writer he has a lot more novels i believe that all of his novels have been made movies an the reason is becuz they are so good.  so i hope u enjoy.
