Time goes on and the protagonists Leaphorn and Chee are back for one more puzzling crime. Bernadette Manuelito has messed up a crime scene and Jim Chee is upset with her about it. Leaphorn is finding leads even though he is supposedly retired. The stories of Chee and Leaphorn weave together in a now predictable arc that has pretty much been used in every single Hillerman novel. But in the end, its nice to meet up with two interesting and engaging characters and its easy to overlook a tired plot device. 

I have never understood why Hillerman didn't stretch his imagination a little more with these books. The strengths are 100% in the characters and the evocative interactions they have with one another. The mystery is just background noise after a while and takes a second seat to the Navaho country that unfolds throughout every book. I am allways reminded of 'Murder She Wrote' and how Angela Landsburry stumbels across one murder after another and how they are all wrapped up in similar regards. This is in my mind the only thing that holds Hillerman back from being a true master of his craft
