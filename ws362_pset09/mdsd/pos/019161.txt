This is the best book I've read regarding the RV lifestyle. As an Escapee, a 50-something free spirit with a wife who has lived all her life in Astoria, Queens, this book says it all about the freedom from the corporate  world. For those of us having to work on the road, nothing was mentioned  regarding finances. This is the only shortcoming of the book. It takes guts  to do it but the rewards are many
