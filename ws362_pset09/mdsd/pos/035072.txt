LANCE STAR SKY RANGER admirably succeeds by adding to the current resurrection of the pulps in bringing back a nearly forgotten genre--that of the aviation hero. Writers Frank Dirscherl, Bobby Nash, Win Scott Eckert, and Bill Spangler contribute high-soaring, fast-paced adventure tales that build upon and add to the existing mythology of the Golden Age of Flight. 

Fans of G-8, DOC SAVAGE, and the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs will feel right at home. The volume is an impressive debut, handsomely illustrated by Rich Woodall.
