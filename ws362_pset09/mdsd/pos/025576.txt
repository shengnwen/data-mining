To read Moses, Man of the Mountain, is to read the    book of Exodus in the Old Testament Bible.  Ms Hurston has a wonderfully unique style of presentation.  Zora's book of Moses is one of the most entertaining, refreshing approaches of story- telling I've come across in a while, especially in the biblical realm.  I was so moved by this book, I went on to read many other works by her, such as &quot;Their eyes were watching God&quot;, Jonah's Gourd Vine, etc....I have mentioned to many others of how Moses, Man of the Mountain touched me in so many ways!  Zora Nell Hurston indeed appears to have been a woman before her time!....
