I checked this book out of the Cashiers, North Carolina Library and spent  a week browsing it. It has many fascinating color plates of North  Carolina's historical quilts. There is an early embroidered farm scene  quilt that is particularly spectacular and worthy of reproduction. There  are also many black and white vintage photos of North Carolina's quilters  in period dress. I spent almost as much time looking at the vintage  clothing photographs and the names of the women as I did the photos of the  quilts. This is not a &quot;how to quilt&quot; book, but I think the photos   and historical information in this volume would be beneficial to anyone  interested in primary source research in vintage clothing and quilts of  southern origin
