As usual I think most of the other reviewers expect too much from an author who lives and works in CR but is not Costa Rican.  It is based on hard earnt experience from what I can see rather than an academic study which is what most of us will also have to go through.  The book could be deemed to be somewhat self serving and pumps the author's website etc., but to be fair this is stated and if people take the time to look at the website it remains up-to-date in a way the book cannot as time goes on. I found the info. on the website pretty useful. That being said there is also a lot of useful information in the book and it does deal with a number of the pitfalls that can plague people as they venture into a new area.  Having lived in many places like CR over the years I can tell you that a little bit of self promotion is nothing compared with what can be encountered if you do not do your research!   To conclude then I would read and enjoy this book for what it is and take away the useful pieces that you can as it is a good starting place.  Good luck
