I just finished the book and perhaps am dealing with cognitive dissonance.  I did like it.  How can I not like it if I read all 800 or so pages?  I think it is worth reading, despite some of the harsh reviews posted here.  It seems to me that many great writers (as Irving certainly is) as they advance in age become untouchable to editors.  This book is in need of some good editing but I found the characters interesting and just incomplete enough to be real.  The unanswered questions in my mind about Alice (Jack's mother), Jack himself, his father and some others are appealing to me, not off-putting like they are to some other readers.  So I would suggest reading this book the way you should look at modern art.  Don't try to understand and dissect every word or every character, instead let it wash over you a bit
