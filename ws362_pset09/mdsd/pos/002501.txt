In a first reading of "THE VALUE OF SCIENCE", it may look like that Poincar works' main contribution was to expose the science in XIX. But looking further the surface, you can realize his great influence in the work of important scientists from the last century (i.e. Einstein, Heisenberg and Bohr, for instance). In "THE VALUE OF SCIENCE" and "SCIENCE AND HYPOTHESIS" there are lots of insights about Relativity, Uncertainty Principle, Correspondence Principle, Mathematics Incompleteness, etc. If in one hand we have that Poincar approached lots of genius questions and his answers are no longer seen as right, on the other hand, as himself have said, some mathematicians let themselves be guided by intuition, making some quick achievements, even insecure ones, as if they are daring knights in the front line.

Poincar is not just the greatest science philosopher of all times ever and an outstanding genius as a mathematician and a mathematical physicist, he was also elected to the Acadmie Francaise in 1909, what is a proof that reading "THE VALUE OF SCIENCE" is a delighted and funny duty
