i loved the honest attempt in this work to deal with Poe's alleged alcoholism,something hinted at or dealt scantily with in other biographies. As if a writer would somehow be afraid that by dealing with the alcoholism issue,Poe's works could be downgraded.(NOT POSSIBLE!!)The way this biography is presented,Poe comes off as being a seedy,yet noble character in a real life Poe tale,so as life imitates art.Lots of goodies here in this biography,if you only read 1 biography a year make this one your project.the Foster Brooks moments keep the book rolling.still this a serious work on a serious,interesting personality. Who was the real Poe,the writer,the philosopher,the seeker of beauty in all its forms,or the at times petty,vice driven man of ambition.From reading this book i would say Poe was both and maybe more as well.Ithank Poe everytime I have to absorb criticism of my amateurish attempts at poetry,i in turn read my critics material and say "well your poems aren't exactly "The Raven" either!! Poe may have been a "binge" type alcoholic,sober most of the time and then losing control at times,this would explain the discrepancies from descriptions of him as noted by numerous sources.Being sober 99% of the time,that other 1% can get you every time.Also covered in this book is a good description of Poe's service in the United States Army as an artillery seargent.Most people don't realize that he served 2 years with honors and i wouldn't have wanted to be on the receiving end of a cannon sighted and calculated by Poe!If in the .5 of the 1% chance he was inebriated even less
