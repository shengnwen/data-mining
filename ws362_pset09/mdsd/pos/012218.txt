I was in awe with David's first book and honestly was a little curious how he could do better.  I can not even begin to say how incredible this book is.  Not only is it work of art from a purely aesthetic point of view, but the imagination this man has is truly a gift.  If you want to throw a huge party or simply want to impress that special someone this is A MUST!!
