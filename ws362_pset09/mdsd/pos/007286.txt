My sister ordered this book for me for my  birthday.  I was so excited when I opened the package and found the wonderful pages to document  my reading, copy favorite quotes, list books I loved as a child (and still  do), keep track of books I want to read, and more. This simple organizer is  lovely!  It has numerous wonderful quotes about books and reading from  various sources. I took several evenings to browse through it thoroughly. I  still enjoy just looking at it. The paper is of a very high quality. The  colors are minimal to prevent competition with the reader's entries. If you  love reading, get your hands on this  little gem to store all your favorite  memories of books
