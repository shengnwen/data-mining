This childrens book was a great choice when discussing midieval times.  It was an enjoyable read.  The book &quot;Days of the Knights, A Tale of Castles and Battles&quot;, combined fiction with non-fiction.  The story  was told with action and drama while the reality of items that were used to  fight such a battle were illustrated and explained. By doing this, the  author, Christopher Maynard, spun history with fable to create an  adventurous escape into midieval times
