I don't really know what I can say about this book, but I'm sure I'll find the words... Nevermind, I have them. If you pick it up and expect the Disney movie, you're in for one of the biggest surprises of your life. At the beginning it seems to start out slowly because some of the characters introduced weren't in the Disney movie at all, so you're like... "oookay, who are these people?" However, this book was so great. It was very sad and depressing, but it had it's happy moments, which is always nice. 

It was amazing, and one of the best books I have ever read. Disney is a butcher of good stories!!! Arg! (This, however, is just my opinion. If you're a fan of Disney and I have offended you, I do apologize.)

I loved his writing style, with how descriptive he is with the setting and the characters. Victor Hugo does it so well that you feel like you are actually in Paris in the 15th century, and that you actually know the characters. They were portrayed so much differently in the book. My favorite character was Dom Claude Frollo, and I thought that I would have hated him, especially since he causes virtually all of the horrible suffering in the story. Weird, huh? I also liked Quasimodo for his kindness despite how unfortunate he is. He's constantly ill-treated, but he still keeps his good-natured soul.

I'm sure I'll be picking up copies of some of Victor Hugo's other books soon as well. The ending of this book brought me to tears, but I don't know about anybody else, since nobody I've talked to has read it. 

I'm the sort of person who cries easily, and I became very attached to the characters. This book is filled with death, but some of it made me smile. I loved the ending even though it was tragic, but I won't spoil it. Go read it yourself. Not all stories can end happily
