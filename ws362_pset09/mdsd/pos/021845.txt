This book is my new bible for everything from the best biscuits my husband has had since his mother's to baking mini bundt cakes for gifts that are moist, delicious and use ingredients I already have in my kitchen  cupboards!  I have yet to make a bad receipe from this book.  Some of the  main dishes can subsitute for a light supper! Hats Off To A Job Well Done
