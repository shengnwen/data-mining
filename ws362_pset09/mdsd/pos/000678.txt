While fortunately, I have had few, if any attacks on my work, just "tweaks," but nothing like by Brian Vile "Brian." What bothers me about his review, if you can call it that, is that he attacks my character, and not my ideas or research (book won an academic history award in 2002 for its research). I have been and remain very open to anyone who will approach or contact me to talk about my ideas, in both the books as well as number of studies posted on www.d-n-i.net. It is apparent that when someone attacks the author's character, that they do not have the knowledge to attack his ideas. Also, Brian Vile does not know why I HAD to remain at Georgetown so long, so another error, assuming that I remained in order to avoid troop serving assignments. This is always been a flaw in the culture of the Army created by up or out, if one does not get promoted or selected, they must have done something wrong?
