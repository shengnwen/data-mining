I can't say I find Toole's writing to be flawless; he strikes me as someone who had a hard time presenting more than one fascinating character per story. But there are certainly some vivid, wonderful moments here, and the detail - about boxing and about life on the fringes of society - is certainly memorable.

The two stories that make up the movie "Million Dollar Baby" are both here, and if you like that movie, they are both worth a read. Clint Eastwood made some interesting adjustments to them, but much of what Toole wrote is in the movie.
