In writing "The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text," Sidney Greidanus has provided us with a scholarly yet lucid hermeneutical and homiletical treasure. There doesn't appear to be an abundance of original material, but rather a quality synthesis and reworking of the best material in the field. It is written from the Reformed mindset, and yet, my dissimilar background still left me in agreement with the vast majority of the material. 

The author emphasizes application of the text to the modern reader through the use of systematic hermeneutical principles. He overviews the subject of biblical preaching and encourages an expository approach. The historical-critical method of hermeneutics is analyzed and appraised, offering a preferred holistic method instead. Then the sciences of literary, historical, and theological interpretation are also examined, as well as preaching forms and methods for bridging the historical-cultural gap between the Bible and today's listener. Finally hermeneutical and homiletical principles are applied to the four distinct Biblical genres of the Hebrew narratives, prophetic literature, the Gospels, and the Epistles. I found this section of the book most beneficial. 

Greidanus' work is not something I would recommend to the layman or the novice. Those unfamiliar with the subject would discover portions of the book difficult and tedious. At the same time, I would imagine any seasoned student of hermeneutics and homiletics would find "The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text" rewarding and well worth the investment
