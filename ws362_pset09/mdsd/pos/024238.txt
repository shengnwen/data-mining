This is a great book.  I have several dogs, and the techniques for training work on them all.  However, it is  great for my independent pup, a Dogue de Bordeaux.

She was always interested in something else, shutting down when she had enough.  Which she will still do, but now I have a way to impart information in a manner she learns while still keeping training sessions short enough to keep her interest
