In a word, "Glorious!"

Like AL CAPONE DOES MY SHIRTS, this is one of the few young adult novels that transcend the label "Young Adult" and become a highly recommended novel for anyone. 

Gorgeously written with a treasure trove of figurative and poetic language, this story (told from a fifth-grader's perspective) deals with a realistic world where a mother can be mean and self-serving and not interested in at all in what's best for her children. Hopeful, sad, thoroughly rewarding, I can't recommend this book enough. 

I WILL be using this book in my eighth grade classes this year to explore figurative language in writing, as well as international cultures, and look forward to sharing this wonderful book with my students
