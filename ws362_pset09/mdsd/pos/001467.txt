I really did enjoy this book very much, the only reason I did not give it five stars is because at times the pace got a little slow. There is not necessarily a happy ending to this story, which I liked. The book was very well researched, I especially enjoyed learning about the art of illumination. So much so, in fact, that I went online and continued doing some research on my own. If you love history, which I do, you will really like this book for all it's historical aspects. The romance lover in me enjoyed the book as well, I especially loved the romances going on with supporting characters, especially Half-Tom and Magda, a part of the story that turned out well for these characters. I also loved the part about Julian the Anchoress. I had never heard of such a thing, an anchoress, until reading this book. Julian had some very revolutionary ideas about feminism and I loved reading about that. All in all, it was a fairly satisfying read and was definitely not a waste of time
