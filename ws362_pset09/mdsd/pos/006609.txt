Cole offers an informed criticism of modern economic and developmental theory. His evaluation of supply versus demand economics should ring true with most informed readers. In addition, the &quot;abstract labor theory of  value&quot; is presented in a concise and clear manner. Unfortunately the  work is overshadowed by Cole's intense desire to interpret crises and  development in a Marxist fashion. His evaluation of the East Asian  financial crises leaves much to be desired. In contrast, his writing  pertaining to Cuba are beyond reproach, in this work as in past works.   This work is best enjoyed by those with an open mind or by those without a  religious following to more mainstream economic theory
