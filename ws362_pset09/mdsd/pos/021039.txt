Having had to wait 10 years because of infertility, I was so ready for children.  When Jordan came into our lives, I had so many questions only this book could answer.  I got to know the milestones a baby should come across, the things we as parents are to expect and the missing details that a pediatrician can't have time to dwell on because of the busy schedule he/she keeps.  Have you ever experienced that?  How many of us enjoy a visit to the pediatrician that spans 30 - 40 minutes?  Not many.  So this book helped.  When our second child arrived miraculously (we were told that we could not have anymore), this book helped us once again to determine that because of missing milestones, we had to be concerned about our baby's mental and physical health.  I highly recommend this book to new moms because if you can't remember to ask your doctor every question you had, ask the book.  Read, read, read.  It was our baby bible.  And by the way, our first book has been passed around so many times.  It has gone to another state in the USA, Hongkong, China and Singapore.  And I just bought another one for a colleague.

Enjoy the baby and the book
