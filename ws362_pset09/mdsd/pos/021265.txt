I loved this book! The person who would really enjoy this book the most is someone who likes books that are very adventurous and a little mystical in a way. It is always making you think of what will happen next. I think the protagonist is a little rambunctious at times, this is hepful for her to survive. If she wasn't so energetic then she probably would not get away from the antagonist DomDaniel. The book in general was very interesting. It was funny and sad at the same time. I really enjoyed this book
