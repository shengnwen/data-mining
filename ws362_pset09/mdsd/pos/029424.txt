For those who have read "Stocks for the Long Run", this is right up that same alley in terms of style and no-frills content, after all, it is written by a researcher.  However, this is a great book with lots of wisdom to digest.  Siegel discusses the "growth trap", a very counterintuitive point that everyone should be aware of....it alone makes the book worth reading.  If you are a serious investor/advisor it is a must read.  I would caution those who would take this book and start trying to manage a portfolio of all high dividend paying stocks...Siegel's conclusions are insightful, but the right application of them is still critical.
