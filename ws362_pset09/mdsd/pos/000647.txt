I read the book and thought it excellent, so I purchased the audio CD for my mother.  Unfortunately, after listening to half of NIGHT DRAWS NEAR twice, she gave up on the book.  According to her, Shadid read his work at such a quick clip that he was difficult to follow.  After listening to a disc myself, I agree (and remember, I'd read it in book form first).  Because of the complexity of many of Shadid's sentences, a listener needs lengthier pauses than Shadid gives one in order to digest and truly appreciate all that has been written.
