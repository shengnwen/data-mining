(No Major Spoilers)

Relic being my first Pendergast novel of the 'series', it holds some dear memories for me.  This is a stand-alone novel, filled with mystery, some obligatory gruesome killings in the New York Museum, and some potentially fantastic characters that are merely introduced here and kept rather flat, since action is the focus of this book.  That doesn't keep certain agents and writers from being quite awesome, though, and my appreciation for them is what the book left me with, rather than the focus of the action, which I found surprising for a thriller.  My experience has been that the average thriller only has characters to advance the plot and often doesn't bother to give them a real personality.  Yet in this book, there are intruiging and endearing characters who have a life of their own outside the action, and especially in books to come.

There are some great scenes in this book and the writing, as in all Preston/Child novels, has both wit and humor embedded in both description and dialogue.  The beginning starts out slow and might deter more impatient readers, but it does build up pretty quick if you give it a chance to.

This is a beautiful book, if not just for its own sake, for the sake of the characters it's spawned for the future.  Forget the movie, which incredibly cut out the best character in the book, and give this a try if you like mystery, investigative action, sci-fi realistically presented and the potential to enter an entire world of thrills and excitement, starting from Relic and not yet at an end, seven books later
