Even if his first 3, Nuala Anne, Irish Gold Books were more than exceptional; This is an engrossing story combining some of the good Father Greely's best characters. And surely isn't his the   Irish gift of spinning a wondrous story when given the best cast of characters. After Dermot, his precious 3 childre his arwesome fey bewitching Lady Nuala Anne, who not only is sexy but can sing along with the best Irish Folk Narratives, "Alive/Alive-Oh, and Sweet Molly Malone," there are two well trained Irish Wolf Hounds!  

The counterpart Family, a well-known South Chicago Irish brood of John Patrick O'Sullivan starts as the breeding place for the scape-goat son as Damian (Day) Thomas O'Sullivan. The complex story is under-scored by a companion story of the yet-to-become famous of Father Dermot Michael. All-in-all Sullivan's young son Day becomes the surprising hero and budding artist who joyfully specializes in painting dogs and children in solo, duo, & trio!
