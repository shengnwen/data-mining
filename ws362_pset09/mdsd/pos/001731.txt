I love this series.  Watching the antics that Amelia and her brood get into is so entertaining.  There are a number of years between the action in the previous book and this one, but not a lot has changed.  Ramses appears to have spent quite a bit of time roaming around on his own, and he has matured quite a bit.  Amelia and Emerson are just the same, and they are as hilarious as usual.  If I have any complaint it is with the character of Nefret.  As much as I love all the other characters in this series (and they are all like old friends to me after reading all the books up to now), I just can't get myself to like Nefret.  Her character does not ring as true as all the others.  She is a spoiled little girl who tries to act like Amelia, and fails miserably at it.  Anyway, this book is full of the usual villains, forgeries, tomb robbers and assassins.  There is enough action to keep any reader happy.  I can hardly wait to read the next book in this wonderful series
