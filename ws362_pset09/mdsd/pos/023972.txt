It is not surprising to read that the author of HALFWAY HOUSE Katharine Noel, has spent time working with the mentally ill as this book is very believable as well as beautifully written.   Noel describes the repeated roller coaster rides that define the life of manic/depressives realistically  and without undue sentiment.  Though we sympathize with Angie we never forget what a difficult, needy and often unattractive person her mental illness has made her. Yet through her experiences she retains insight into life and at times a sense of humor.  The book tells much of the story from the viewpoint of Angie's mother, father, brother, and brother's girlfriend/wife.  These characters are all well drawn - warts and all.
