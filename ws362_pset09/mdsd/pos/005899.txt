I gave this book 5 stars, not because I really liked it, but because it's  interesting.  Three Guineas is VW second book that is an argument and not  fiction (the first is a room of one's own).  It's about how women can help  prevent war, and it says a lot of stuff, one of the things being to link  male vanity to aggression. It's controversial, and a lot less pleasant than  a room of one's own.  It's weird in retrospect, too, because her argument  stands in another time - before the second world war - and we've all  changed since the holocaust etc. It says a lot about feminism, too, and  women entering the professions and getting an education.  Like I say, it's  more aggressive than ARoOO, and this makes her less likeable. Whether or  not you like it, though, or agree with what she says, it's an argument that  should be out there.  It's something that should be said
