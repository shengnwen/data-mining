Years ago I attended a 2 yr. technical school, which required taking a speech class in addition to electronics classes.  The text of my 15 minute  speech was extracts from 'Harvest of Sorrow.' I knew the speech was having an effect of sorts, for a class full of fidgety post teen guys slowly moved their attention from hand held games and car magazines to me, with their mouths hanging open.  I finished my speech and left, thinking nothing more of it. 
The next day, a teacher from another class approached me, saying, "Do you know that you are now famous?  The speech teacher raved on and on at our  lunch after the class, saying that you had the entire class riveted to the floor with that subject!  He said that after 14 years of teaching speech, your effort forced him to give his first 100% grade for a speech!" 
It strikes one to think that there is so much WW II stuff on the History Channel that it is now called the Hitler Channel, but they will barely give one hour a month for a far greater demon (Stalin) and a far worse system (Communism.)  Why?
