My son really enjoyed this story of a young orphaned girl "chosen" (to her dismay) to leave her country and go to America by herself, leaving behind her grandmother. The pictures are excellent, and the story moves quickly. The story  provoked frequent questions by my son such as: "Why did Jessie have to leave her homeland and her grandmother?" and "Why did the villagers think going to America was such a good thing?" Because Jessie was a child, my son identified with her. A beautiful story
