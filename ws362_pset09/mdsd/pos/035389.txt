HOW WE DIE came into my life when I needed it most--as I faced the impending passing of my mother. Dr. Nuland's words were not only medical and accurate, they were also comforting. We need to know how to die, how to prepare for it, and how to recover from it. We live in a culture where dying is hidden away in hospitals and our lack of experience leaves us absolutely terrified. HOW WE DIE calms our fears, and even though words cannot take away the shock and sorrow of death, this book brings much needed and timely solace.
