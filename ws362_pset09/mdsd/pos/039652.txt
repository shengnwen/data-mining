This book doesn't tell you what to wear. It tells you what not to wear and gives you the confidence to realize what you should be wearing. I expected a clear cut, "if your body is this shape, this size and you're this height you look good in, such and such and such and such" but no, it just gives you ideas not specific wardrobe assignments. And yes, what you wear CAN change your life, for the good or for the bad don't forget it goes both ways
