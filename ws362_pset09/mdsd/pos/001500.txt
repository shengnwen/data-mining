I enjoyed reading these 2 little books! They were very interesting! In 'Quiditch Through the Ages' it had a wonderful history of the magical sport! It made you feel like it had really happened, and that's what great books are supposed to do! The 'Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them' was inspiring, it put your imagination to work! 
They are silly and even have comments by Ron and Harry! These are great companions to the Harry Potter series! Plus a portion of the money goes to an organization for underprivilidged children! A great buy
