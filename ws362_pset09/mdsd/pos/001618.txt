If you are into Meg teeth you will be into this book. With hundreds of quality photographs and easy to understand information this book has it all. I have purchased many books on the subject in the past, but this one has them all beat. Thanks to Mark Renz I can now easily identify all of my finds. A must read for anyone who hunts or collects fossils
