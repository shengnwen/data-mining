I found this book helpful in identifying what I was doing wrong as a woman, and in defining concretely how men think.  I have read other dating books and it just seemed like the same repeated jargon or it was generally one sided, but never defined how to make both sides see eye to eye, or gain better understanding.  This book cleared up alot of questions for me.  Thus all things made perfectly good sense after evaluating where past experiences went wrong.  Yes its a book of advice, but then again all self help books are.  I will say that this was an easy read, and i didnt feel like i was reading a college literature book, and it didnt bore me.  I recommend all women look into this one.
