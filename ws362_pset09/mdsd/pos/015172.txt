Before I go on, let me just state that I am well aware of some of the complaints from people about Kyrtian being a boring character, the authors' overemphasis on all things Elven.  There are even some ridiculous claims of illogical plot.

My reply to the above complaint is that those comments come from people who simply did not follow the series well nor tried to understand the land of the Halfblood Chronicles.  Or, they simply do not have enough common sense to understand life and society in general.

Anyway, the book itself is best described as inconsistent.  There are some extremely well-written parts, where the plot is developed at an adequate pace to keep readers' attention while still giving detailed descriptions.  The plot itself adheres to the name "Elvenborn", as the main character in this book is someone who was born an Elf.  The decision to shift the series to be looked through the eyes of an Elf who was a human-sympathizer definitely enabled readers to gain a more intimate understanding of the Elven microcosm.  However, I do think that a lot of readers may not have the adequate grasp on politics and sociology to appreciate the intricacies that Norton and Lackey embedded throughout the story.

To summarize the inconsistency: this book does a very good job to draw readers in to the story in the beginning.  The book subsequently fails sporadically to keep readers' attention with certain slow-moving parts.  But my biggest complaint of all is, ironically, also the book's highlight: Elvenborn has an absolutely spectacular end sequence with the intensity that I have not seen in any other books I have read recently.  I can only wish that the rest of the book were as good as the ending.

The end of Elvenborn achieved, if anything, a rekindling of my faith in this series after the Elvenblood let-down.  Now if only they can rename the anticlimatic title of the fourth book:@Elvenbread, even though I'm sure that Norton and Lackey picked that name for a good reason
