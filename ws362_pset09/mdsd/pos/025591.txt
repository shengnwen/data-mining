I like Konstantinos quite a bit. With his books, all of them, its all the subject matter and everything is cliches put to legitimate books. Vampires are cliche, Summong Spirits cliche, nocturnal witchcraft and gothic grimoire cliche. It amazes me no one ever made something like this before. Put the author knows what he is talking about and has some charisma. I liked this book I was looking for something just like this where I could try and commune with the dead electronically. On a side note, I had been looking for Konstantinos' book Contact the Other Side and I finally found it, only to find out that it was retitled Speak with the Dead as it is here and given a makeover. Why didn't anyone do this before? Konstantinos must've been the one who started these now cliche phenomena.
