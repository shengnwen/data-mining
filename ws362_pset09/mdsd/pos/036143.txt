Blackburn takes a different approach to introducing philosophy:  rather than provide a chronological survey (a la Will Durant) or a cartoon-&amp;-sidebar summary (a la the Dummies and Idiot books), he focuses on eight of the most important philosophical problems and invites the reader to work through them, with the author's help and guidance from some of the leading thinkers in the Western tradition.  He is by and large successful in this effort, pitching his discussion to the &quot;intelligent&quot; beginner.  By the end of the book, you have both observed philosophers at work and taken a crack at philosophy yourself
