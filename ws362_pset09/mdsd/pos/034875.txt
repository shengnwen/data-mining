Faeries is the absolute greatest art book when it comes to fantasy, and that is because of the content, and the artists involved, as well as the quality in which it was printed and published in this, the 25th Anniversary Edition.

The book itself is compiled like a visual atlas of the world of Faery, exploring all of the separate regions and, more importantly, the inhabitants living there. In this book, you are taught how to protect yourself during your travels through the lands in this book. It details some of the most majestic of faeries, including the watery Asrai--faeries who melt into a puddle of water when exposed--some of the more horrifying creatures, like the faeries of the Unseelie Court, and beastly goblins like the phooka, a creature that takes many animal forms but is mostly generous in spirit. There are many more, all highly detailed with both pictures and handwritten captions, and often depicted in the environments they call home. 

This is a keystone book in the world of fantasy art, and the authors and illustrators, Alan Lee, who made the concept art for the Lord of the Rings movies, and Brian Fround, who continues today to create more and more faery related art, have since gone on to flourish in their careers. If you have an interest in fantasy art, or are a lover of fantastical worlds or a believer in faeries, then pick this book up. If you just enjoy high quality art, like myself, then I'd also recommend this book
