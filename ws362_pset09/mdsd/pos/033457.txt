First-let's get the issue of the "forced sex" part on the wedding night-which was dissappointing, disgusting and completely devaluing an otherwise great book-out of the way.

 Besides that almost fatal flaw-The Heiress Bride is a very good to great book! I love the characters in these novels-the Sherbrookes are fun, but flawed-wonderfully weird, and I was happy to see Sinjun and her brothers back-it's like seeing old friends again.

 I like the way Coulter writes this family, the time period, and the interaction between characters-and I for one love the "ghostly" aspects in each book-they're fun. They do live in old manors-you'd think they would have have ghosts?

The love and or sex scenes could have been written better. I think most fans problems with the book is they love Sinjun from the previous novels-and wanted her to be cherished and appreciated and not seemingly ridden roughshod over by her husband and his family. Happily, Colin does learn the error of his ways and comes to truly appreciate the wonderfully flambouyant Sinjun:)

All in all-if you're a Coulter fan and have read the previous two Sherbrook books-you cannot miss out on Sinjun's story.
