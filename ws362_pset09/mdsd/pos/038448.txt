Prey is a classic Crichton thriller in that it takes cutting-edge science which the majority of the public knows little about, mixes it with taut action sequences and scientists too willing to step way past any ethical boundaries, and creates a foreboding sense of fear for the future of mankind.  Almost as much a horror tale as a science fiction piece, Prey has a coherent narrative and a chilling sense of dread about it that makes it a better read than Crichton's Next (somewhat scattered and over the top) or Timeline (not relevant enough to the average reader to be that scary).  In some ways it harkens back to and updates mood and the plot of Andromeda Strain.  The topic, nano-particles and swarm intelligence, has a futurist cachet, but still relates well to the average reader's experience and fears and, of course, makes Prey a less controversial read than Crichton's State of Fear (dealing with global warming).  While not quite at the level of Jurassic Park, Prey is a page-flipping techno-thriller which both frightens and educates.  Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion
