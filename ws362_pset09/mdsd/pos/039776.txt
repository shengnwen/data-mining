This book is set up differently from others I've seen in that it is divided into categories such as plants, animals, water, etc.   The result is an easier reference than some other books I've used.  Definitions are well-written.... as if the author is speaking with you rather than dictating dry facts.  The illustrations are lovely, too.  On the downside, the illustrations take up space that may otherwise have been used for additional listings.  This book is, I think, a matter of quality over quantity, which is fine for me
