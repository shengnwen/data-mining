Russert has distilled a large number of readers' letters into a very readable book.  There are a number of truly inspiring stories in this collection.  There are, however, a few that were disappointing.  I also found a few admittedly minor items rather annoying: the commentary by Russert at the start of each story doesn't really add much; and the chapter on baseball should have been named "The Yankees", as Russert manages to ignore just about every other team in the sport in favor of the pinstripes.  Still, it's enjoyable to read some of the many ways that fathers influence their children's lives
