I thought the book was fun to read. A friend of mine used it as a guide for a church group study on the Theology of U2. It was a hit. We ended up discussing really important issues like Justice, and Money, etc. We would read a few chapters and watch the videos and then discuss. The way the book is structured is what positively differintiates it from other U2 books.
