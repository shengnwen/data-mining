This book is truly one-of-a-kind. Written without chapters, it is the free flowing diary of a young English girl who experiences the plague firsthand. Mall's unique personality and Jill Paton Walsh's direct writing style make this book a wonderful one. I was disappointed to read some of the other reviews which condemned the book for being too boring. If you fell that way, you obviously aren't able to appreciate this kind of book and should leave it alone. This is a historical fiction and not everyone likes such books. But if you are that type of reader, this one is for you. Thank you JPW, for a book I'll never forget
