Remini's thesis is that the Battle of New Orleans was critical for the self-esteem of the young republic.  The victory of New Orleans allowed Americans to once again hold their heads up with pride, and Andrew Jackson was crowned, national hero.  Remini attributes the victory of American troops to Jackson's Charismatic leadership, and the British leadership's failures lack of intiative and understand of the logistical demands of their invasion plans.  Remini evidence is persausive on tatical issues on field of battle, but is less convincing on issues of symbolic importance of the Battle of New Orleans to the American people.  However, Remini use of primary sources is commendable. The use of journals of British officers and Jackson's personal letters add credibility to the work.  This book is a good starting place for those interested in the Battle of New Orleans or want an introduction to Andrew Jackson
