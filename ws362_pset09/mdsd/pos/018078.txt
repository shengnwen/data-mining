John Le Carr� has written a touching spy thriller that traces the transformation of a man who loses his wife to a diabolical intrigue, and sets out to discover who is responsible.   The suspects are multinational pharmaceutical companies--as Le Carr� puts it in his epilogue--"It is about individual conscience in conflict with corporate greed".  

This story is prescient in its timeliness.  In 2006 more articles are appearing in the press about the undue influence of pharmaceutical companies upon the medical profession.  Some believe this is a conflict of interest for doctors.   Le Carr�'s story posits the use of third world nations as testing grounds for drugs that have not passed sufficient clinical trials, and the mega-billions that rest on such exploitation.  

The writing in this novel is superb.  Le Carr�'s writing is spare and poignant.  He lucidly describes the inner life of his lively and vivid characters.  The tone of the novel is deeply sad and disappointed; it clearly points out where humanity is still failing to rise to its full moral potential.  Despite its mordant critique of the greed of corporations, The Constant Gardener provides high quality entertainment and suspense.  Well done--highly recommended
