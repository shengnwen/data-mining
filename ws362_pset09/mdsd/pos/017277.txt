I have used this book in my high school junior English classes, and for most students it is very helpful. It's true that it's harder to write quizzes on the words because of the cluster method, but that's a teacher's problem, not a student's. The clusters do help them remember words that are related. I've talked to SAT prep instructors who highly recommend this book. Unless you're a vocab star, give it a try
