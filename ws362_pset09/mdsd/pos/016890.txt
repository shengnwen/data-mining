This is the best book I have ever read on stock investing.  I have probably read 25 books.  It is the best because it is applicable.  Many books will tell you to buy what you know, to buy companies with sustainable competitive advantages, to buy companies with better Management etc.  However, it is impossible for the average person to find this out, unless they spend hours reading the 10k's.  This book gives you techniques that the average person can use.
