This is a very well written, very thoughtful study of the last 30 years of the criminal justice buildup in this country. This book goes beyond complaining -- it explains with history, theory and rich empirical detail why the US has so many prisons. I've read several books on law and order, this is the best. Excellent for college students or regular folks
