This book not only explains the differences between men and women but also gives strategies to each sex for dealing with those differences. For example men and women have different values. Men tend to value competence and accomplishments while women tend to value relationships. Women tend to express their caring by offering unsolicited advice that is often causes men to feel incompetent. Women need to express how they feel about their problems, while men interpret this as blaming them for their problems. Men often need time alone to solve their problems while women interpret this as not caring. If everyone practiced the methods in this book the sexes would get along much better. The book, however, is at times dry reading.
