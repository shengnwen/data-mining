My favorite part of this book is the author's suggested path of study in her Literary Conservatory chapter, which presents a four-year writer's curriculum (nothing like this was offered at any university at the time this book was published in the mid-1980's).  To help writers study their craft, accompanying the writer's curriculum is a huge suggested reading list, meant to be read in order (from the oldest works of antiquity to newer works up until about 1980).  I'd love to see the author expand on her idea of the Literary Conservatory and write a sequel to this book.  It'd make a great independent study option for those who are unable to enroll in a formal college literary writing program, but who would still like to pursue a formal course of study designed just for hopeful would-be authors
