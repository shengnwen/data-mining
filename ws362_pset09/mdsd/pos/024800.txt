It is rare to have a collection of stories all about canines.  This book has four of them.  I enjoyed all four fairly well, but I did have my favorites that I cheered for as the stories progressed.

 

"Red Shirt and Black Jacket" follows two bloodhounds as they search for a murderer through the backwoods of Georgia.  The dogs and their handlers are not afraid of the culprits but the criminals in hiding were sore afraid of them.

 

"Nightmare to Nowhere" tells of a woman that had an accident, or so she thinks, whom a German Shepherd leads from the scene of that accident into a mystery life.  The Shepherd knew where he was going but how far dare this woman trust him?

 

"The French Poodle Connection" was perhaps my least favorite.  This could be because I have never really adored Poodles.  The story is interesting and canine lovers will find it interesting as the story traverses through a mystery.

 

"The Case of the London Cabbie" is very good.  J.A. Nance keeps the story moving and interesting.  Two Golden Retrievers share a story of "who is what they say they are" and "who do we believe?"  You will find this mystery fast moving and intriguing as you watch the characters weave their way to deception.

 

All in all, if you like dogs and mysteries, you will not want to put this book down.
