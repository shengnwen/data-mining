I remember reading this as I was growing up in the 70s. Every Christmas, it would come out and my sisters and I would spend time reading through, scratching and sniffing the panels. And like others, we definitely wore off some of the panels with our aggressive scratching.

Well, my oldest son (4) recently got the latest edition of the book (which his Nana gave him - I'm pretty sure she still has the original somewhere). He wasn't sure of it at first, but soon got into it and insisted on reading it at least once a night. And of course, he's got to be the one who did the scratching. It's a fun little story that moves along but isn't too long to lose the attention to the story. He even insisted on putting the candy canes on our tree this year because of this story. Reading it with him brought back the memories (I loved the hot chocolate smell, in particular), and I smile when I see him enjoying it like I did.

I can guarantee he will ask to have this one brought out next year, too
