This book covers a lot and is written where it is quite easy to digest.  Her tone is similar to other favorite authors of mine and this always seems to keep me reading. Also recommended, Mommy-CEO, by Jodie Lynn.  I received both books as gifts and they are a must have for every household who want to finally get cooperation and peace back in the house and love back in the relationship with your kids - and hubby too
