Unabridged Audio Book
Reader: Robert Lawrence gets an A+.
This book held my interest from the start. I thought the plot twists were good. I especially liked the mystery of the missing "suicide" victim.. I listened to this book in my car and there were a few "driveway" moments involved in the process. The reader can make or break and audio book and Robert Lawrence was definitely a maker.
