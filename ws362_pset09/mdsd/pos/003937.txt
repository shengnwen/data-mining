When I finished the book "The Catcher in the Rye," my initial thought was, "Did I like this book or not?" It was hard for me to figure out. Even though I felt like there wasn't a complexed or structural plot, I still couldn't put it down. Maybe it was the easy-to-relate-to memories of Holden Caulfield, or maybe it was the depth in character that was described. "The Catcher In the Rye" is based on innocence in childhood and a boy who is afraid of the corrupt world of adulthood. Throughout the novel, I got an understanding of what Holden Caulfield was like. The characterization is accurate and it could definately be a real person; Holden's thoughts were consistant with his personality. Holden uses defense mechanisms to get away from the real world in which he fears so much by having an extremely negative attitude and putting other people down by saying they are "phony". All Holden wants is security without change. This is demonstrated with the museum he like has liked ever since he was a little boy. He likes it because it is something that never changes over time and stays innocent. Also, throughout this novel, if you pay attention, you can see that everything is linked to everything else. Holden's red hunting hat relates to his brother's and sister's hair for example. This book is filled with symbolism, complexity, and a sense of human nature. My conclusion was that I definately do like this book. It was intriguing to read into someone else's life and see things from a different perspective. If you are someone who enjoys suspense and structural plots, this is not a book I would recommmend for your reading. If you are someone who likes to relate to characters and see out their eyes, this is the book for you
