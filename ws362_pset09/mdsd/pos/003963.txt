I purchased and read the last Rain book, "The Last Assassin", first.  I was captivated by the character, a middle aged former Ranger and CIA assassin, who is more motivated as a righteous avenger, than a well paid mercenary.  I had to go back and read the Rain novels in order, to learn the history that shaped the man he has become.  Barry Eisler, himself a former CIA Operations operative, realistically brings you inside Japan and the Far East, with generous helpings of government corruption, organized crime, and heroes and villains with serious character flaws.  A great mix of intrigue, geography, history, along with great story telling.
Definitely a MUST READ, as are the next 3 books in the series
