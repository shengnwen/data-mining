This book is geared specifically for those who wants to be an effective entertainer/speaker/magician in front of large audiences. Although, I have found many of the general suggestions intriguing, much of the book is dedicated towards "working the crowd".

Obviously, its intended readership is rather limited. And I, for one, didn't find its suggestions very helpful since I hardly ever need to make public speeches. But if you are a budding magician or speaker, then this book provides some streetwise suggestions on how you can be an effective master of the stage.
