The Rick Steves guides are more update to date than other guides. It's clear in  using the 2003 and 2004 editions  that Rick has recently updated the books . Other guides seem like fact checked revisions. Rick's books give me  info that only someone that has "been there" and "done that" RECENTLY could provide. Besides all of this, Rick is one heck of money manager.  I was sometimes thrifty and sometimes not, but I always felt I got my money's worth thanks to Rick 's advice about what's worth it and what's not
