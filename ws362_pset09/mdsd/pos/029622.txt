If you're looking for mere facts &amp; statistics, this may not be the book for you.  But if you want a more &quot;personal touch&quot;, and especially if you believe new mothers should be honored and pampered, get this book!  What I love most about it is the absolute reverence the author shows for childbirth and mothering.  Most other baby/mother care books may have helpful info, but read like the owner's manual you'd get with a new appliance or car.  This one has useful information, but also emphasizes the emotional and spiritual aspects of having a baby.  Even if you don't plan to use the Eastern-based references to diet, exercise, etc., reading about other cultures' approaches to birthing and mothering can be quite a valuable contrast to the Western (highly medicalized) perspective
