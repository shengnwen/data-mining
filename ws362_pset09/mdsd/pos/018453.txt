LIVING THE SCIENCE OF MIND IS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMINAL.  IT IS LIFE CHANGING.  EVEN THOUGH IT WAS WRITTEN YEARS AGO, THE PRINCIPLES OF LIFE STILL APPLY, AND THE WAY IT IS WRITTEN IS LIKE MUSIC TO THE HEART.  WE LOVE THIS BOOK, ARE READING IT OUTLOUD TO EACH OTHER, AND GAINING SO MUCH INNER PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING.  WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER BOOKS BY ERNEST HOLMES, AND THEY ARE ALL PHENOMINAL -- SIMILAR TO THE ABRAHAM-HICKS BOOKS.  LIFE ENHANCING.
