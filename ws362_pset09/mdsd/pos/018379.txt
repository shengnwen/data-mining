Someone Like You                                      
Sarah Dessen                                                                                       

      Have you ever had a decision to make that would change your life forever?  Well, Someone Like You is a story about a very true friendship and a love story.  The main characters are Halley and Scarlett.
      Scarlett has always been known to be the socially popular girl, and Halley has always been known as Scarlett's quiet sidekick.  Scarlett has always been there for Halley through her most difficult times.  Now, it is Halley's turn to repay her friend when Scarlett's boyfriend is killed in a motorcycle accident, and Scarlett is pregnant with his baby.  That is when everything begins to fall apart.  It becomes very difficult for Scarlett to decide what to do.  Scarlett will need all the support she can get from her best friend Halley.
      Once I began reading this book, I could not put it down. There was always something interesting throughout the book that kept my interest.  I have to say, this has to be one of my most favorite books. The characters are great. And Halley is always supportive even though she has so many things going on in her personal life. I really think it is easy to relate this story to real life. Sarah Dessen also has another book called This Lullaby, which you can relate to and also understand how the author likes to go through a teen's true feeling in life, and what a teen gets out of through each experience. Sarah really brings her books to life and her heart of writing into it. I love that.  Someone Like You is a great "page turner", and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Realistic Fiction. This book really opens up your mind and your thoughts about life. It can teach you something if you really look into it and pay attention.
