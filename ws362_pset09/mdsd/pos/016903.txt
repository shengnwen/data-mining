Sherlock is a dog who has escaped from a university lab where gene splicing and neuron stimulation have made him intelligent and able to talk. Fifth-grader Amy and her friends find that keeping the dog's identity secret from grown-ups results in all sorts of unforeseen and hilarious complications. &quot;Smart Dog&quot; doesn't quite measure up to Ms. Vande Velde's best (&quot;A Hidden Magic,&quot; for example), but still I found it an enjoyable read: Sherlock and his rescuers are likable characters, the school bully gets her comeuppance, and all ends happily. If you like humorous dog stories, you might also want to read Peter Dickinson's &quot;Chuck and Danielle.&quot
