One of the biggest questions that every Star Trek fan asks is this: what happened between the end of the original series and the first movie? How did Kirk become an admiral, why was Spock trying to finally divulge himself of his human heritage, and what happened to McCoy? The Lost Years Trilogy answers all these questions.       The first instalment from 1989, 'The Lost Years', by now-veteran Trek author J. M. Dillard was a Star Trek classic. It has been on my bookshelf for almost 10 years, and I have read it many times. Brad Ferguson's 1991 novel 'A Flag Full of Stars' is a worthy sequel, examining the blossoming relationship between Kirk and fellow-admiral Lori Ciana and the continuing adventures of Spock and McCoy.       The Klingon co-star of the book provides Ferguson with a way to delve into the still-relevant issue of racism, and how even the bad guys sometimes produce a hero. The whole issue of the exploitation of altruistic scientists and their ideas is also examined here, providing a neat allegory for the emergence of nuclear power.       The ending, a direct, and nail-biting cliff-hanger, shows that Kirk, ever the swashbuckler, was never intended to pilot a bureaucrat's desk through uncharted frontiers of paperwork, a theme that runs through this book, reflecting and explaining events and attitudes from the first two Star Trek films.       It is an absorbing and exciting novel, and while it is not as well-written as 'The Lost Years' it is still of admirable quality compared to many other Trek authors, comparable to the work of long-time fan-favourite Michael Jan Friedman. It is also a vital piece of Trek continuity (and a thoroughly enjoyable one at that) that no fan should be without.        The greatest tragedy is that, as yet, I have been unable to track down the third and final instalment that would take the trilogy up to the events of 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. It was slated to be 'The War Virus' by Irene Kress, but it still eludes all my attempts to pin it down.       Nonethesless, this sad fact cannot detract from the value of the first two parts to the trilogy. 'A Flag Full of Stars' is a worthy addition to the Star Trek mythos, and not only is this good Star Trek, this is good science fiction in its own right
