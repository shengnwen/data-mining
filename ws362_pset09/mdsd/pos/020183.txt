I HAVE HAD THIS BOOK SINCE IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED AND USED IT SO OFTEN IT'S FALLING APART.  THE COLD YOGURT SOUP IS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD AND THE GRAPE LEAVES WITH CURRENTS IN THEM AND THE CHICKEN WITH RICE AND APRICOTS  HAVE BEEN MY PARTY STANDBYS.  THE STORIES HELP MAKE THIS A DELIGHT TO READ  AND THE DIRECTIONS ARE EASY TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU HAVE SOME COOKING SKILL
