This book covers every area you need to know about in order to get and stay fit and healthy.

The book evens gives you suggestions on when (how often) you should get certain tests, exams, and immunizations.  It describes many tests and what outcomes you should look for in each one.  It also includes a Health Risk Analysis for you to take.

It covers all aspects of Aerobic Fitness as well as Muscular Fitness giving you suggestions, tips and photos demonstrating different exercises.

The book is so complete it even covers nutrition and other basic health information.  This section includes a long list of foods and their caloric content as well as the caloric expenditure during various activities.

It also covers different diets giving you the good and the bad and telling you which ones you should avoid.

There's so much more in this book than there's time for in this interview.  My suggestion is to get this book - even if you are into fitness you will learn something
