Of all the many books like this, and I've seen and owned most of them, this is one of the best.  The best I've encountered is Hans Jensen's "Sign, Symbol and Script."  
This one is good for getting a quick and brief description of many script systems, but Jensen's will give you the most detail that I've ever encountered of any alphabet
