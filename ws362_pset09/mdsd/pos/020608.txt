Mr Piston is one of the few authors I have come across who has a thorrough understanding of the limitations of the instruments he chose to write about. One can see this especially through hid portrayals of reach, uses, effects, etc.

However, it is worth noting that he could have used a bigger variety of examples from different composers. He also abides to the most common and stereotypical manners of combinations, etc
