I've got Trager's 1997 book--The American Book of the Dead: The Definitive Grateful Dead Encyclopedia--and have plucked it off my shelf numerous times.  I'll be doing the same with his latest effort, this Dylan encyclopedia.  It is interesting that with all the Dylan books out there, it took until 2004 for something like this to appear.  For the hardcore aficionado, this will be similar to Krogsgaard's Positively Bob Dylan and Heylin's Stolen Moments (as far as its usefulness), but to the casual observer it's a chance to get to know the songs Dylan has chosen to record and perform--not to mention biographical info.  Photos throughout, and enough details in its 700-plus pages to keep one busy throughout 2005 (and 2006 and 2007, etc.)  It's not dry either, I'd say Trager has a fondness and apprecation for the music.
