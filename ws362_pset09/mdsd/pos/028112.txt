For years I start every Sunday with a cup of coffee and Valerie Easton's gardening column in our Seattle Times Pacific  Magazine. It was with great anticipation and excitement that I bought her newest book, Plant Life, a collection of her new and past writings on the garden. Her writing is both personal and informative, humorous and stimulating. The book is organized by months and seasons and would be very useful in planning and planting a year round garden. The helpful photos by Richard Hartlage are first rate and lush in saturated color. I found many suggestions and ideas that I would try in my own garden. Her personal observations about plants and experiences in her garden opened my eyes to my garden and the &quot;beauty&quot; that I had created in my own world. I highly recommend this book to both active and arm chair gardeners....
