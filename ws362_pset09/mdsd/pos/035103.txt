Grisham writes suspense stories, and this one certainly qualifies.  The plot involves a 24-year old girl who figures out a shocking double-murder and as a result is being threatened by Bad Guys.  That certainly does lead to suspense!  Of course, much of what happens in the story is illogical, but that's okay as long as the book works on its own terms.

And the book often does work on its own terms.  For example, at one point our Heroine witnesses an explosion.  Shortly thereafter, a person identifying himself as a policeman comes over to her.  But he's not really a policeman!  That's clever, it's imaginative, it's masterful, and it increases the suspense.

On the other hand, Grisham simply omits the part where the Heroine figures out who is behind the murders.  That detracts only mildly from the suspense, but it displays quite a bit of laziness on the author's part, and it contributes significantly to the overall shallowness of the entire work.

More surprising to me was the mishandling of a typical suspenseful situation.  At one point, Our Heroine thinks she's doing okay.  But she isn't: a Bad Guy is trying to kill her and a Good Guy is trying to save her.  Well, what do most folks do with this sort of situation?  They write about the race between these two people and that adds enormously to the suspense.  Or, they could write about it from the Heroine's point of view, which is almost as good an option.  Grisham, to his discredit, tells about the Heroine and the Bad Guy and omits the Good Guy.  In theory, I guess this could work sometimes, but it sure doesn't in this case.  

This book is plenty of fun for the two or three hours it takes to read it.  And it makes me wonder just how long Grisham took to write it
