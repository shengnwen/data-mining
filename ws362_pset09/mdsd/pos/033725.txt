This is the book that started the whole WWJD craze of the late 1990's.  After asking "What would Jesus do?" before every decision, the members of Henry Maxwell's church realized how far from true Christian living they were, which called for major changes in their lifestyles.  Today, the WWJD movement is strongly criticized by some Church people, often citing reasons similar to the opponents of the movement depicted in the novel itself.  Hmm...sounds like the novel had some prophetic quality.

I highly recommend this book in its original form.  There's no need in butchering the story as is done by the modern retelling that was more recently published
