I found the Little Mac Book very helpful with a lot of good, basic information to get the beginner off on the right foot.   The information was clear, and the step-by-step directions were easy to follow.  It was full of extra little "tips" to make things easier.   A few times, I wish the author had offered more details, but I guess that's another book
