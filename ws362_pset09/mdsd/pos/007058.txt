This is the sequel to the famous and fun book '101 Dalmations', and though some of the characters come back, it's a quite different story.

One day, all the dogs in the world wake up to find that everyone is asleep except dogs, though later also two cats and a young human boy, who are 'official' dogs. 
The dogs are not hungry, and they can open doors, fly, and do just about anything they want. Pongo and Missis try to find out what has happened, and one of their first suspects is Cruella de Ville. Cruella is around, but she is asleep and selling 'clothes that clank' with her husband, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the mysterious sleeping. 
Pongo and Perdita `swoosh' (fly) over to london to meet with their daughter, Cadpig who belongs to the prime minister. 
Cadpig seems to be the main character; she is the one who did almost not live at birth (in the Disney movie this is Lucky, but in the book Lucky is the one who has spots in the shape of a horseshoe).

After many attempts to find out what is wrong, they solve the mystery and must face a decision that could change the nature of the very world
