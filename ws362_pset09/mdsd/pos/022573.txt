My friend has this book, and I've looked it over a few times. It is an  excellent guide, a must for the performance engine builder! It shows  everything from heads, how to weld them, straighten them, even port and  polish them, to bottom end work such as balancing, which rods to use, what  pistons you should use for a particular application, even shows how to use  a welder and a milling machine to match the top of the piston to the  combustion chamber for high compression! If you want to performance-build  your Datsun/Nissan engine, this is the book for you
