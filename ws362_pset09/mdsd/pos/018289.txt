Gogol no doubt took the position of the short-story master after the death of Pushkin.  Best known for his flowing prose with a nice zest of folklore, Gogol's foundation of realism was to remain and influence latter greats  such as Dostoyevsky and Turgenev.  In this delightful collection, Gogol  demonstrates his versatility as a mature writer through famous tales such  as The Overcoat and The Nose.  The Overcoat tells the story of a sincere  young clerk who makes great sacrifices to attain an overcoat of untold  value and power. Representing the mighty bureaucracy, Akaky Akakievich dies  of a broken heart when his beloved smart coat is stolen. Gogol then goes on  to showcase his forte as a whimsical and humorous writer, when Akaky  returns for his coat of significance from a personage.  This process  certainly symbolizes the reprisal of lower class against the dominance of  the ruling class.  Nose on the other hand, is a brilliant depiction of bad  story telling: jamming paradoxes as well as antithesis into one giant blob  of nonsense.  Yet it is just through this technique to recreate a fresh  narrative that helps Gogol to unarm the ossified minds of readers who have  been pampered by the way "story should be told"
