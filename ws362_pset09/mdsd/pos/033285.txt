This was my first exposure to the Tibetan book of the Dead.  Basically this book is an  instuctional guide for traveling thru the Bardo; the period or place  in which we find ourselves  after death, and before  incarnating into our next life or form.   The book gives a very detailed  description of the deities and phenomena one can expect to encounter in the  Bardo, and the actions one must take to facilitate  an optimal incarnation.   It also instructs on the practices that we should engage in while living,  to prepare for the Bardo, and  therefor have the best out come of that  experience.  In addition, this is a guide for facilitating and guiding  another person thru death and the Bardo.    This is a straight forward  reading of the book by Gere, it is clear and easy to understand. He is easy  to listen to. The descriptions of the various  dieties get a bit long  winded as he decribes at least a hundred of them. Some of it is gruesome  and down right scarey sounding.  But the basic thing to remember is, that  it is all emenating from our own mind, and not to be overcome by fear.  Exposure to this information,  practice and meditation on these deities can  help prepare us for this experience. Apparently, if we take the correct  actions (or non actions) in the bardo, we may not have to continue in  samsara but can go directly to the Buddha state, or at least an incarnation  in one of the more pleasant realms.  I am fairly new to Tibetan Buddhism,  so my interpretations of what I heard may not be a perfect reflection of  the actual teachings. But that is how I heard it
