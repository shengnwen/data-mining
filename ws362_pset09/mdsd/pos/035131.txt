First of all, I think Thomas Mann is without doubt the very greatest 20th century author! I am familiar with about everything he wrote, as well as his very interesting life. But I have found Dr. Faustus to be simply very rough going. The book's basic theme is outlined by many other reviews here. Though a very serious subject (life and death and the horrors of WW2), there is still not the wry humor I find in Mann in his other blockbusters (MagicMountain,Buddonbrooks,Royal Highness,Felix Krull,etc), so that solemnity overwhelms this great enterprise. In fact,in my humble opinion, the 2 best parts are his descriptions of prehistoric life under the sea, and the bombings of great German cities. The characterizations seem a bit dry, with nothing like the amusing personages in say, the Magic Mountain. And the descriptions of musical compositions practically require an advanced degree from the Julliard School. So these small criticisms simply suggest that great patience, learning, and thinking are required to fully appreciate this great novel, and probably this reviewer does not have these three qualities in ample quantity to really appreciate Dr. Faustus!
