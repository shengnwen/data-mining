This book reminds me of my most important asset; the people on my team.  In the middle of the book are Management Gems.  The Gems include formula for Top Managers, Leadership Myths, as well as steps for performance oriented mangagement.  These Gems are must reads daily.  Thanks for making something so tough, easier to apply
