Really helpful book! Fournies gives 16 reasons why employees (and maybe peers or others) fail to meet expectations. The book doesn't just give a list, though. It gives succinct insight into how to tell which is the  reason in a particular case. Then, once we have the cause identified, it  gives good advice on how to correct the root cause. I found it very helpful  in handling failed expectations of others -- sort of Sun Tsu's *The Art of  War* without the executions. &lt;grin&gt; I recommend this book as a tool  for managers at all levels to turn frustration into solutions
