I'm not particularly a fan of Martha's style, but I have tremendous admiration for the empire she's built through sheer vision and hard work.  She's one brilliant, driven woman and this book gives great insight into how she's accomplished so much.

This book is a great read for someone thinking of starting up a business -- or those who have already done so.  Martha is very direct and serious about how you must focus your energy into your business plan and execution.  She lays out very good ground rules for cutting the fat out of your initial dream and targeting concepts which will work.

I love how throughout the book Martha emphasizes the need for sensible passion (my term, not hers).  You have to love what you're doing, but you can't let your emotions overrule your business requirements.

This really is a terrific book and I'm putting some of the concepts to use in my own small software business
