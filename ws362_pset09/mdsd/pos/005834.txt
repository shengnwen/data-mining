This fact filled, technical book held my attention from beginning to end. The author obviously loved his subject and did an excellent job of explaining it. He gave clear definitions of the different types of DNA and how they are passed on. He carefully traced the DNA in each area of the British Isles. 

I learned about Picts, Celts, Saxons, Danes, Vikings and Normans. I also learned a lot of interesting history about the British Isles. 

To me,Mr. Sykes' book,The Seven Daughters of Eve, was a more interesting book. Perhaps, that was because DNA was totally new to me when I read it. Perhaps, it was because this book was more technical. Anyway, this is certainly a good read, very informative and interesting.
