This is an excellent morale boosting story for anyone with a wacky idea that just won't quit, and has been dying their whole life to say "Ha, I told you so!".  It's also a great travel epic complete with the quirky locals, the gadget guru, and a group of men willing to risk their lives for an ultimate adventure. 
Parts of the book did read like a 1960's documentary.  I could almost envision the "exciting world of color" technicolor intro and Thor narrating over the action.  But I think it all adds to the ambiance of the book.  It makes you realize in days before GPS and sattellite radios how crazy this band of pioneers really were.  Also Thor doesn't really get into the emotional implications of first signing on to the expedition, then being at sea with a handful of men for three months. Instead he spiced up the day to day desciptions with detail about sea life and what the crew did to entertain themselves.  I would have imagined the trip to be much more monotonous and morale killing then he makes it out to be, but it definitly makes a much more exciting read. 
I woudl recommend this book to any travel book lover.  It a classic of it's genre and a must read.
