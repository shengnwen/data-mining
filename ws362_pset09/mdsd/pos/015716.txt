Finally, we get "his" side of the story.  In this excellent memoir, Taubman reflects on his successes in the shopping mall and real estate world.  The details are fascinating and his entree into the world of high finance and the art world are entertaining...we learn that perhaps selling art is not at all like selling root beer.  When he stood trail for the Sotheby's/Christie's price fixing scandal in 2001, he went against his better judgement and intuition, and listened to his lawyers.  He never defended himself on the stand!  Sounds like his got terrible advice from his high priced advisors. I was left with more answers, but a feeling of a missed opportunity on his part.  Why did such an intelligent and clever man fail to speak up and tell his version of the truth when it was obviously called for?  If we believe his side of the story, the true criminals are still out there in the public - it is a scary tale- a miscarriage of justice and real life tale of greed and deceit.  Glad I got my hand on this book!  The lesson learned is this....ALWAYS trust your intuition
