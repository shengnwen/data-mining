When I heard Nora had written another trilogy, I was excited. Normally I can't wait to finnish them. However, I have only managed to get about halfway through this book. I found it hard to from the past to the present, and vampires just aren't my thing I suppose. Knowing me, I'll leave this for a couple months, then try to read it again.
Who knows, I might end up liking the book after all
