Savage Dragon is a piece of comic art and an under appreciated gem that came out in the early 90's. Overshadowed by it's distinguished sibling Spawn from the same company, this diamond in the rubble had some of the finest uncomplicated action and adventure than any of it's superhero competition. Critics have passed up the Dragon as a Hulk knock off but leave it up to it's creator, writer, and penciller to prove them all otherwise. Savage Dragon, filled with humor and surprises, is one of the most original heros of that decade and sure to be highly entertaining to all superhero fans
