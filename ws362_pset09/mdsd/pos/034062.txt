Crofton's Fire is a winner!  With prose that flows like clear water over white rocks, the plot is enticing and terrifying, but it's the fiber of the book that is truly amazing: in an age of cardboard heroes, Lieutentant Michael Crofton is the real thing.  He embodies all those American verities that we've come to admire: courage, honor, duty.  And on top of that, he is a wonderful husband completely in love with his beautiful young wife and as loving a father as to be found in all of literature.  The book is so good it's amazing to think it's Coplin's first novel.  There's action enough to satisfy the most red-blooded male reader and a sincerity and sensitivity to satisfy the most discriminating woman.  It's a book for every gender, with red, white and blue thrown in.  The moral dilemma of a young American soldier in an excruciating environment makes this a must read for any soldier in Iraq or anyone who has relatives there.  And on top of that, it's a darned good read
