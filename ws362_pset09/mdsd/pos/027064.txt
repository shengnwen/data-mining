THIS IS A MUST READ!!!   Mrs. Draper has true writing skills that worked magic throughout this book.  This book is classified for young adults but everyone should read it young and old alike. Mrs. Draper takes you from the very beginning with Amari playing with her brother in Africa, to being captured at the hands of her own neighboring tribe.  From the horrible boat ride to America, (in vivid detail) to Amari being sold to a plantation owner for his son's sixteenth birthday present.  Amari is left in the hands of a white indentured servant girl about her age to be made "civilized." You will have to read it for yourself to see what happens from here, you will not be disappointed!  I was full of so many emotions, happy, sad, angry, I found myself ranting aloud a couple of times. This book is not predictable by far; I found it hard to put down.  I rarely take books to work with me in fear of reading them and I just could not leave this book at home!  This book offered me knowledge and understanding and for that I am grateful.

Continued success to you Mrs. Draper.
