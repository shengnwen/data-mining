Teacher could use this to create a cross curriculum lesson using problem solving, deductive reasoning, and perceptions vs. truth. There are some great lessons to be learned from this story and Math is one of them. Children can be introduced to money values, counting, and estimating of time and container sizes.  Plus they can learn to use various coins to make the same amount. I enjoyed reading this to my family and seeing their reaction and problem solving skills at work.  The author also provides several lessons you could use in the class.  Great book for 2nd and 3rd graders to enjoy
