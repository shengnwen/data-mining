     Wide Sargasso Sea is an excellent novel. The author, Jean Rhys, tells the story of Antoinette "Bertha" Cosway Mason, the insane wife of Rochester in Jane Eyre. You will learn of Bertha's childhood, honeymoon with Mr. Rochester, and read a short section about her days in Thornfield Hall. The story drags a little in the second part, but overall the story flows very well. If you read and enjoyed Jane Eyre, I believe you will find Wide Sargasso Sea very interesting.
