I enjoyed this book very much. A person does not have to be a professional chef to enjoy this book. There are many French terms in this book, so beware; however, in context, a reader can figure out what the words mean (eg: I only had 2 yrs of French in High School and I was able to figure out most of the French terms,in context.  Also, the footnotes explain most of the French cooking terms). 

Anyhow, THE PERFECTIONIST is a book about the rise and fall of a famous French Chef. Before he died, he was one of the most well-known French Chefs of the times. He was fascinating!   The Chef was in love with cooking, but he was also in love with "making it to the top---quickly". His mental anguish (or mental disease) caused the Chef's fall and the author takes the reader ,step by step, through the ups and downs of this great Chef.  A sad story in the end, but a wonderful read because it explains how truly competitive the world of cooking (or Haute Cuisine)is....especially in the world of the great Chefs of France. 


Before I bought this book , I never knew how the Michelin-Star system works, but now I know........ Fascinating!
