My 3 year old son and I love this book.  The story is simple with a repetitive refrain that little ones can become familiar with.  The illustrations are perfect for the recommended age group; bright and simple with easy to pick out shapes, animals, and other figures.  The overall message about helping others is a good lesson as well
