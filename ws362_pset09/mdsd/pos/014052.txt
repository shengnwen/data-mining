I am surprised that, to my knowledge, no fiction writer in this genre has used the writers, actors, director, and crew engaged in making a bondage film as the scene for a novel. This is a legitimate venue for all sorts of variations and a strong plot element could be built out of putting something on the screen that is not so made up as one may think.The others who reviewed this book found it far more entertaining than I did.All in all, I thought a book such a Lessons in Obedience far more entertaining.Would highly recommend buying this with the first book Carries Story.
