As a Vietnam veteran who survived the Tet Offensive, I was deeply moved to read about the war from the "other" side.  Mr. Truong Nhu Tang describes in depth how dedicated the Vietcong leaders were.  They were "nationalists" who were intent on saving their country from politicians whom they perceived to be corrupt elitists.  After reading his description of life in the jungle it is a wonder any of them survived the hardships of such an existence.  The evolution of the Ho Chi Minh Trail was fascinating.  I was amazed at The dedication of the workers who were responsible for keeping the trail open...bomb craters from night bombing runs were either filled or detoured around.
