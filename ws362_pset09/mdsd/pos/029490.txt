I have used this book as a reference guide for everything between athelete's foot to zinc and I have found it to be very useful. In fact, I loaned the book to my brother and he refuses to give it back. I bought  another copy for me and a few more for gifts. Not everything that they  recommend works, but I have a high deductable for medical insurance, and I  have saved many trips to the doctor by reading this book
