Millard Erickson is one of the most prolific evangelical theologians writing today.  His CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY is (from what I've read) the most widely used systematic theology in Baptist seminaries.   The doctrinal perspective of this work is premillenial, baptistic and moderately Calvinistic.    

One of the advantages of this book is that Prof. Erickson doesn't bombard the reader with a list of theologians who have opined on various topics.  He takes a topic, discusses three or four key thinkers and options, analyzes them, and gives his own opinion.

Prof. Erickson discusses most of the major topics of theology, including important background areas such as biblical criticism, the relationship between theology and philosophy, and contemporizing the Christian message.  One area that Prof. Erickson skates over is that of women in the ministry.  Last I checked, Prof. Erickson is a member of a pro-women's ordination group called Christians for Biblical Equality, but you wouldn't know it from reading this book.  The discussion of women implies that he supports it, but he isn't as clear as one would expect.  (See p. 565-66.)

For even more conservative protestant works in systematic theology, readers should consider the works of Robert Reymond and Wayne Grudem.
