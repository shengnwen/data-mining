This is a great resource for those of us who are struggling with achieving our dreams, or just the social graces we were never taught. Horn goes into great detail in sections about making conversation, with step-by-step instructions on how to work a room and make everyone certain that you are interested in them (which, of course, you are). 
I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is having trouble reaching your dream, especially if shyness or lack of confidence is holding you back, The 30-day step program will get you where you want to go
