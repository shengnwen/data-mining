If you have a fascination with Imperial Rome and its Caesars, this book will keep you enthralled.  For anyone who's seen the visual performances on television of I, Claudius, this book will give you a greater insight as to what exactly happened.  Keep in mind the style of writing is dated, but then again, the author Suetonius lived almost 2000 years ago, still, if you can see through the translation, there's a lot of interesting tidbits here
