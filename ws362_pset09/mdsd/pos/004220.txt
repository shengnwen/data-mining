I was personally a little confused with the review written by Patty Benson, who claims that Sarah Ban Breathnach is Jewish and that is why she makes so many refrences regarding the Jewish religion. To begin with the author is not Jewish, she was raised Catholic. So the book is full of "Non-Jewish wisdom." Secondly, the book is not about religion which I feel people might assume from the previous review, the book incorporates elements from all religions and searches out the spirtual aspects within each that can be universally appreciated by everyone. And yes sometimes this does include quotes from Jewish mystics. If you're looking for a book that excludes the world at large and focuses on Christianity then perhaps you should read The Purpose Driven Life. If you're looking for a book that embraces the idea of "spirit" and tries to relate it to all walks of life then you should read Simple Abundance.
