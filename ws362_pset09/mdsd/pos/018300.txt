EM Forster's A Passage to India is, at first, a challenging book to digest.  A study in contrasts: Indian and British, Moslem and Hindu, male and female, it offers one final contrast to the reader: near boredom and high intrigue. It is as if Forster intentionally brought his audience to the brink of apathy before springing the event of magnitude upon them.  Startled from languour, Adela Quested's misfortune in the Marabar Caves becomes more pressing, more imminent, more real.  Aziz, the hapless facilitator, finds himself accused of a nefarious plot and, from there, the plausibility of British colonialism is explored in microcosm.

Sluggish for fully one half of the book and paced expertly in the other, A Passage to India is an ambivalent reading experience that provides, perhaps, more of the colonial experience than we first assume.  Given time, we recognize that an indolent, entrenched bureacracy jolted from routine suits the pace of this book to a tee.  I prefer Kipling's Kim when it comes to novels of the British Raj, though, on the whole, I found Forster's "Passage" a very worthy read. 4 stars.
