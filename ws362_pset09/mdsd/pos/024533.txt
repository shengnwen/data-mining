Dr. Ornish is a very respectable name in the cardiology field.  In my line of work, I look to promote my cardiologists who are based in four major hospitals in the New York City metro area.  Dr. Ornish should always be commended for his books.  Another cardiologist who is also excellent is Dr. Richard Stein at Beth Israel Medical Center in NY.  His new book, "Outliving Heart Disease" is another great read
