This book, in short, tells the spectacular tale (more like spectacular tail!)  of our relationships with animals. Although the subject can be seen as dry by many, Torrey and Yolken do a great job at making the subject lively and easy to understand. The subject especially pertains to us with the recent mad cow, SARs, and bird flu outbreaks. 

We as humans often get so caught up in our own species that we forget about the animals around us and their effect on us. However, we live in a highly connected world where animals play a very vital. This is why we need to have a book like Beasts of the Earth to point out these human-animal interactions that we encounter everyday.
