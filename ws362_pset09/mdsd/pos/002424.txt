I loved this book. It was very detailed, and very exciting. All of my questions were answered by the end of the book. The poster in their room is very mysterious, and it is like a story all it's own. The Shevvingtons are very different people, so it makes the book interesting. There aren't many other characters in other books that are like the Shevvingtons. Their house is also a very interesting part of the story. It all comes together wonderfully
