My husband and I, being new boaters, stumbled upon the Isle of Shoals.  I looked the Isles up on-line after our trip and somehow came across the book title and ordered it.  I read it in one day, only leaving the couch to pee.  I loved the alternate story style and each time It switched, I was left with wondering what was happening in the other story.  One would have to see this island to imagine who could live there for 5 years without being driven to insanity.  It was all very real for me and I agree that the author probably nailed the murders on the head as they actually happened.
