Wonderful anecdotes.  Great photos. Beautiful presentation.  Easy to read.

BUT, the TOC only lists page numbers for the albums, not the songs, and the songs are not listed in the index.  So if you're loooking for a particular song, you have to turn to the album and then HUNT for it.  Why?

A minor problem, but an unnecessary annoyance in an otherwise wonderful book
