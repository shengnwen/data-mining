 This book dealt with the actual paranormal and psychotic activities ellen Rimbauer dealt with as she lived in Rose Red. If you've seen the movie by Stephen King, this book answered the questions that the movie left lingering around. Ellen marries the very wealthy John Rimbauer and they build a house, not just a normal home but one that feeds on humans. This book; however, does tend to get very sexual and I would not recommend it to someone of the immature being. Someone who enjoys "ghost stories," if you will, would enjoy this book. I kept wondering how the house could feed off people. How could a home, made of wood, nails, and labor take lives, have its own mind, and keep building on its own? This book has opened many doors and has made me come to realize that there could be much more out there that what we are willing or are only able to see. Dr. Joyce Reardon has done a marvelous job editting this novel/diary. This book kept me excited and on the edge of my seat the while time
