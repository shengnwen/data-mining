In a very readable style, this dynamic book provides a comprehensive overview of all the different methods of relieving emotional disturbance by working with energy fields.  Dr. Gallo clearly and concisely explains the  essential dynamics of each energy approach.  The specific detail and  photographs of the methods used in Thought Field Therapy greatly assist  both the new energy therapist and the experienced practitioner to  understand the ins and outs of this dynamic new psychotherapy.  I devoured  this book, which was filled with gems of new knowledge in each chapter.  My  thanks to Dr. Gallo for putting this all down in such a powerful little  package! --by Barbara Stone, Ph.D., author of CANCER AS INITIATION:  SURVIVING THE FIR
