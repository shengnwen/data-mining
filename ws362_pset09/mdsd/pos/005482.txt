I found Living Religions to be very interesting and informative.  Before reading this book, I knew very litte about religions other than my own.  After reading this text, I discovered the beauty in each religion presented and was able to erase the stereotypes and stigmas that I once held.  I recommend this book to anyone who has little understanding of world religions and would like to become educated or for someone who may just need a reminder.  It is an easy read, with the exception of some of the vocabulary associated with the different religions.
