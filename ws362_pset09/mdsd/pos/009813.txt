The Year of Fog is impossible to put down. It's spellbinding. Captivating from the first page. Richmond shares an extraordinary insight with the reader, and with amazing detail, makes you feel as if you've known these characters forever. Hauntingly wonderful, this is the story of a woman who believes deeply in the power of love. 

I was a Reader Reviewer for Bantam Dell on this book and read a prepublication copy
