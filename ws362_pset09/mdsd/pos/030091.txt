I read this in Business School, in the early nineties. Although it does not have the depth or rigor of the real hardcore finance texts I was studying at the time, it was my favorite finance book - maybe because it is so well written or because it make the right blend of theory and practical advice. When it became time to start investing a few years later, I went back to it and was not disappointed.

In time, I found things I disagreed with Malkiel - I did find managers who beat the market consistently and one cannot completely dismiss technical analysis when so many in the market follow it. However, you'd have to mature a lot in the investment world to start to take issue with his ideas. For beginners, just eat it up with your vegetables
