Number 1 book in the charts: "The Da-Vinci code", soft cover.
Number 2 book in the charts: "The Da-Vinci code", hard cover.
Number 3 book in the charts: "Angels and Demons", soft cover.
Number 4 book in the charts: "Angels and Demons", hard cover.
So I thought I would give a try on the world's second most popular (and commercial) book.
Great writing I must agree on. Extreme amount of real-life knowledge on arts, history and religion.
Now I have to go to Rome and Vatican city.
And then the symbolism - I suppose it's quite an unique talent for one to be able to discover multi-layered symbols in almost every twist and turn of one's novel.
However some of it is so damn commercial and sometimes feels as if the author is expecting his book to be a basis for an action movie flick. Like Robert Langdon's bare-handed fall from a mile-high helicopter straight into Tiberius, not only surviving it, but managing to make love to an yoga-master the very same night...
Last but not least this book spawned many of a question in my mind, from the fictional development of massive amount of anti-matter to the practical proof of existence of a Creator.
Although not in exactly Christian terms, I am now more and more a believer
