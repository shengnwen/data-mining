Robbins can occasionally be a hard author to get started in, some of his other books have a tendancy to drag the reader down before they really get caught up in the story, however this is not true in Cowgirls.  It is one of his most accessible works (if not quite as good as some of his other work such as skinny legs and all) which jumps into such widely applicable topics as feminism, freedom, and the appropriate use of thumbs.  Fabulously profane (it is after all Robbins), at times raunchy, in turns surreal or gritty and earthy, this is a book that should be gotten for anyone unfortunate enough to be unfamilar with robbins.  (except perhaps your conservative 80 year old grandfather, who might experience heart failure five pages in).  Half asleep in frog pajamas is another good starter-robbins book
