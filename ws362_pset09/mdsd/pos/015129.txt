Well written and clearly laid out, this is a very useful book for the video production student. If you are thinking about buying the equipment, reading this book will help you to make up your mind between two of the most popular professional video formats. Also, if you are using the  equipment but have no access to the manuals (whether because you rent the  equipment or the boss/owner is playing &quot;information control&quot;  games), this manual will help you make the most of these top quality  professional machines..
