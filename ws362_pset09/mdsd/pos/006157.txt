First, this is an adaptation of the original story written by Leroux.  It's a good way to get kids interested in the Phantom of the Opera. I read this first, before I read the original novel. And I have to tell you, I read the book in one day! Seriously, for some reason I remember that, and a friend of mine read it in only a few hours. It's a very good book and the pictures are nice, too, wonderful black-and-white ink pictures that go very nicely with the story.

If you want to get your child interested in Phantom of the Opera I would suggest that you have him or her read this.

It's a lot easier to understand than the original novel. And if he or she wants to read the original then, they can. It's a really great book.It explains a lot of stuff that wasn't there in the musical.
