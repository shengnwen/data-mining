I really was not familiar with Sal at all until I read this book.  I've now seen several of his movies and have read even more about him at various sites on the Internet.  Having said that, I must say that by no means am I an expert on Sal's life.  It seems that there is some dispute among the other reviewers of this book- as far as some of the details of Sal's life.  I thought this book seemed to be impeccably researched and the fact that Sal handpicked Jeffers to write his biography (at least that's what Jeffers says and I really have no reason to not believe him; he seems to be a credible writer) gives this biography a certain air of authorization.  I don't feel, AT ALL, that the sexual details of Sal's life that are included in this book are exploitive in any way.  Although I was just a small child in the early 70's I have read enough to know that there was a sexual freedom that went on at that time.  Sal was famous- his life as far as sex goes does not seem to be out of line with what other famous people were doing at that time.  I felt that the reason why details of Sal's relationship with his family were on the &quot;light&quot; side was because Sal didn't seem to be that close with them.  He was living a completely different life on the other side of the country from them- they were not in his life on a day-to-day basis.  If people want to know the details of his family they should wait for someone in his family to write a book.  This book moves along nicely, it never seems to dwell on any one issue too much.  Included are many black and white photos of Sal that span his entire career- right up to his unfortunate death.  Great book that I'm completely glad I've read.  It will always have a space on my bookshelf
