I'm enjoying Umberto Eco's NAME OF THE ROSE, but I don't understand so much as a tenth of the Latin.  Before I reached page 200, I came to the sinking conclusion that I was missing out  on something.  I checked KEY TO NAME OF THE ROSE out at my local library, but soon realized that I needed to own my own copy to keep beside my copy of NAME OF THE ROSE.  This book is a God-send for those NAME OF THE ROSE fans like me who lack a reading knowledge of Latin.  Having other scholars' comments at hand really helps.  If you're intrigued by NAME OF THE ROSE, but just don't get it, buy this book
