A substantial compendium that will whet your desire for travel!  (...)(I have no affiliation with this website, but found this gem much in the same way I found this book, just  trolling the internet).

While the author's attempt at humor is clumsy at best (thus the loss of a star), this can be remedied (if you are going to Costa Rica) by another book of equal encyclopedic stature, "Costa Ricat the Last Country the Gods Made", whose successful levity works to shoehorn the historic & geologic facts into the reader's retention bin of a brain.

Happy Tropical Trails!
