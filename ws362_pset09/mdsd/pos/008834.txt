This was a fun project to do.  If the directions are followed exactly, it's not to difficult, however I think it might be more difficult for children.  It's a great way to build interest in this period in history.   It could be used as a springboard towards research about this historical  time period.  I also have put together the town.  It was quite a bit easier  and also a lot of fun.  I'm hoping to be able to do the castle &amp;  village next
