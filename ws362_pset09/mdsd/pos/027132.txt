There are some Pilates programs out there that don't give you results.  They are geriatric and wimpy.  I have been a client of the IM=X Pilates method for a few years and tried it at a couple of gyms. I just noticed they started a franchise chain.  IM=X is a superior workout that has proven to give me results.  I purchased this book and can't wait to see how the new mens format works.  The regular IM=X format kicks my butt.
