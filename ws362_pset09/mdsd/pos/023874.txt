I have read this, and then read the much-lauded Robert Fitzgerald translation, which is currently popular. The Ennis Rees translation far outstrips the Fitzgerald. It brings the magic and poetry of the Iliad to life, as I read it I went through my daily routine in a daze, I found myself thinking in Homeric verse. After finishing the book I only wished for more, Ennis Rees, truly understands the rhythm and the halcyon glow that is the poetry of Homer.      On the other hand I found the Fitzgerald translatiion, while easy to read, lacked a certain poetic beat, and lacked also the magic of the Ennis Rees translation. I found the charecters did not come to life as they did in the Rees translation. Although certainly the Fitzgerald translation, is a decent effort and much better than the priggish prose translation of Richard Latimer
