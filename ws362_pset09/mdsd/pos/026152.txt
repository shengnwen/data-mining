After reading David Pietrusza's book on Arnold Rothstein I have come to the conclusion that Rothstein was a man with only one love in his life, that of gambling.  He doesn't appear to be an individual who was able to develop any genuine feelings of affection to another human being.  Any interest in another person was limited to what they were able to do for Arnold.  His only interest in sports was limited to what the gambling odds were.  Although married he spent his evenings, not at home, but sitting at a table at Lindy's Restaurant conversing with business associates, not friends.  The author also relates Rothstein's role in developing the drug trade in America.  Gambling and bootlegging were activities that you need not be embarrassed about.  Trafficing in drugs, however, was something that was considered dirty and he masked his interest in the drug trade.  The book also goes into  detail of Rothstein's role in the 1919 World Series and others involved in the crooked World Series.  Details of Rothstein's death by shooting in the Park Central Hotel in New York by George McManus are also provided.  The author admits that some of the details are speculation, and will never be known for sure.  This is a book that will take you back to the era of turn of 20th century New York and through the 1920's.  It is also the story of people from the world of sports, theatre, politics, and the gangsters that made up this time period.  The book is most certainly worth your time and money
