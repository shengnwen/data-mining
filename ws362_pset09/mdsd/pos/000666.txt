Also available in a hardcover edition (159385157X, $45.00), Integrating Instruction: Literacy And Science is the collaborative effort of Judy McKee (Science consultant, Wilmette Public Schools, Wilmette, Illinois) and Donna Ogle (Professor of Reading and Language, National-Louis University). A part of the Guilford "Tools for Teaching Literacy" series, Integrating Instructions covers such topics as integrating science and language in science units, writing to learn in science, effective uses of technology, the connection that can bridge science-fiction to a passion for learning, and much more. Written especially to promote motivated learning in science and literacy alike, and offering tools to help assess student learning in agreement with national and state standards, Integrating Instruction is a valuable resource particularly in the twenty-first century when communication skills and practical scientific and technological awareness are more important than ever.
