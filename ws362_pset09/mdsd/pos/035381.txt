I found this book entirely informative filled with facts and beliefs of witchcraft throughout the world.  Without all the fluff and "new age" bright blessings this is what the real wica and witchcraft is about. I doubt seriously if those who claim an understanding of the subject will notice the difference in the term.  A throughly good read for someone who truely wants to learn about the subject with more meat on the bone and less hype. Baroja talks about the nature of the witch from the earliest historical period through the middle ages to the present and side steps the quamire of "new age" hokum to present an illuminating account gathered from art,literature,ecclesiastical and historical-legal documents. His presentation is thankfully free of the "blessed bes" and Dianic tripe and is a refreshing read in this age of socalled spell books an fabricated wicca
