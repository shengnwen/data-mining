This series in general, and the Jeter book in particular, are great for a 5-10 year old sports nut.  I read this with our 6 year old, a chapter a night for a couple weeks.  

It's well written and moves quickly.

It makes reading fun by being about something a sports fan kid will really enjoy.

And Jeter in particular is a good story because he's such an great role model for kids -- he crosses racial divides, espouses the virtue of hard work, respect and not taking anything for granted.  

Highly recommende
