This is the most complete, up to date paragliding book out there. It covers all of the basics in depth, but also has a lot of tips that will be of interest to more advanced pilots. Topics covered include kiting, launching, landing, aerodynamics, meteorology, thermals and cross country flight. In the accompanying DVD, the author, a U.S. Air Force test pilot, demonstrates maneuvers such as stalls, spins, and collapses as well as launching, landing and thermalling. Altogether a great value and excellent reference for pilots of all levels
