Detective Milo Sturgis has a cold case that is really bothering him - a young upstanding actor butchered and left in the trunk of his own car. The victim was simply a nice guy and it's a completely senseless murder and Milo is ticked off that there are no leads at all. Until another body turns up in another trunk - this time, a young psychologist who
worked at Starkweather State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Supposedly no inmate ever leaves Starkweather, but one barely functioning psychopath seems to be having  premonitions of murder and Milo asks for help from his old pal Dr. Alex Delaware.

It is an interesting story - lots of twists that get tied up at the end - some suprises. We learn a bit about our heros, which I always like (I'm in it as much for the characters as for the mystery), and lots of long suffering Milo, so overall, I enjoyed the book. For some reason, this one didn't make me want to stay up all night turning pages, though
and that's why I gave it only 4 stars
