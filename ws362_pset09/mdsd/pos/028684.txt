The Red Kayak is a story about three boys, Brady, Digger, and JT. Brady loves his life with his mom and dad on Chesapeake Bay crabbing and fishing, and just hanging out with his friends. But when the DiAngelos and their sparkling new red kayak move into the neighborhood, everything changes. Especially when the red kayak is taken out for a ride and the DiAngelos' son dies. 
When Brady discovers the truth behind the red kayak the question is whether he should tell the world what happened or keep his discovery a secret, which could cost him his old life.
I really liked The Red Kayak. If you're someone who likes a page turner, you should read this book. I felt that the author, Priscilla Cummins, really put the story together well and kept the story exciting throughout the book.
I would rate this book four and a half stars. What I didn't like about The Red Kayak is the ending. It was too much like reality for me. But overall it was a really great book.
