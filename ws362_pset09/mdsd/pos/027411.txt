This little cookbook is AMAZING!  Every recipe I have tried is delicious and unbelievably easy. I highly recommend Italian Sausage and Peppers - hearty and just the right amount of spice. The Portabella Stroganoff was a bit expensive to make, but well worth it - my family went wild over it. For an easy dish, make the Mushroom Parmesan soup. In the Irish section, you must try Vegan Shepherd's Pie - I used homemade mashed potatoes and it was to die for. Finally, the Tangerine Tofu is exquisite. I hope Michelle Rivera writes another cookbook soon
